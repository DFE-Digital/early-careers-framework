# API Reference

This documents the API that serves out post graduate teacher training course,
subject and training provider information. The version of the API documented
here feeds the UCAS Apply system.

# Authorisation

The server expects an API key to be included in a header for all API requests,
where `your_api_key` is the api key supplied by the becoming a teacher team:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

## Example

```shell
curl "https://api.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/api/v1/2019/subjects" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your issued API key.

# Retrieving Records

The "provider" and "course" endpoints support retrieving records changed
since the last request. This is intended to reduce the data transfer volumes
and processing needed to synchronise the UCAS apply system with DfE's course
data on a schedule.

You can control page size using the `?per_page=100` query parameter.

:rocket: _This feature is a work in progress and the API may not yet provide the stated
capabilities and interface_ - [trello
card](https://trello.com/c/HMAlga4l/852-implement-incremental-fetch-for-providers)

The expected usage is as follows:

## Populating an empty system

1. Call the endpoint with no query parameters,
   e.g. `GET https://api.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/api/v1/<recruitment_cycle>/providers`
2. The API will return the first page of records, and will include a response
   header indicating the url needed to request the next page of records.
3. Make another GET using the provided next page url.
4. Repeat until no data is returned. Keep a copy of the next-page url
   provided in the response headers in order to be able to fetch records that
   change after this initial load.

_The above can also be used to refetch all the data periodically to eliminate any drift
that has crept in over time_

## Retrieving changed records

1. Make a GET request using the next-page url provided with the empty
   response at the end of the last full or incremental fetch.
2. The API will return the first page of records, and will include a response
   header indicating the url needed to request the next page of records.
3. Make another GET using the provided next page url.
4. Repeat until no data is returned. Keep a copy of the next-page url
   provided in the response headers in order to be able to fetch records that
   change after this initial load.

Records will be repeated as new changes are recorded so the client **must**
be able to handle duplicate entries in the result sets.

The header will be of the form with the contents of `<...>` replaced with the
correct url:

```
Link: <https://api.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/api/v1/2019/providers?...>; rel="next"
```

**The query parameters are considered an internal concern of the API** and
**must not** be constructed manually in order to avoid losing changes. The
incremental update should only be performed using the next-page urls provided
in the response headers. With that in mind, these are the parameters you
should expect to see:

- `changed_since` - is an ISO 8601 timestamp stating the oldest change to include.


The header format is from [link header
pagination](https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/).

# Errors

The API uses the following error codes:

| Error Code | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400        | Bad Request -- Your request is invalid.                                                   |
| 401        | Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong.                                                    |
| 404        | Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found.                                   |
| 500        | Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again later.               |
| 503        | Service Unavailable -- We're temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later. |

# Preparation for the next recruitment cycle (rollover)

During a given recruitment cycle, there will be a period when providers have
two sets of courses to manage â€“ one set of courses that are currently
published for the current recruitment cycle, and unpublished courses being
prepared for the next recruitment cycle. Additionally, the providers who
deliver next year's courses may change, and they may have different campuses
for the same courses. The point in time when the overlap starts is referred
to as rollover, and typically happens in or around May.

To differentiate between entities from different recruitment cycles, each
endpoint has a `<recruitment_cycle>` part in the URL. Additionally, the
following entities have a `recruitment_cycle` attribute in the response data:

- course
- campus
- campus status

## Recruitment cycle URL parameter

`recruitment_cycle` - 4-character year (e.g. 2019 for 2019/20 course)

All the examples in this documentation include `2019` for convenience and
assume you wish to obtain information for the 2019-20 cycle. For future
cycles update the value in the URL, e.g. `2020`.

# Endpoints

## Courses

This endpoint retrieves a paginated list of courses.

- It is segmented by recruitment cycle, see
  [preparation-for-the-next-recruitment-cycle](#Preparation-for-the-next-recruitment-cycle-rollover)
- Results are paginated with a page size of 100 - see [retrieving
  records](#retrieving-records)
- It provides the capability outlined above for [retrieving changed
  records](#retrieving-changed-records).
- Results are sorted oldest update first.

### Example HTTP Requests

First page of the complete data set:

```shell
curl -v "https://api.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/api/v1/2019/courses" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

Subsequent pages / incremental fetch, using the "next" url in the "Link" header from the previous request:

```shell
curl -v "https://api.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/api/v1/2019/courses?changed_since=xxx" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

### What constitutes a course change

A course is considered to have been changed (and hence included in this
endpoint) if any of these are true:

- the course itself has been changed
- the campus status has changed
- campus associations have changed
- subject associations have changed

### Course codes

- are unique within a provider
- are not unique across providers
- are stable across rollover (i.e. by default, a course in a particular subject
  delivered by the same provider will have the same course code across
  different recruitment cycles)

subset of contact groups required by the DfE course publishing system is used for the contact types here. This list is:
