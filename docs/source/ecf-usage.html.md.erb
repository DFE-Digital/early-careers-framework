# ECF Usage

The scenarios on this page show example request URLs and payloads clients can use to take actions via this API. The
examples are only concerned with business logic and are missing details necessary for real-world usage. For example,
authentication is completely left out.

## Continuing the ECF registration process

This scenario begins when an ECF participant has been added to the service by a school induction tutor via the manage
training for early career teachers service.

### 1. Provider retrieves ECF participant records

Get the ECF participant records.

```
GET /api/v1/participants/ecf
```

This will return [multiple ECF participant records](/api-reference/reference-v1#schema-multipleecfparticipantsresponse).

See [retrieve multiple ECF participants endpoint](/api-reference/reference-v1#api-v1-participants-ecf-get).

### ECF Participant enters registration details on register for early career framework service

A participant is invited to continue their registration by validating their TRN and contact details.

When the participant has completed this step the ECF participant record will show;

* whether the email address has been validated
* whether the TRN is valid
* whether the participant has achieved QTS status
* whether the participant is eligible for funding

### 3. Provider refreshes ECF participant records

Get updated ECF participant records.

GET /api/v1/participants/ecf?filter[updated_since]=2021-05-13T11:21:55Z

This will return [multiple ECF participant records](/api-reference/reference-v1#schema-multipleecfparticipantsresponse)
with the updates to the record included.

See [retrieve multiple participants](/api-reference/reference-v1#api-v1-participants-ecf-get) endpoint.
