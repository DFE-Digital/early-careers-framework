# About the API

Lead providers must use this API to view, submit and update participant data so they receive accurate payments from the Department for Education (DfE) for their ECF-based training.

## API versions and updates

We regularly make improvements and add new functionality to the API. View our [release notes](/api-reference/release-notes) to find out about the latest updates.

If we change the API so it’s no longer able to work with older data or functionality, we’ll publish a new version. This is specified in the URL `/api/v{n}/`. For example, `/api/v1/` or `/api/v2/` and so on. We recommend lead providers use the latest version of the API.

When we make non-breaking updates (sometimes referred to as backwards compatible updates), we will not re-version the API. An example of a non-breaking change would be when we introduce a new attribute without removing an existing one.
