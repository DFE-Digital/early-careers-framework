<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="notifying-of-schedule-change-non-standard-induction">Non-standard induction</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Following the same principles of those on a standard induction, providers will be paid the equivalent of
  one milestone payment for each of the terms they are supporting a participant. Non-standard schedules will
  not be subject to milestone validation.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Under a non-standard schedule, the API will accept any declarations once the first milestone period for
  the schedule has started. For example, if a participant is on an ecf-extended-september schedule, the API will
  accept any type of declaration, such as a start, retention-1 or completion, from 1 September 2021. Providers
  will still be expected to evidence any declarations and why a participant is following a non-standard induction.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
   We are allowing functionality for providers to switch participants onto the following non-standard schedules:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><code>ecf-extended-september</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-extended-january</code></li>

  <li><code>ecf-replacement-january</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-replacement-april</code></li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
   The non-standard induction schedules are detailed below.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="notifying-of-schedule-extended-schedule">Extended schedule</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">
  For participants that expect to complete their induction over a period greater than two years,
  with the schedule reflecting the month when the participant starts. For example, part time ECTs:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><code>ecf-extended-september</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-extended-january</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-extended-april</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="notifying-of-schedule-reduced-schedule">Reduced schedule</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">
  For participants that expect to complete their induction over a period less than 2 years,
  with the schedule reflecting the month when the participant starts:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><code>ecf-reduced-september</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-reduced-january</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-reduced-april</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="notifying-of-schedule-replacement-mentors">Replacement mentors</h3>
<p class="govuk-body-m">
  For mentors that are replacing a mentor for an ECT that is part way through their training with
  the schedule reflecting the month when the replacement starts:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><code>ecf-replacement-september</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-replacement-january</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-replacement-april</code></li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
Where a mentor is already mentoring an ECT and they replace a mentor for a second ECT, the first ECT
takes precedence. In this instance, the provider should not change the mentor’s schedule.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  The DfE expects that a replacement mentor's training, and therefore any declarations a provider submits
  for them, will align with the ECT they are mentoring. Say a replacement mentor begins mentoring an ECT
  part way through the ECT’s induction. The provider has already submitted a start declaration for the
  previous mentor. Now, the provider makes a retention-1 declaration for the ECT. The department would
  expect that any declaration made for the replacement mentor in the same milestone period as that made for
  the ECT would also be a retention-1 declaration.
