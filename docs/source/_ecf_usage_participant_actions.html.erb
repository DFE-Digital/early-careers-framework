  A usual 2 year induction covers 6 terms (3 in each academic year). The payment model for those following a standard

  <li><code>ecf-standard-september</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-standard-january</code></li>
  <li><code>ecf-standard-april</code></li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Functionality to switch participants onto non-standard inductions will be available at a later date.
  For the time being, please switch participants onto either a September or January schedule based on their start date,
  irrespective of whether they are following a standard or non-standard induction. Detailed below are the standard induction schedules.
