<p class="govuk-body-m">This scenario begins when a participant has been added to the service by registering for an NPQ

  About accepting or rejecting an NPQ application
</h2>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  In order for DfE to understand if a person has been successful throughout these processes, we require you to submit an acceptance or rejection status. This will need to be submitted for each participant you wish to train before starting their NPQ course.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Accepting or rejecting a participant is separate and distinct from a “started declaration”, which will be collected as part of the tracking and payment process. More <a href="#declaring-that-an-npq-participant-has-started-their-course" class="govuk-link">information about declarations</a> can be found further down this page. We will only be able to make payments for participants who are in an “application accepted” state.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Providers should accept a participant if they have been successful in their NPQ application and you wish to enroll them on their chosen NPQ course. Reasons may include but not limited to:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>participant has had their funding confirmed</li>
  <li>participant is suitable for their chosen NPQ course</li>
  <li>participant has the relevant support from their school</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Providers should reject a participant if they have not been successful in their NPQ application. Reasons may include but not limited to:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>participant wishes to go with another provider</li>
  <li>participant wishes to take on another course</li>
  <li>participant no longer wishes to take the course</li>
  <li>participant was not successful in their application process</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Regardless of the outcome of the application you must inform the participant of the outcome of their NPQ application. You may wish to provide them with feedback or ideas about next steps.
</p>

<h3 id="accept-npq-application" class="govuk-heading-m">
  Accept an NPQ application
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  This scenario begins after a participant has been added to the service by registering for an NPQ course
</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="provider-accepts-npq-application">
  1. Provider accepts an NPQ application
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body-m">You can accept someone if they have successfully completed all application steps ahead of starting their course.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  <code>POST /api/v1/npq-applications/{id}/accept</code>
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Where <code>{id}</code> is the <code>id</code> of the corresponding NPQ application. This returns an <a href="/api-reference/reference-v1#schema-npqapplicationresponse" class="govuk-link">NPQ application record</a>.

<h3 id="reject-npq-application" class="govuk-heading-m">

</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="provider-rejects-npq-application">
  1. Provider rejects an NPQ application
</h4>

<p class="govuk-body-m">You will need to reject someone if you will be unable to train them. For example they have failed the rest of their application, have decided against studying an NPQ or are unable to secure funding.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  <code>POST /api/v1/npq-applications/{id}/reject</code>
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  Where <code>{id}</code> is the <code>id</code> of the corresponding NPQ application. This returns an <a href="/api-reference/reference-v1#schema-npqapplicationresponse" class="govuk-link">NPQ application record</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="handling-deferrals" class="govuk-heading-m">
  Handling deferrals
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  If a participant wishes to defer you can accept the participant to show they are enrolled. You should only send the started declaration once the participant has started the course.
</p>

<h3 id="handling-changes-circumstances" class="govuk-heading-m">
  Handling applications with changes in circumstances
</h3>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  There are many possible reasons why there might be a change in circumstances of an application. These may include:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>participant selected incorrect course during their application</li>
  <li>participant made a mistake during their application</li>
  <li>participant now wishes to take another course instead</li>
  <li>participant now wishes to fund their NPQ differently</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body-m">
  If there is a mistake in the application for example where a participant registers for a one NPQ programme but wishes to change to another programme after registration. The provider should reject that participant and ask them to re-register on the NPQ registration service and enter the correct details. Once the new application is available you can then accept.
</p>
