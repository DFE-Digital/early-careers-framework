## Grant funding for training and induction

There are 2 types of grant funding - for training and for induction.

Training grant funding is dedicated only for schools on the FIP programme. This includes:

- Year 1 & 2 lead provider funding

- Backfill mentor funding

Induction grant funding includes:

- Year 1 Core funding

- Year 2 Time off timetable funding, such as 5% off timetable in year 2 of induction and 20 hours of mentor support in year 2 of induction

## Training grant funding

### Year 1 & 2 lead provider funding

#### What does it consist of?

DfE pays Lead Providers to train ECTs and mentors in the full induction
programme. Lead Providers have to give proof that they are in fact
training mentors and ECTs, they do this through 'declarations'.
Declarations are statements of work. They are meant to provide 3
declarations per year, 6 for both years. They do this through the Lead provider API.

#### How are the payments structured?

To manage payments, DfE has ongoing contracts (also called 'call off
contracts') with LPs that cover the 2 years of training a group of ECTs
and mentors receive. In each academic year there is a new 'call off
contract' to cover the new group of participants that comes in. Each new
group of participants is often called a 'cohort'.

There are 3 types of payments to LPs.

##### Service fees
These are fixed. They are an amount that providers will be paid regularly regardless of things like participant numbers. These are a set payment for providing the service. They are paid monthly for a set time. Once passed, statements have £0 service fees.

##### Output fees 
These are flexible. When providers train a participant to a set milestone DfE pays them an output fee. The value of this fee depends on a range of factors. Providers report this via the API (subject to validation) using 'declarations'.

##### Uplift fees
DfE pays an additional 'uplift fee' for participants in specific courses and circumstances e.g. schools with [high pupil premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium) (pupils who are recorded as eligible for free school meals, looked after by a social worker, etc).

#### What is the journey?

Internal DfE staff can access provider financial statements via the finance tool. When a milestone period is hit, DfE staff conduct
assurance and then send out a copy of the financial statement to Lead Providers, along with a CSV of the declarations that make up the statement. Lead Providers check this against what they expected and then invoice DfE. EFSA then makes the payment.
Throughout the process DfE also conducts audits, where they will select a sample of LP data and ask for evidence of training, to reduce the risk of any fraudulent payments.

#### What is the eligibility policy?

All lead providers must declare their subcontracting arrangements (with
delivery partners) for the period 1 August to 31 July through the
[manage your education and skills funding
(MYESF)](https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/) service. Lead Providers
are required to report at least twice a year.

At the start of the period, Lead Providers must:

-   Submit their forecasted delivery on the number of ECTs and mentors
    trained

-   Update their declaration whenever they make any change to their
    Delivery Partners - this includes adding or removing subcontractors
    (delivery partners) or changing the information of a previously
    submitted declaration.

At the end of the period, Lead Providers should submit their actual
delivery.

To do this, Lead Providers will need to know:

-   The names of their subcontractors

-   How much money they will have paid their subcontractor from 1 August
    to 31 July

-   Which funding stream the lead provider is subcontracting

-   The number of learners or apprentices where the training will take
    place

Lead providers who subcontract also need to:

-   Publish their policy for subcontracting delivery on their website

-   Include a link to this policy as part of the subcontractor
    declaration (excluding employer providers who only deliver the
    apprenticeship funding stream)

If DfE does not receive this as part of their declaration, we will
contact LPs to provide the link separately.

If Lead Providers do not subcontract but receive direct funding, they
need to make a 'nil declaration'. 

### Backfill mentor funding

#### What does it consist of?

DfE pays schools to cover the time mentors need to train to be a mentor
during both years of induction. It is paid to the latest school the
mentor has been registered at. This school is responsible for breaking up
the grant and dividing it between previous schools the mentor was at.

#### Types of mentors

-   Replacement mentor. A new mentor joining the ECF mentor
    training programme to replace an existing mentor. These have
    different schedules on CPD. This mentor needs new funding allocated
    to them.

-   Replacing mentor. A mentor who is already on the programme who
    starts to support an ECT (new or existing). This mentor does not
    need new funding as they have already had this allocated.

#### How are the payments structured?

There are 2 payments made to schools at two different moments. If the
mentor has transferred, it is paid to the latest school the mentor has
been registered. This school is responsible for breaking up the grant
and dividing it between previous schools the mentor was at.

To release payment for year 1, the grant funding team needs to do the
following checks:

-   Make sure the mentor's lead provider has a 'start' declaration (the
    declaration that confirms the beginning of training)

-   Make sure the mentor cannot have withdrawn from the DfE-funded
    mentor training as of the date the data cut happens (1 June 2023)

-   An 'instalment 1' payment should not have been paid for that mentor
    previously as well (to prevent double funding)

To release payment for year 2, the grant funding team needs to do the
following checks:

-   Make sure the mentor's Lead Provider has submitted at least one
    'engagement declaration' (either declaration 4, 5 out of 6 or the last completion declaration)

-   The mentor has not previously have been paid for an 'instalment 2'
    payment.

-   Check to see if a 'completion declaration' has been accepted. If it
    has, then this will also trigger an instalment 2 payment.

On top of this, there are certain checks that need to be made for new
(replacement) mentors. If it's a replacement mentor, the grant funding
team need to check if:

-   The mentor they replaced received instalment 1 or 2

-   If the original mentor didn't receive instalment 1, the replacement
    mentor can receive it if they meet the criteria

-   If the original mentor didn't receive instalment 2, the replacement
    mentor can receive it if they meet the criteria

-   If the replacement mentor did receive an instalment, the replacement
    mentor can also receive the same instalment if they are linked to a
    second ECT (to cover for the mentoring of both ECTs).

### What is the eligibility policy for schools?

To be eligible as a school for this type of funding, you need to be:

-   A state-funded school and establishment where induction can be
    served

-   Have a mentor signed up through manage training portal

-   Doing FIP programme

For the mentor to be eligible they need to:

-   Be on a FIP programme

-   Have an active email

- Sign into manage training service and tell DfE their teacher reference
number (TRN) or National Insurance number, name and date of birth

-   Not have any (serious) prohibitions, sanctions or restrictions on
    their record

-   Can't have previously received funding for ECF based mentor training

## Induction grant funding

### Year 1 core funding 

This funding is meant to cover time off an ECT's school timetable to do
induction (10% of their scheduled time). It is provided by the
[Dedicated Schools Grant
(DSG)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authorities-pre-16-schools-funding#dedicated-schools-grant),
calculated using the [national funding formula
(NFF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-for-schools-and-high-needs).
The grant is paid to local authorities, who distribute the payment to
schools, by
[EFSA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/education-and-skills-funding-agency)
(funding institution).

### Year 2 time off timetable funding

#### What does it consist of?

This funding is meant to cover time off an ECT's school timetable to do induction (5% of their scheduled time) and a mentor's time off timetable to support the ECT through induction (20 hours). This funding is for all schools regardless of programme.

To calculate this grant, the funding team need to know which ECTs and mentors are on their second year of induction. However our existing data model was not originally created with this task in mind. Hence we can't rely on induction data, we have to rely on training data, specifically, lead provider declarations as they are the 'cleanest' form of ECT data we have. 

#### How are the payments structured?

The grant funding team need to firstly figure out which ECTs and mentor and in their year 2 of their induction. This is a surprisingly difficult thing to calculate as years doing induction is NOT the same as years doing training. ECTs pause, stop, defer, change schools often and track these changes is at the core of many issues in the data collection system.

#### How they calculate if an ECT is in their second year

For FIP – if they have 4 declarations, we can safely assume they are in their second year of training.

For CIP – CIP don’t have declarations, so instead of trying to get who IS in the 2nd year, they calculate who is NOT – who has NOT completed their first year based on their training registration date.

For DIY – We have to check against DQT, SWO and call ABs directly and ask for ECT details.

Getting this data right is difficult because tracking the movements of an ECT (pause, stop, defer, changing schools) is dependent on AB and SIT updates. There are delays in this data coming through.

Once the data does come through, the data gathered for each programme type is different.

#### What is the eligibility policy?
From a policy standpoint, ECTs need to be the following to be eligible for year 2 time off timetable funding:

* work in one of the schools and establishments serving induction
* hold qualified teacher status (QTS)
* be registered as being in their second year of their induction after 1 September 2021
* schools and establishments who employ ECTs with qualified teacher learning and skills status (QTLS) are not eligible for DfE funding, because they are exempt from statutory induction

## 2024 to 2025 changes to grant funding

#### Backfill mentor funding changes

Previously grant funding team were paying just on a start declaration at the beginning of the term and then the completed declaration at the end of year 2. However, the constant transfers, contract changes, AB changes, etc of mentors were causing a great deal of data errors (specifically 12% payment error, above the KPI mark). 

For this reason, from 2024 backfill mentor payments will be calculated pro rata based on the declarations for each mentor and will be paid to each school individually, instead of only the last school the mentor was placed at. 

For example - Mentor A starts at School A and only does 1 term. Then Mentor A leaves, Mentor B takes over and does mentor training on School A for two more terms. Grant funding will pay School A the three terms in total. However, if Mentor A leaves and no one takes over, grant funding team would only pay the school 1/3 of that payment allowance.

 This data still deeply depends on the declaration data from LPs.

Mentor training will be only 1 year. So backfill mentor grant funding payment will be less (number pending). But, Y2TOT mentor hours will increase, so the ECT will have more mentor hour support.

#### Timing of payments

In 2024 the payments will be done in November instead of August to match up with the time LPs have to (under contract) finalize their declarations
