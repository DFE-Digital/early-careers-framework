## Check data for delivery partners

### Access to the service

Originally, lead providers gave DfE information on all the delivery
partner admin users they thought would require access. For new users,
the delivery partner nominates the users who require access by emailing
support. Support would then raise this as a second line ticket to the
policy and engagement team. The policy team would contact the lead
provider working with this delivery partner to confirm the user was
valid. There is admin functionality where support users can add users to
the delivery partner.

* ðŸ”’ Only approved delivery partner users can be added to view this data.
As the check data service shows personal information for ECTs and
mentors, it would be a GDPR breach to show this to users that do not
require access. Delivery partner users can only access the service who
are covered by the data-sharing agreements between delivery partners and
lead providers.

* ðŸ“œ There were strict directions from policy to define who had access to
this data. This is why it is escalated to policy teams and checked with
the lead provider they work with.

Those users will then receive an email notification that they can sign
in.

* ðŸ’» The email notification is used to alert users they can use the
service.

---

If a delivery partner also acts as an appropriate body, access is given
to each check data service separately.

* ðŸ’» Some delivery partners may be appropriate bodies, but they have
differing responsibilities for each role, and in theory might be
responsible for different ECTs and mentors.

* ðŸ”’ Splitting the responsibility up allows them to see what is relevant
for each role, for those users that require it.

---

### Sign in to the service

The user, if granted access, can try to sign in. This will then send
them a 'magic link' in an email to enable sign in.

 * ðŸ’» Magic link approach was decided to be the best sign in option at the
time.

---

If the delivery partner user is also granted access to the check data
for appropriate bodies service or any other related services, they will
be required to state which role they need to carry out for that session.

* ðŸ’» Some delivery partners may be appropriate bodies, but they have
differing responsibilities for each role, and in theory might be
responsible for different ECTs and mentors.

* ðŸ”’ Splitting the responsibility up allows them to see what is relevant
for each role, for those users that require it.

### View data about the participants linked to their delivery partner

The data that is available to view in the service is the data submitted
by SITs in the Manage ECTs service about ECTs.

* ðŸ™‹ðŸ“Š This was built for delivery partners to help them support schools
better and reduce the data gathered from schools by delivery partners.
It can be used to cross-reference with their own data and information on
ECTs with what schools have submitted in Manage ECTs. There is nothing
they can submit or do to the data, this would have to go via their lead
provider.

* ðŸ“Š Some delivery partners reported it is also the main way they know how
many ECTs they are getting registered with them, and if they're
correctly registered. It was hoped it would reduce workload for
schools.

* ðŸ™‹ Delivery partners also reported it is difficult to support schools with
a limited ability to view the processes and data behind ECF registration
with DFE. Delivery partners may be able to help chase certain tasks for
schools, for example, ABs registering induction data correctly with the
TRA.

#### Data on a participant

-   Full name

-   Email address

-   TRN (Validated against DQT)

-   Role (ECT or mentor)

-   Lead provider (If populated, this is the confirmed DfE-funded
    training provider. If blank, this means the training provider hasn't
    been confirmed or the ECT's school is delivering the DFE-accredited
    materials directly)

-   School

-   School unique reference number (URN)

-   Academic year (The year the participant started their ECF-based
    training)

-   Status (Gives information on if the ECT does not have QTS or has a
    prior induction registered against them in the DQT)

#### Statuses for a participant

-   Contacted for information

-   DfE checking eligibility

-   Not eligible for funded training

-   Checking QTS

-   Training or eligible for training

-   Participant deferred

-   No longer being trained

-   Induction completed

### Filter the data on ECTs/mentors

The user can search for a participant by:

-   Participant name

-   School name

-   TRN

The user can also filter the data shown by:

-   Participant role

-   Academic year

-   Status

* ðŸ™‹ ðŸ“Š These filters were chosen to best meet the needs of delivery
partners. Delivery partner users can filter by status so they can
reconcile their records and see when a change in status has been
received and actioned.

---

### Download the data as a CSV

The data shown on the page is downloaded as a CSV. It remembers the
filters or search that has been applied.

* ðŸ™‹ðŸ“Š This download is used to reconcile delivery partner records with
DfE Manage ECT records, and create communication lists. It was also
hoped it would reduce delivery partners needing to request information
directly from schools, reducing their burden.
