module Induction
  # This service assumes that all transfers are requested by the incoming school for now. There
  # are three paths here:
  #
  # 1) Moving schools but lead provider is same at both schools:
  #
  #   a. Send email to existing lead provider notifying them that an internal
  #      transfer is happening.
  #   b. Send email to participant to notify them.
  #
  # 2) Moving to target schools lead provider and programme:
  #
  #   a. Send email to incoming lead provider.
  #   b. Send email to outgoing lead provider, requesting that they withdraw them.
  #   c. Send email to participant to notify them.
  #
  # 3) Moving to target school, but continuing with current lead provider.
  #
  #   a. Send email to current lead provider, notifying them to expect a new school.
  #   b. Send email to participant to notify them.
