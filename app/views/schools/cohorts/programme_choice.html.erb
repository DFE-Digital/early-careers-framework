    <p>Each induction programme is set up differently. Before you change your programme:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>make sure the <%= govuk_link_to "programme you want to change to", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview" %> works for your school</li>
      <% if @school_cohort.school_chose_fip? %>
        <li>if you have confirmed an agreement with a training provider, you need to speak to them</li>
      <% end %>
      <li>check the following advice on what would change on the service</li>
    </ul>

    <% unless @school_cohort.school_chose_cip? %>
