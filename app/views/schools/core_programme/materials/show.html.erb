<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Changing your materials</h2>
<p>Each set of accredited materials is different. Before you change your materials:</p>
<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
  <li>make sure the materials you want to change to are right for your school</li>
  <li>if your early career teachers and mentors have started their programme, they will lose any progress on the service</li>
</ul>
