<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Choose study materials for your early career teachers</h1>

<p>It’s important to choose the right training materials for your school.</p>

<p>Consider things like:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the style of content that’s likely to work for your teachers and mentors</li>
  <li>which programme structure will best suit your school’s needs</li>
  <li>whether you’d prefer some flexibility or a more prescriptive approach</li>
</ul>

<p>The 4 options all offer theory and practical classroom techniques that:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>cover the early career framework</li>
  <li>are aligned to the teachers’ standards</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see below, they each take a different approach to the way they present their self-study materials.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which programme you want to follow, you can set up accounts for your teachers and mentors to access the self-study materials.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Ambition</h2>
