<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do now</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
  The Early Career Framework covers 8 standards. For every standard there are statements for early career teachers to “learn that” and “learn how to”.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  You need to design training that covers all of these statements.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  You must also ask your appropriate body what evidence you need to supply to demonstrate that your programme is:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>based on the ECF</li>
    <li>meets the statutory requirements</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do before your induction starts</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>make sure your early career teacher has enough time off in their timetable to complete training</li>
  <li>make sure that your induction tutor and mentor have the time to carry out their roles</li>
</ul>
