    <p>Use this service to set up ECF-based training for your early career teachers (ECTs) or tell us about a change at your school.</p>

    <p>You need to tell us:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>how you want to run your training</li>
      <li>which accredited materials or training provider youâ€™ll use</li>
      <li>which ECTs and mentors will take part</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your school must complete these steps before your ECTs can start their statutory induction programme.</p>

    <p>Tell us about any changes, for example, nominating a new Induction tutor.</p>
