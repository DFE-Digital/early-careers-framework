    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>early career teachers (ECTs) in England, due to start ECF-based training as part of their induction</li>
      <li>mentors assigned to support ECTs during induction and ECF-based training</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We need to check your details on the Teaching Regulation Agency records. This is to make sure you’re eligible for DfE funding.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ll ask for your:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>teacher reference number (TRN)</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have a TRN but cannot find it</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can enter your National Insurance number instead. This will help us find and check your TRN.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must <%= govuk_link_to "apply for a TRN", "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn#request-a-trn"
