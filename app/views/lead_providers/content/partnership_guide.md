We’ve created an online service for training providers to:

- upload the schools they have recruited
- check which schools have added their early career teachers and mentors

Our service should help you through each step but here is a quick guide to get you up to speed.

## How to sign in to your account

1. If your organisation has provided us with your name and email address, we will create an account for you.
2. We will send a notification to your email address that your account has been created. You can use this email address to sign in.
3. You do not need a password. When you enter your email address, we send you an automatic email with a link to complete your sign in.
4. Sign in: <https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/users/sign_in>
5. When you have signed in, you will see this page (with your organisation’s name):

<div class="govuk-notification-banner" role="region" aria-labelledby="govuk-notification-banner-title" data-module="govuk-notification-banner">
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__header">
    <h2 class="govuk-notification-banner__title" id="govuk-notification-banner-title">Note</h2>  
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__content">
    <p class="govuk-notification-banner__heading">
      If you go to the start page called ‘Manage training for early career teachers’, ignore the copy for induction tutors. Just press ‘Start’ to get to the sign in page.
    </p>
  </div>

## How to confirm the schools you have recruited

When you have confirmed an agreement with a school or a number of schools, you can upload them using a CSV file. This updates the DfE so that we can process your payments.

1. When you have signed in, select ‘Confirm your schools’.
2. Follow the next screens to ensure that you are only confirming schools for 2021.
3. Choose the delivery partner that these schools will be working with:
   
   ![Example of a Choose the delivery partner page](/lead-provider/choose-delivery-partner-page.png)
   
4. Make sure that your CSV follows this format:
    - one column with the school URNs only (Column A)
    - every school on a new row, no empty rows in between
    - no other delivery partners
    - no other data

Here’s an example CSV:

![Example CSV containing a list of school URNs](/lead-provider/example-csv.png)

<div class="govuk-notification-banner" role="region" aria-labelledby="govuk-notification-banner-title" data-module="govuk-notification-banner">
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__header">
    <h2 class="govuk-notification-banner__title" id="govuk-notification-banner-title">Note</h2>  
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__content">
    <p class="govuk-notification-banner__heading">
      you upload a CSV for each delivery partner you have confirmed schools for.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## Checking errors and updating your CSV
When you upload your CSV, we will show you if there are any errors. These could be:

<dl class="govuk-summary-list">
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">
      Recruited by other provider
    </dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
      Another training provider has confirmed this school
    </dd>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">
      URL is not valid
    </dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
      The unique reference number (URN) does not match this school
    </dd>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">
      Your school - already confirmed
    </dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
      You have already confirmed this school and it’s on your list
    </dd>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">
      School not eligible for inductions
    </dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
      School is not an eligible establishment type and/or isn’t in England and/or isn’t open as per our GIAS snapshot
    </dd>
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-summary-list__row">
    <dt class="govuk-summary-list__key">
      School not eligible for funding
    </dt>
    <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value">
      This school is not eligible to receive funding from the DfE. (Other independent special schools, Welsh establishments, British schools overseas etc.)<br/><br/>
      They can only use the accredited materials (core induction programme).
    </dd>
  </div>
</dl>


You can choose to:

- continue with the schools that do not have any errors, or
- update your CSV and upload it again

When you have confirmed your schools, they will be sent a confirmation email. This includes a link to report if they have been confirmed incorrectly.

## When a school reports that they have been confirmed incorrectly
Every school you confirm on our service will receive a confirmation email like this:

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
<code>&lt;Delivery partner name&gt;</code>, with <code>&lt;Lead provider name&gt;</code>, has confirmed they will be delivering an induction programme to early career teachers at <code>&lt;School name&gt;</code>, starting in 2021.<br/>

<h3>If this is a mistake</h3>

If you have not confirmed an agreement with this provider or you have signed up with someone else, report this now:<br/>
<br/>
<code>&lt;URL&gt;</code><br/>
<br/>
This link will expire in 14 days
</div>

They will also:

- see this notification when they log in to their part of the service
- be reminded to nominate their induction tutor and/or add their ECTs and mentors
- have a link to report if they have been confirmed incorrectly

### When they report this

They must select one of these reasons in our form:

- I have already confirmed an agreement with another provider
- We have not confirmed an agreement
- I do not recognise this training provider
- We do not have any early career teachers this year
- This looks like a mistake

### When they have submitted this form
You and any colleagues using the service will receive an email notification like this:

![Example email notification of a school rejecting a partnership](/lead-provider/email-notification.png)

You will also see this when you are signed into the service.

When you **'Check your schools'**, the label **'Reported error'** will appear next to that school.

![Example school listing page showing a partnership error](/lead-provider/schools-page-with-error.png)

When you click on that school, you will see a banner at the top of the page including the reason they reported this as a mistake:

![Example of a reson being reported](/lead-provider/reported-reason.png)


### If you think the school has made a mistake reporting this

You should contact the school directly (you do not need to contact the DfE) 

if the matter is resolved, upload the school again

<div class="govuk-notification-banner" role="region" aria-labelledby="govuk-notification-banner-title" data-module="govuk-notification-banner">
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__header">
    <h2 class="govuk-notification-banner__title" id="govuk-notification-banner-title">Note</h2>  
  </div>
  <div class="govuk-notification-banner__content">
    <p class="govuk-notification-banner__heading">
      You will not receive payment for this school until resolved and re-uploaded.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## Check the schools you’ve recruited

When you have signed into the service, you can:

- check the schools you have confirmed
- see their details including their induction tutor contact

When you have signed in, select **'Check your schools'**. You’ll see your list of confirmed schools with their ECT and mentor numbers.

![Example showing the page of your schools](/lead-provider/schools-page.png)

You can click on any school to see more details:
