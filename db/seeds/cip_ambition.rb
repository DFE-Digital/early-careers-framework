Welcome to Ambition Institute’s Early Career Teachers programme. This programme has been designed to help teachers early in their career to keep getting better in the most accessible way possible.

## Early Career Teachers

This programme has been designed to bring about lasting change in teachers’ understanding and practice. The programme takes a recurring weekly approach to study and coaching, so teachers and the mentors supporting them can get into powerful routines for improvement. Each week includes:

- Concise, accessible summaries of the evidence, with optional further reading, so teachers can gain understanding quickly.
- Short videos of experts talking through the most important insights, and showing what they look like in practice.
- Mentor sessions that link closely with the summaries and videos, and provide support so they can conduct effective instructional coaching.

We are deeply passionate about helping teachers to keep getting better, using the best and latest evidence of what works.

<h3>Presenter: Peps McCrea</h3>
We all know teachers who are great at fostering good behaviour. Pupils seem to like
them, to work hard in their lessons. Perhaps you can remember a favorite teacher
who neither you, nor your classmates would mess around for. It's tempting to think
that this is down to individual character traits, that good behaviour management
is just something that teachers can just do.  But in fact, helping pupils to behave
in a way that will support them to learn is something that all teachers can learn
to do well. As role models for pupils, we can have a big influence over how they
behave
<h3>Presenter: Nicholas Hickman</h3>
Behaviour for learning involves putting things in place that will enable your pupils
to think hard and try their best. Most effective behavior management strategies are
proactive, rather than reactive. They involve advance planning. They require teachers
to think about what they can do to shape behaviour for the better. To build an effective
learning environment, teachers need to establish and maintain strong routines and
set high expectations for learning. We also need to teach pupils the specific behaviours
that support their learning. And to build strong relationships with pupils, teachers
need to behave in a way that is consistent and make an effort to get to know them.
Get to know the school behaviour policy, greet pupils in the corridors, make positive
phone calls home. All of these things build trust and show that teachers care. Good
behavior management doesn't happen by chance or by magic. It happens as a result
of advanced planning and implementing tried and tested strategies over and over again.
The results will be more than worth the effort.
<h3>Presenter: Peps McCrea</h3>
Over the course of the behaviour strand, we will help you learn how to shape your
pupils’ behaviour, so that enables them to get the best out of school and beyond.
The material's based on a growing body of evidence for both outside and inside the
classroom. In the first half of the strand, we'll show you ways of effectively managing
behavior. We'll show you the value of strong classroom routines, clear expectations,
and trust. In the second half of the strand, we look at how to create a climate for
effective learning by providing structured support, helping pupils to be more receptive
to challenge, and supporting them to think hard.

The strand has been carefully sequenced so that it supports you across the term. At the beginning of the strand, we cover how to set up some of the key routines that you will want to have in place from day one. Towards the end of the strand, we'll explore practices that require more complex behaviour management, such as setting up effective group work. What you learn in the first half of the strand will support you in the second.

Each video will provide you with an overview of the module, practical strategies, and the model of classroom practice to watch and unpick. The videos focus on techniques that you can apply in the classroom and draw on the same research base that is outlined in the evidence summary. We don't want you to just copy what you see in the videos. One example alone can never fit every context. What they can do, however, is give you a concrete example of some of the key ideas that you will learn. When you're watching, pay close attention to the ideas that we highlight. These ideas are transferable across all subjects, phases, and learners. The better you understand these core principles, the more you will be able to adapt what you see to your specific needs.

Over the course of this strand, we want you to learn some practical ways in which you can manage classroom behaviour, as well as some of the theory that underpins these practices. You will come to see that managing behaviour isn't just about stopping disruption and getting pupils to comply. There's a lot more we can do to influence pupil thinking and motivation, which will ultimately help them to learn.

When behaviour's going well, not only do pupils learn more, but it's a much more enjoyable experience for everyone.

## Read | Strand introduction

Welcome to the _Behaviour_ strand of the programme. This strand is composed of 12 modules and has been designed to last roughly a term. It is best completed during your first term as an NQT – typically the autumn term.

By the end of this strand you will have an evidence-informed understanding of:

- How to establish an effective learning environment.
- How to effectively manage behaviour.
- The importance of holding and promoting high expectations for all pupils.

This programme has been designed to ensure that teachers develop a holistic understanding of effective teaching so, while the behaviour strand is mostly about behaviour, it also incorporates insights from instruction and subject.

Furthermore, you’ll notice that as the strand progresses, modules will often touch on previously learned content. This is intentional and a crucial aspect of your learning experience. Some concepts on the programme are so important that they need to be revisited multiple times to ensure you develop a deep and durable understanding.

The strand comprises modules sequenced to first explore the process of establishing an effective learning environment, before considering how to promote behaviours that support effective learning.

- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective behaviour management.
- **Modules 2-5** cover the process of laying the foundations of an effective learning environment.
- **Modules 6-7** cover the process of maintaining an effective learning environment over time.
- **Modules 8-11** explore more complex ideas around certain practices that can support more effective learning, incorporating and building on previous modules.
- **Module 12** explores how teachers continue to improve the learning environment over time.

### Making it work

The features of effective learning environments can vary slightly depending on the subject(s), phase(s) or community you teach. In addition, there are some elements of the learning environment, like the school behaviour policy, that you will have limited control over. This is why it’s important that you work with subject and phase specialists in your school to help you identify the best ways to apply your learning. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to seek assistance and support (for example with challenging behaviour). Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context.

The evidence cited in the strand draws primarily from research on:

- Classroom practices of effective teachers.
- Cognitive science and educational psychology (for example, how pupils learn).
- Evidence on effective educational approaches (both in the UK and internationally).

You might have previously come across some of the terminology explored, however some of the technical language used, particularly around cognitive science, may be new to you. Several key terms are explored further in the evidence summary below.

### A reminder of the programme pattern

Each module in the _Behaviour_ strand follows the pattern below:

- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.
- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.
- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.
- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.

Year one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF.

Now that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.

## B1 | Strand overview

### Teaching challenge

Ms Foden is starting a new year at school. She wants to create an effective learning environment for all of her pupils but worries that she may find it difficult to get some pupils to listen, work independently, or show sufficient respect in the classroom. What does an effective learning environment look like, and where should she start in building one?

### Key idea

Creating a predictable and secure classroom environment, managing pupil behaviour and holding high expectations all contribute to more successful learning.

### Evidence summary

#### The classroom environment and pupil learning

Effective teaching entails improving pupil achievement, in terms of both academic outcomes as well as other outcomes that matter to their future and success (Coe et al., 2014). Improving pupil achievement means generating a lasting change to pupils’ capabilities or understanding. Pupil behaviour, the learning environment and how teachers manage these, all play a critical role in improving pupil learning.

The learning environment or classroom ‘climate’ is a result of multiple factors, such as (Coe et al., 2014):

- Teacher expectations.
- The relationships between teachers and pupils.
- How the teacher manages the classroom.

There is strong evidence that certain teaching approaches lead to better pupil behaviour and create a more effective learning environment (IES, 2008).

The most effective learning environments are those that are predictable and secure, where pupils are responsive to the teacher (IES, 2008), and where pupils feel a sense of connection to their school, peers and teachers. Such classroom environments also contribute to a positive school culture (Chapman et al., 2013). Classroom environments like these are good for all pupils, but particularly those with special educational needs (Carroll et al., 2017).

In general, pupils are more alike than different in terms of how they think and learn (Willingham, 2009), so common approaches are likely to be effective in improving pupil behaviour. But this must be balanced with the need to match teaching and classroom management to individual pupil needs (IES, 2008). Providing additional support can be particularly beneficial to pupils with specific barriers to learning (Carroll et al., 2017).

In addition to improving pupil behaviour, over time effective learning environments can produce a range of important benefits, including:

- **Pupil-teacher relationships:** Positive relationships and pupil perceptions of their teacher are based on repeated interactions over time (Wubbels et al., 2014). Being responsive to pupil needs, including considering and seeking to understand their feelings, can help build strong teacher-pupil relationships.
- **Pupil attitudes to learning:** Pupil perceptions of school are shaped by teacher-pupil interactions and the goals, values and behaviours of classmates (Rathmann et al., 2018).
- **Pupil wellbeing:** Pupils who perceive that their teachers are in control of the class and are able to include them in activities are also more likely to feel satisfied in life and have better school outcomes (Rathmann et al., 2018).
- **Wider outcomes:** In addition to generating high academic outcomes for pupils, effective environments can also improve wider outcomes such as university entrance and graduation rates, higher wages, and lower chances of becoming pregnant as a teenager (Chetty et al., 2014).

#### Effective behaviour management

Part of creating an effective learning environment entails managing pupil behaviour. Effective behaviour management happens best when teachers anticipate challenging pupil behaviours and modify the classroom environment to prevent or mitigate them (IES, 2008). Behaviour management strategies typically fall into one of three categories:

- **Proactive:** Approaches for pre-empting and preventing problem behaviours before they occur. For example, using seating plans.
- **Reactive:** Strategies to deal effectively with classroom behaviours as they arise. For example, using rewards or sanctions.
- **Escalation:** Where proactive and reactive strategies are failing to work after a time, or where behaviour is extremely disruptive or dangerous, teachers should follow the school behaviour policy and/or discuss with their mentor what further support can be put in place. For example, calling parents, setting detentions or sending pupils out of the class after a certain number of sanctions.

Part of effective behaviour management involves setting clear rules and consistently reinforcing them (Coe et al., 2014; IES, 2008). The goal of these rules should be to create an environment where pupils are routinely successful (Coe et al., 2014). In the first half of the Behaviour strand we explore a series of teacher approaches that establish an effective learning environment with good pupil behaviour. Evidence suggests that there are several specific ideas and practices that teachers can use to build an effective learning environment and manage pupil behaviour. These include:

|                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Time on task           | While pupil behaviour is not a perfect indicator of whether pupils are learning (Coe, 2013), there is a significant relationship between the amount of time pupils spend on task and how much they learn (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Peer Effects           | Pupil behaviour is influenced by that of their peers (IES, 2008). The more that individual pupils adopt on-task behaviours, the more likely it is that other pupils will follow them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Positive reinforcement | Positive reinforcement can create an effective learning environment. Positive reinforcement entails providing acknowledgement, praise and rewards for positive behaviours. However, teachers must be careful not to overuse praise, as this can inadvertently communicate low expectations (Coe et al, 2014). To avoid this, teachers can use ‘acknowledgement’ when expectations are merely met and reserve ‘praise’ for when they are exceeded. Sanctions for negative behaviours can also be used alongside positive reinforcement. Providing more praise than reprimand has been found to be most effective (IES, 2008).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Pupil success          | Ensuring a high pupil success rate is a powerful way to foster pupil behaviour and learning (Rosenshine, 2012). How Ms Foden communicates her expectations of pupil success can influence what they do and achieve. For example, if she inadvertently communicates low expectations of success, pupils can start to think that they can’t do it (Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010) and reduce the amount of effort they put in (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Conversely, pupils’ prior experiences of success at a specific, appropriately challenging, task makes it more likely they will be motivated to persist at similar tasks in the future; this also makes it more likely they will be successful at such tasks (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Ms Foden should balance challenge with high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012)                                                                                                                            |
| Motivation             | Pupil motivation can be intrinsic (driven by the task itself) or extrinsic (driven by rewards and sanctions). Pupils who are motivated intrinsically are more likely to stay on task longer and persist when learning gets challenging (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016). Over time, Ms Foden should aim to reduce extrinsic motivators and increase pupil intrinsic motivation. For example, helping pupils to master challenging content, and make links between their long term-goals and the work they are doing in school, can help pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, as well as pupil behaviour and academic success (EEF, 2018). Ms Foden should use opportunities like parents evening to communicate proactively and engage parents and carers in their children’s schooling. |
| Self-regulation        | Self-regulation – the ability to steer our own behaviour and learning – is a strong predictor of attainment and future success. A key aspect of this is emotional regulation (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). This is important because negative pupil emotions can lead to pupils avoiding a task (Kluger & DeNisi 1996) and also because the ability to regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future life (EEF, 2017). Effective self-regulation also requires pupils to develop metacognitive strategies – how they plan, monitor and evaluate their approaches to specific tasks. Teacher support for pupil metacognition is likely to increase pupil self-regulation, success and therefore motivation (EEF, 2017).                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Behaviour that fosters effective learning

In the second half of the Behaviour strand, we will explore ways that teachers can foster effective learning. This part of the strand has lots of connections with the Instruction strand. Evidence suggests that there are several specific ideas and practices that teachers can use to generate behaviours that further foster effective learning in the classroom. These include:

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guided instruction | Pupils learn best when they build on what they already know, and when teachers guide them clearly and directly towards what they need to know – an approach sometimes referred to as ‘explicit instruction’ (Coe et al., 2014). This is in contrast to less guided instruction, where pupils are left to ‘join the dots’ or discover things themselves. Once a teacher has established their classroom expectations, maintaining good pupil behaviour while adding to their teaching repertoire requires effective instruction. There are links with the Instruction strand later in behaviour. |
| Practice           | Getting pupils to think about and practise expected behaviours, by guiding them and reinforcing desirable behaviours, can foster positive changes in pupil behaviour change over time (IES, 2008). Guided practice can develop pupil metacognition linked to specific tasks, and practice can also develop pupils’ capacity to self-regulate their emotions, which can support pupils to be more successful and independent over time (EEF, 2017).                                                                                                                                              |

Holding high expectations is one particularly important yet hard-to-pin-down part of creating an effective learning environment. When we talk about teacher expectations we mean: the beliefs that teachers hold and the messages that they communicate regarding what their pupils are capable of, both in terms of behaviour and learning. In turn, this influences the levels of classroom challenge and support that teachers provide (Coe et al., 2014). Inadvertently communicating low expectations can lead to a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, where pupils behave and learn in line with what the teacher expects rather than what they are capable of (Murdock-Perriera et al., 2018; Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010).

#### Nuances and caveats

Behaviour is only one piece of the effective teaching puzzle. Effective instruction and sound teacher subject knowledge are also critical (Coe et al., 2014). And perhaps most importantly, these different dimensions of effective teaching influence each other – it is only when they are aligned that effective teaching can flourish (IES, 2008).

So, while Ms Foden must work hard to develop her understanding and approach around behaviour, she must also recognise that this needs to go hand-in-hand with things like providing the right balance of challenge and support for helping her pupils to experience regular success in the classroom. It is little wonder that becoming a great teacher takes time and continued learning.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Good routines can really help both teachers and pupils. When they're in place, classrooms
work better, and everyone has more time for learning. And when teachers set up routines,
they have a great opportunity to build a culture and environment that will help their
pupils to learn. So routines are a brilliant place to start.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
We know that the environment in which pupils learn can have a big impact on the quality
of their learning. All pupils thrive in an environment where they feel safe and secure,
and predictability can help with this. A predictable and secure environment can be
particularly valuable for pupils with SEND.

Predictable doesn't mean boring or unstimulating. Quite the opposite. A predictable environment can provide the structure and security that enables pupils to do a wide range of activities such as playing, asking questions and thinking deeply. All of these can benefit learning.

Teachers can use routines to build a secure environment. Where there are good routines in place, pupils know what they should and shouldn't do, which helps them to succeed. It also tends to reduce negative behaviour. And when everyone sticks to the routines, the classroom can feel predictable and safe.

Good routines also free up more time for learning. We knew that doing the same thing over time can help us to become more fluent in it. And once we do something fluently, it means we are drawing on information in our long-term memory, which frees up space in our working memory. This should help pupils to pay attention to what they're learning.

In order to establish routines, teachers need to plan, teach, and constantly reinforce routines with their pupils.

In the first instance, teachers need to think carefully about the most important routines that they need and then plan how they will establish them. Typical classroom routines include how pupils enter and exit the classroom, how materials are handed out, how pupils move from one space in the room to another, how they respond to questions, and the routines for paired and group talk. These are things that pupils do all the time, so it's worth creating a routine for them. When planning a routine, it's useful to consider what the pupils should be doing, what resources they might need, and what the teacher should be doing.

Once teachers have thought through their routines, they need to explicitly teach them to pupils and get all their pupils to practice and repeat them. When doing so, it is important that their instructions are specific, sequential and manageable.

You might also discuss why the routine is there and how it can help pupils to achieve important classroom values.

And when a routine is in place, teachers need to help it stay in place by clearly reminding pupils of what they need to do. Positive reinforcement is a great way to communicate the shared values that improve classroom and school culture. For example, teachers might reinforce the entry routine by thanking a pupil who walks into the classroom calmly or acknowledge a pupil who gets started with their work straight away. We can't assume that pupils will know what this culture is. As key role models, teachers have to tell them and show them.

All of this may take time to get right, and you may need to revisit routines across the year, but it is time and energy that is well worth investing in. Great classroom routines help to create a space where all pupils can learn.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>A key routine that teachers might want
to think about is how their pupils will enter their classroom. In a moment, we are
going to look at an entry routine. As you watch, pay particular attention to the
following:
<ul>
  <li>Explicitly tell pupils what they are expected to do</li>
  <li>Positively reinforce the routine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
The way that pupils enter the classroom can have a big impact on the start of
the lesson. We want to help them enter calmly and focus their attention on what
they're about to learn. Imagine that I'm teaching a year four class. I've
collected them from the playground after break, and they are lined up waiting to
enter the classroom. When they enter, there is an activity asking them to
complete punctuation errors in simple sentences. This is something that they
have practiced before, and I know that my pupils can all access the learning on
their own. I've previously taught the class how I want them to enter the
classroom, and they've practiced this. Now they're doing it well, I want to
reinforce our entry routine so it really sticks. Before the lesson, I quickly
scripted what I want to say to make sure that my instructions are really clear.

<em>
  “Good morning year four, it's lovely to see you all lined up so silently. So
  when we come into the classroom today, remember you're going to move straight
  to your desk, begin the starter task in silence. Okay, first 10, in you come.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher gestures to pupils to walk in. Teacher is intentionally looking at
  pupils lining up in the corridor and watching them as they enter the
  classroom]
</em>

<em>
  Morning, Arfan. Morning Artek, morning Chante. I can see Arfan's already
  started the task in silence, thank you. Morning, Lily. So has Chante. Thank
  you.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher notices that one pupil is not doing the starter activity so looks at
  them and then points at the instructions on the white board].
</em>

<em>Everyone moving nice and silently, thank you.”</em>

So let's unpick the model. To begin with, I set clear expectations. I told them to come in, to move to their seats, and then begin the starter activity in silence. I then reiterated these instructions as the first couple of students entered. My pupils are familiar with this routine, but it's still important to remind them of each step, in detail. First, they enter the classroom in silence. Then they sit at their seat and begin the starter activity. My instructions were specific and sequential, which helped pupils to follow them.

I used positive reinforcement to help maintain the routine. As soon as I noticed pupils who were doing what I expected, I pointed this out. Arfan has made a start. Again, even when pupils are confident with the routine, positive reinforcement helps to keep it in place.

You might also have noticed that I gave a non-verbal reminder. At one point in the routine, I noticed that one of my pupils hadn't started to work as I'd asked. I looked at the pupil, then pointed at the instructions on the whiteboard. This quick, non-verbal reminder was enough to get the pupil back on track and it didn't distract me or the other pupils. I was able to see this behaviour because I was standing in a position where I could see both into the classroom and the pupils as they entered, and I was constantly checking both.

Finally, I created a culture where trust and respect are important by greeting each pupil in the same polite, warm, and friendly manner. In doing so, I'm welcoming each pupil into the classroom and establishing a positive tone for the lesson. I want my pupils to be polite, so it's essential that I model this to every single one of them. And I also want them to begin the lesson with a positive interaction.

Overall, my instructions help pupils follow the routine and get started quickly.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we've thought about the rule that routines play in the classroom,
identified the key features of a good routine, and looked at an example that demonstrates
these. Before we finish, take a moment to read through the key features of effective
routines. Which of these ideas do you currently recognize from your school setting?
<ul>
  <li>Explicitly teach routine and behavioural expectations</li>
  <li>Practise routines</li>
  <li>Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions</li>
  <li>
    Use consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom
    directions

## Teaching challenge

Mr Price wants to have a classroom where pupils enter quietly and begin their learning promptly. However, only about half of his pupils are starting the lesson in this way. Some pupils are taking up to ten minutes to settle and are slow to start tasks during the early part of the lesson. What might Mr Price do to tackle this challenge?

## Key idea

Establishing and maintaining routines can increase both the amount of time that pupils spend learning, and the quality of that learning.

## Evidence summary

### The power of routines

Routines are just any aspect of the classroom that have a repeating and familiar pattern. There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that establishing and maintaining routines leads to positive, predictable and motivating classrooms (Kern & Clemens, 2007).

When pupils are able to predict the events that happen during their school day, they are more likely to be engaged and less likely to exhibit undesirable behaviours. Routines are great ways to increase the predictability of the classroom, particularly at the start of the school year.

Aspects of the lesson that are ripe for building strong routines include:

- How pupils enter the classroom and start the lesson.
- How pupils finish the lesson and exit the classroom.
- What pupils do when they complete activities or get stuck.
- How pupils engage in classroom discussion.

### Setting expectations

To set up routines in ways that work and last, teachers need to communicate and reinforce expectations of what should happen. If pupils are not clear about what they are expected to do, routines are unlikely to take hold and remain.

Research has demonstrated that the higher the expectations that teachers have of their pupils, the better the behaviour will end up being. And if multiple teachers are able to set and maintain expectations, then behaviour will be better across the school as a whole (Kern & Clemens, 2007). Mr Price should recognise his responsibilities as part of a wider system of behaviour management, but also understand that he has the right to support and training from senior colleagues.

Communicating expectations around routines are most effective when they are:

- **Concise:** Communicate the routine using a few clear steps. Complexity can be added as routines get embedded.
- **Positively framed:** Say what you want pupils to do rather than what you don’t want them to do.
- **Modelled:** Regularly show your pupils what you want them to do, particularly when you are in the early stages of establishing a routine.

### **Getting routines to stick**

As well as setting clear expectations for a routine, we also have to think carefully about how we make that routine last. Routines will simply dissipate as pupils forget and other things interfere, unless we take intentional steps to make them stick. To maintain routines, we can (IES, 2008):

- **Revise:** Continually repeat our expectations of what we think the routine should be like and why, even after pupils have ‘got it’.
- **Re-practise:** Keep getting pupils to do the routine. In the early days, you can even get them to do a ‘rehearsal’ or two.
- **Reinforce:** Use the school behaviour system (e.g. praise, rewards and sanctions) to help pupils keep to the routine. To be effective, reinforcement should be mostly positive and consistently applied.

When routines are established, not only do they create more time and a better environment for learning, but they can help teachers see and deal with undesirable behaviour as soon as it arises. Routines create predictable patterns of classroom activity and so make it easy to spot when behaviour deviates from what is expected. Catching and correcting challenging behaviour early can make pupils feel safer and creates a warmer classroom environment where learning is more likely to occur (Kern & Clemens, 2007).

### Nuances and caveats

Is it realistic for Mr Price to expect all the pupils he teaches to meet his high expectations and adopt routines? Research suggests that clear expectations and predictable consequences are beneficial to both pupils with and without special educational needs, and especially useful for younger pupils (DfE, 2017; Gathercole et al., 2006).

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Mr Price can use routines to establish positive behaviour for learning by understanding
that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Routines can create a positive and motivating climate in the classroom.
  </li>
  <li>
    High expectations can improve pupil behaviour at both a classroom and school
    level.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
We want to give all pupils the best chance of success in their learning. Teachers
need to give clear instructions so that pupils know what to do and how to do it.
Good instructions can also help to create an effective environment and improve pupil
behaviour. When teachers give instructions, they have the chance to explicitly state
their expectations so that everybody can meet them. We can achieve a lot with a few
well-planned words.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
The moments when a teacher sets out the activity instructions matter a lot. Good
instructions can increase desirable behaviour and help pupils to get on with the
tasks and activities set. So teachers need to plan their instructions carefully.

Firstly, you need to think about what you will say. Provide manageable, individual steps and specifically point out what pupils should do. And try to keep instructions short. Cut out redundant words. In an EYFS setting, for example, you might say, first, <em>“let's stand up with two feet on your bug spot”</em>, instead of a more long-winded version like, <em>“first I want everyone to stand up and stand right on your bug spot so that we can get ready to move back to our seats.”</em> We can only think about a few things at once, so it's important to limit the number of steps or words in our instructions. Focus on what matters the most.

Ordering steps sequentially also helps pupils to follow them. For example, <em>“first you need to highlight a key phrase, then you need to label what it means.” </em> Another approach is to tell pupils what to do with their mouth, their body and their brain. For example, you might ask pupils to <em>“work in silence on your own and order the fractions from smallest to largest.”</em> This format won't be appropriate in all instances, but where it is, it can help both pupils and teachers remember what to do.

Visual supports can also help pupils to understand instructions. For example, you might want to add a recognizable hand gesture for activities that pupils are familiar with. And you might also wish to include a list of written instructions to accompany your verbal instructions so that pupils can refer back to them.

As well as thinking about what to say, you need to think about how you will say it. Think about how you're standing and your tone of voice. You need to make it clear that what you're saying is important and that pupils should pay attention to it. Teachers need to stand at a spot where they can see all pupils and they need to stand still. This allows both teacher and pupil to focus on the content of the instruction. As for voice, it's good to speak in a formal tone when delivering instructions.

It's easy to overlook the importance of instructions. Teachers spend lots of time thinking about what pupils will learn and designing a great task, but can sometimes forget to plan how they will explain it to pupils. There's a risk that this planning time will go to waste because pupils won't know how to get on with the task. It's worth scripting out what you will say and practicing it. The more you do this, the quicker you will get at it, and the more effective your instructions will be.

When pupils have a good understanding of how to do something, they're much more likely to give it a go.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In a moment, you're going to watch a model of how to deliver effective task instructions.
As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Provide manageable, specific and sequential instructions</li>
  <li>Use voice and body to ensure pupils pay attention</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year three class who
are working hard on an independent writing task. I'm going to gain their
attention and give instructions for what to do next.

<em>
  “Pens down, hands on desks and eyes on me in three, two, and one. Thank you.{" "}
</em>

<em>Okay, I need you to listen really carefully for what to do next. </em>

<em>
  One, put your book in your folder. Two, put your folder in the middle of your
  table. Make sure they are facing up. Three, put your hands on your desks and
  look at me so that I know you are ready.{" "}
</em>

<em>I need you to do all of this without speaking.</em>

<em>Okay. Mohammed, where do you need to put your book? </em>

<em>And Stewart, where are you going to put your folder? </em>

<em>And Ashley, how are you showing me you are ready? </em>

<em>Thank you. Okay, 30 seconds, off you go.”</em>

In this model, I made sure that my instructions were manageable by breaking down the task into three small steps. I was really specific, telling them precisely where to place their books and their folders. And I presented the steps in a sequential order. First, they put their books in their folder. Then they put the folder in the middle of their tables. I also included non-verbal signals. For example, placing the books in the folder, to help draw attention to this step.

I used consistent language. <em>“Pens down, hands on desks” </em>is a phrase that I repeat throughout my lessons, which helps it to stick.

As I spoke to the pupils, I used a formal tone of voice. I use this tone of voice for instructions because I want to signal the what I'm saying is important. It encourages the pupils to pay attention.

Overall, the instruction had clarity, both in terms of content and delivery. All of this together helps my pupils to know precisely what I'm asking them to do, making it more likely that they will be successful.

## Teaching challenge

For Ms Silva, the most challenging pupil behaviour occurs during ‘transition’ parts of her lessons - for example, when she moves from giving an exposition to asking her pupils to do some independent work. At these times they often take a while to settle, and sometimes even do the wrong things. She also finds herself having to repeat her instructions multiple times which can take up valuable learning time. How can Ms Silva best manage these transitions to help her pupils get on with their learning quickly and independently?

## Key idea

Setting high expectations and providing clear instructions are powerful ways to foster good behaviour and create an effective learning environment.

## Evidence summary

### **Teacher expectations matter**

Setting and communicating clear expectations has a strong influence on pupil behaviour (Murdock-Perreira & Sedlacek, 2018). For example, conveying low expectations can generate a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ where pupils end up behaving according to the expectations we have set, rather than what they are capable of (Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010). Sometimes teachers can communicate low expectations without realising. This can happen when we ask certain pupils more questions than others, or when we permit pupils to call out when they shouldn’t.

To mitigate this, Ms Silva should be intentional about holding and communicating high expectations for her pupils. This means:

- Continually assuming that all her pupils are capable of behaving well and making progress in their learning.
- Relentlessly communicating to pupils that she knows they are capable and that she expects nothing less than exemplary behaviour and learning from them.
- Regularly providing clarity to her class about the kind of classroom culture that she values.

### Clear instructions can make a huge difference

Giving instructions is a great opportunity to embed high expectations into your lesson. Delivering instructions effectively can help make lesson transitions go smoothly and foster a purposeful and effective learning environment (IES, 2008). Effective instructions can reduce challenging behaviour, reinforce desirable behaviour, and make the classroom more structured and predictable for pupils (Kern & Clemens, 2007). For example, directing pupils to sit in a seating plan and giving them clear instructions for how to begin the starter activity increases the chances of an orderly entrance and successful start to the lesson.

Instructions are powerful because they act as a reference point that pupils use as a guide for what to do and how to do it. However, giving effective instructions is not always easy to do well. In particular, there are two features of how pupils think that can thwart our efforts:

1. **Limited working memory:** People can only think about so many things at once. If we give our pupils too many instructions to hold in their heads, it is likely that they will be unable to retain any of them.
2. **Forgetting:** People forget things. This is especially true when instructions are overly lengthy or for unfamiliar classroom activities (Gathercole et al., 2006).

Both of these situations are exacerbated by the mental demands of the classroom. During our lessons, we often ask pupils to both hold instructions in their heads and think hard about lesson content - for example, when we expect pupils to remember our instructions for conducting a paired discussion while also considering complex questions about Caesar’s invasion of Britain. To make it feasible for our pupils to meet high expectations, we must make sure our instructions are easy to understand and put into practice.

### Issuing effective instructions

Bearing in mind the above features of how pupils think, classroom instructions are likely to be more effective when they are:

- **Stepped:** The best instructions are broken down into a clear sequence of manageable steps (Gathercole et al., 2006).
- **Brief:** They include as few steps as possible and get straight to the point, especially when giving instructions for new or unfamiliar activities. If you are struggling to achieve a low number of steps, it may be worth looking at making the task itself less complex.
- **Visible:** Displaying instructions in addition to communicating them verbally means that pupils won’t have to remember them while also thinking about the lesson content.
- **Checked:** Pupils can easily misunderstand initial instructions. Checking that pupils have understood the steps before letting them get on with the task can increase the chances that they do the right thing (Rosenshine, 2012). This also increases the chances of them remembering the instructions.
- **Supported:** Consistent language and non-verbal actions for common classroom directions also make them more likely to be memorable.

### Nuances and caveats

It is important to think about how we communicate instructions. Timing, tone of voice and how we model instructions can all make a difference to how well they are taken on board. Providing clear instructions is beneficial to all pupils but it can be especially important for younger pupils, those with Special Educational Needs and those with lower working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006).

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
To see a class of pupils engaged in a meaningful task thinking hard is really encouraging.
The potential for learning is huge and it's a brilliant sight. But behind this picture
lies a lot of careful work and effort. It doesn't just happen by accident. Once teachers
have set up a task successfully, they need to help their pupils stay on task. There
are simple but powerful strategies that teachers can use to direct attention and
help their pupils be at their best.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
We need to pay attention to something in order to learn it, and yet, paying attention
isn't always easy. It may be that the content is unfamiliar. Most people will struggle
to keep hold of information when they know very little about it. It can be harder
to pay attention to something that you don't feel you're good at. Competing distractions
can get in the way, someone whispering behind you. Some pupils with SEND may find
it hard to pay attention at times. But whilst paying attention can be difficult,
the good news is we can help.

There are several strategies that teachers can use to help their pupils pay attention to learning. Teachers can establish a classroom environment that is an effective place for all pupils to learn. Having good systems in place is important, such as where pupils store their materials. Depending on the individual needs of pupils, teachers may want to put additional supports in place to help pupils focus on their learning. For example, if you have a pupil with a hearing impairment, you should identify the most appropriate seat for that pupil. It is important to discuss this with the pupil, their parent or carer, and the specialist staff in the school.

As well as shaping the classroom environment, teachers also need to think carefully about what they do within the classroom environment to helps pupils pay attention. Giving manageable and specific instructions helps. These instructions should clearly tell pupils what they should be doing and how, such as <em>“complete the number sentence in silence”</em>. It can also help pupils by focusing their attention on the most important aspects of a task: <em>“remember to include the equal sign”</em>.

Another strategy is to draw attention to the sorts of positive behaviours that are likely to enable pupils to succeed. Teachers can do this by identifying the positive behaviours that they want to see in advance, explicitly naming the behaviour that will help, and then pointing it out when it occurs. For example, when setting pupils up in a group task, the teacher might identify that one pupil should take notes during the task, name this by saying, when one person is talking, the other person needs to make brief notes about their most important points. And then point it out when they see it: <em>“great, Gabriel is making some really useful notes.”</em> Explicitly naming behaviours can be especially helpful for some pupils with SEND.

During an activity, teachers can reinforce positive behaviours by looking out for them and describing what they see. A teacher might say, <em>“Toby has got started on the task straightaway”</em>, or, <em>“Fatima is making sure she is pausing to read her writing as she goes.” </em>It doesn't need to be a constant duration. If a pupil is purposefully engaged in an activity, then intervening with a narration about their behaviour might be a distraction. However, a brief and carefully timed positive reinforcement can be really powerful.

In order to reinforce positive behaviours, teachers need to actively look for them. This means standing in a position where teachers can see all pupils and proactively scanning the classroom. Pointing out the positive behaviours of someone pupils can encourage others to do the same.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to direct pupil attention. As you
watch, pay particular attention to the following.
<ul>
  <li>Rigorously maintaining expectations</li>
  <li>Using positive reinforcement to keep pupils on track</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
Positive reinforcement is a great way of helping pupils to meet your
expectations. For the purposes of this model, I'm an RE teacher with a class of
year eight pupils. It is the end of the lesson, and I'm getting my pupils ready
to leave. After I have given my instructions, I'm going to look out for positive
behaviours.

<em>“In three, two, one, looking at me. </em>

<em>
  When I say go, I want you to open your books to today's work and put them at
  the back of your desk, I want you to pack the remaining things into your bag,
  and I would like you to stand behind your chair with the chair tucked in
  showing me that you're ready.{" "}
</em>

<em>Off you go. </em>

<em>
  The front row have got their books open at the back of their desk, well done.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  The middle row have packed away the rest of their things Anna is already
  standing behind her chair showing me that she's ready. Well done, Anna.”
</em>

Let's unpack this example. First, consider my position in the classroom. You will notice that I was standing where I can clearly see all of my pupils. If I'm going to spot positive behaviour, I need to be able to see it. I also want my pupils to know what I'm looking out for. So I was surveying the classroom in a slightly exaggerated way, craning my neck like this. Having set up my expectations in the instructions, I'm making it really clear to pupils that I expect them to be maintained.

My instructions were specific, sequential and manageable. I set out precisely what pupils needed to do in the order that they needed to do it. And I tried to keep my instructions short. As pupils become more familiar with the routine, I may be able to replace words with non-verbal gestures, but at this point, I still need to support pupils by explicitly stating what they should do.

Notice that I gave a short pause between the countdown and giving my instructions. I want to make sure that all pupils are listening.

Another important aspect of this model is that I narrated the positive behaviours that my pupils carried out. I used neutral, descriptive language and kept it short. I hope that by doing this, it will provide another opportunity for pupils in the classroom to know what they should be doing.

Now that you have seen a clear model of how to direct attention, read through the
key ideas that we have covered in this video. Which of these ideas do you think that
the example illustrated best?

  <li>Teach and rigorously maintain clear behavioural instructions</li>
  <li>Monitor these values with gaze</li>
  <li>Vocalise positive examples of these expectations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
There are lots of ways in which teachers can support their pupils to pay
attention to learning. And this is a really important part of our role. Choose
one thing to practice and practice doing it well. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Ms Silva knows what she wants her pupils to do and communicates it clearly. However, during her expositions or when pupils are working independently, she finds that some pupils simply drift off and stop paying attention to her or the task. What could she do to keep her pupils focused for more of the lesson?

## Key idea

Attention naturally drifts and so teachers need to continuously monitor and actively direct pupil attention to maintain a classroom where all pupils succeed.

## Evidence summary

### Attention wanders

Ms Silva has high expectations of her pupils. She regularly communicates these and keeps her instructions clear and concise to help pupils meet these expectations (Gathercole et al., 2016). However, even this does not guarantee that her pupils will continue to pay attention throughout the lesson.

It is natural for the mind to wander after a time, particularly in busy environments such as the classroom (Sweller et al., 1998). Attention is also influenced by pupil motivation. For example, where pupils believe they may be unsuccessful, they can end up avoiding a task, while prior experiences of success make them more likely to persist at similar tasks (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).

Whatever the reason, Ms Silva needs to recognise that pupil attention wanders, so this is something she needs to take responsibility for and direct as needed to keep her pupils learning.

### Directing pupil attention

A variety of strategies can be used to direct pupil attention. These include:

- **Modelling:** Showing pupils exactly what paying attention looks like.
- **Reinforcing:** Acknowledging or praising pupils who are demonstrating good levels of focus, being specific about what they are doing to earn this recognition.
- **Positively framing:** Saying what you want to see from pupils rather than what you don’t want to see.

One useful distinction here is to appreciate the difference between praise and acknowledgement. Praise entails rewarding a behaviour that exceeds expectations, whereas acknowledgement entails showing that you have noticed a behaviour that meets expectations. Over-praising pupils who are merely following standard rules can inadvertently convey low expectations and hamper learning (Coe et al., 2014).

Pupil capacity to self-regulate their emotions and behaviour influences how well they can direct their attention towards specific tasks. No-one is able to completely self-regulate their attention at all times, and this ability varies between individuals. But self-regulation can be developed, improving pupils’ abilities to learn effectively (EEF, 2017). In addition, our behaviour is influenced by that of our peers. The more pupils that are paying attention, the more others will be encouraged to do so (IES, 2008). Effective teachers take account of these factors to help their pupils focus by using, for example:

- **Brief reminders:** Issuing a quick reminder of what is expected, using consistent language and non-verbal signals. “We’re just waiting for one more person to face the front in silence, thank you.”
- **Private reminders:** Having subtle conversations with individuals when it is only a few who need support to stay focused. “Hi Jenny, let me know if there is anything you need to help you get started.”
- **Benefit of the doubt:** Communicating a belief that off-task behaviour is a result of enthusiasm for learning rather than purposeful disruption. “I know you are really keen to discuss this task with your partner but, to do a good job of it, first you need to put your pens down and face me.”

### Pupil perceptions matter

Pupils tend to have a more positive classroom experience when they feel that their teacher is effective at managing the attention and behaviour of the class. This is important because pupils who have positive classroom experiences are more likely to feel wider life satisfaction and get better results. Pupils see effective teachers as those who (Rathmann et al., 2018):

- Are aware of everything in class, instantly noticing when pupils aren’t paying attention.
- Manage to quickly re-involve pupils if they don’t pay attention for a moment.
- Have the class under control.

Therefore, as well as directing pupil attention, effective teachers might choose to be highly visible in how they do it. Being seen to actively monitor the room, direct attention and control the lesson can help pupils to feel that they are in a safe environment and pay even more attention.

### Change takes time

Explaining a classroom routine just once or delivering a set of instructions without follow up is rarely enough to create lasting classroom change. For high expectations to become embedded, teachers need to continually remind and reinforce (IES, 2008).

Reinforcement is more effective when it acknowledges positive behaviour more often than highlighting negative behaviour. Over time, this approach has been shown to increase academic engagement and focus (IES, 2008).

### Nuances and caveats

Acknowledgement, praise and reminders are powerful teaching tools for directing attention. However, there are also times when teachers simply need to issue a sanction or escalate the issue in line with the school behaviour policy. For example, when pupils are being defiant, inhibiting learning or risking the safety of others (IES, 2008).

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Ms Silva can direct pupil attention and increase learning by understanding that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Self-regulation and pupil motivation can affect how pupils direct their
    attention, which naturally wanders over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Proactively monitoring, modelling and reinforcing helps direct pupil
    attention and keep them on task.
  </li>
  <li>
    When reinforcement is positively framed it makes pupils feel safe and
    creates a more productive learning environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teachers can redirect attention in the least intrusive ways. But if action
    taken by the teacher is sometimes clearly visible, pupils can feel that
    their teacher is more effective and experience a stronger sense of shared
    classroom values.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Low level disruption refers to relatively small but persistent distractions that
many teachers will come across. Pupils talking when the teacher is, refusing to work
with a talk partner, prodding a pupil when sitting on the carpet. These are distractions
that can get in the way of learning, particularly during teacher led instruction.
This is different, of course, from interactions that occur when pupil are involved
in meaningful activity, such as child initiated play. It may be tempted to ignore
low level disruption, but it can reduce both the amount and quality of thought that
pupils give to their work. So teachers need to find ways of reducing low level disruption
and supporting all pupils to stay on task.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
When teachers respond quickly to low level disruption, they send a clear message
to their pupils that they have high expectations of them all. They show that they
want to create the most effective learning environment possible, one in which all
pupils have the opportunity to think, learn and grow. So what can teachers do? We
might divide our approach in two. There are proactive strategies and reactive strategies.

Proactive strategies are things that teachers can do to prevent low level disruption. Reactive strategies are ways to respond when it occurs.

Proactive strategies include things like clear routines and instructions, naming the positive behaviour that will help learning, and acknowledging positive behaviour when it occurs. Reactive strategies pausing mid-sentence if a pupil is talking when a teacher is, reminding pupils of expectations or addressing an individual directly. For example, in an EYFS setting where child is playing with another child's chair on the carpet, you might quickly say the pupil's name and state what they should do: <em>“Theo, looking at the picture.”</em> These are all least intrusive responses which teachers can deliver quickly without drawing too much attention to the disruption. There may be times when this won't be enough, such as when bullying or behaviour threatens emotional safety. Teachers need to choose a response that is appropriate to the behaviour.

If a pupil is talking when the teacher is, the teacher can pause, wait until the pupil has stopped and then continue. When pupils haven't followed the instructions that a teacher has given, it can be helpful for teachers to quickly and clearly restate or remind them of their expectations. Restating expectations can be helpful if a pupil hasn't understood them. Reminding pupils helps if they forgot. Regular opportunities to follow instructions benefit all pupils.

Sometimes addressing an individual pupil directly with a concise reminder will be most appropriate: <em>“Kaley, facing me.”</em> Pupils often respond positively when they know that a teacher has addressed low level disruption. It can help to build a culture of mutual trust.

It's important that teachers respond to low level disruption calmly and consistently using a neutral tone, including reference to the shared values of the classroom and school, and applying them fairly to all pupils. This can help to create a supportive and inclusive environment that benefits all pupils.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to respond to low level disruption.
Look out for the following.
<ul>
  <li>
    Responds quickly to low level disruption using least-intrusive interventions
  </li>
  <li>Responds consistently to pupil behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
Low level disruption can be a real problem in classrooms, and we need to address
it quickly. I'm going to model some of the ways in which you can do this. The
context is a year 10 music lesson. The pupils have been working at their
keyboards working on their compositions, and I have now signalled for them to
remove the headphones so they can hear me.

<em>“Okay, so when I finish speaking, I want you to turn off your </em>

<em>[Teacher pauses and waits to gain full attention of the class] </em>

<em>
  Turn off your keyboards, unplug your headphones, and turn to show me that
  you're ready.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher stands still, intentionally scanning classroom to spot pupils who are
  following instructions]
</em>

<em>Off you go. I've got the back table facing me. </em>

<em>[Teacher notices a few pupils not following instructions]</em>

<em>Just waiting for three more people. </em>

<em>
  Okay, we're ready. Okay, so Kaitlin I want you to play the first four bars of
  your composition, okay?{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Everybody else, hands off your keyboards and listening out for the 4/4 time
  signature. Off you go.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher approaches a pupil who has not followed instruction and addresses
  them directly, in a quiet and neutral tone]
</em>

<em>Riley, hands off the keyboard please.”</em>

In this example, I used several proactive and reactive interventions for low level disruption. Remember that you might not need to use all of these strategies at once or in the same order.

Firstly, I stopped speaking when one pupil was fiddling with the headphone wire. This was reactive strategy. In my classroom, I've established the expectation that pupils need to look at me when I'm speaking. Pausing in a way which is obvious when one pupil is off task is often enough to get their attention and remind them and the others of the expectation to look at me. I've consistently maintained this expectation, and over time, the vast majority of pupils meet it.

A proactive approach I used was to use a positive frame. When some of the pupils were not unplugging headphones and turning off keyboards as I expected, I focused first on those that were. A quick reminder to pupils of what I expect them to do is often enough to stop low level disruption. I then follow this up with a second reminder, I'm waiting for three pupils. An anonymous reminder like this can help get pupils get back on track without drawing lots of attention to the negative behaviour.

Finally, I modelled how to respond on an individual basis where appropriate. Riley wasn't sitting still and listening to the composition as he had been asked to do. So I walked up to his desk and give him a clear reminder: <em>“Riley, hands off the keyboard”</em>. As with the previous examples, I used a quiet tone so as not to escalate the situation, but equally, I made my expectations clear. There should be no room for confusion or disagreement here. Notice that my tone throughout was formal and neutral when issuing the intervention. I reverted to my original tone when pupils were back on task. I want to respond to low level in the same consistent manner whenever it occurs. Stop it, address it and get back on with the lesson as quickly as possible.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
This video has covered a range of ideas and strategies to help you respond to low
level disruption. Read over the key ideas before you finish. Which of these ideas
will you focus on first?
<ul>
  <li>
    Use early and least intrusive interventions as an initial response to low
    level disruption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish a supportive and inclusive environment by giving pupils
    opportunities to follow instructions.
  </li>
  <li>Respond consistently to pupil behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Responding to low level disruption isn't something that only new teachers should
think about. Staying on task can be difficult for all pupils. Learning requires
effort, and sometimes it feels hard. All teachers need to be aware of this and
know how they will respond when a pupil gets off task. This will help to
maintain a positive and effective learning environment for all. $EndContent

## Teaching challenge

Ms Silva feels she can secure positive behaviour from most pupils most of the time. However, she occasionally finds a few pupils are not following her instructions or are being disruptive in subtle ways. For example, having whispered conversations during a silent task, or turning around to talk to others when she is not looking. Ms Silva worries that, over time, others will begin to follow suit. How can she address this low-level disruption?

## Key idea

Tackling low-level disruption – both proactively and reactively – can improve learning and foster a positive classroom environment over time.

## Evidence summary

### Proactively addressing low-level disruption

Ms Silva has noticed occasional instances of low-level disruption. Research suggests there is a link between time on task and pupil learning (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010), so low-level disruption is a problem because it reduces time on task, making the learning environment less effective. Effective teaching can address this by _proactively_ avoiding problem behaviours where possible and reacting to get learning back on track (IES, 2008).

In effective learning environments, pupils are clear about what they are expected to do (IES, 2008). Ms Silva has already considered how to convey clear behavioural expectations through routines, instructions and directing pupil attention. Fundamental to this is ensuring expectations are specific enough for pupils to know exactly what they are expected to do, without any confusion or ambiguity, making it less likely they’ll go off-task. For example, ”I expect everyone to be silent, with pens down and eyes on me” is more concrete than “I need your attention”, where it is not clear whether pupils are still allowed to talk, where they should be facing or what exactly they should be doing. In the second example confusion or ambiguity could lead to pupils going off-task. Alongside clear behavioural expectations it is also helpful if teachers explain the purpose and benefits of a task so pupils know both what they are expected to do and why.

She can also be proactive by positively reinforcing these expectations through acknowledgement, drawing attention to these behaviours. For example, once she has shared a concrete behaviour, she can say ”I can hear Sarah and Katie talking in partner voices about question 2.” She could also make links to shared values and classroom and school culture: “I can see Katie and Sarah are taking turns, which is respectful.” She should however avoid lavish praise unless expectations have been exceeded, as unwarranted praise lowers pupil motivation (Coe et al., 2014).

### Reactive teacher reminders help pupils stay on task

Reminders are powerful reactive strategies, to ensure pupils successfully stay on task once proactive strategies have been used. While clear and concise expectations help pupils understand what strategies are best applied to tasks, effective reminders can help pupils follow through with those strategies (IES, 2008). Many of the strategies that teachers employ to direct pupil attention are also useful for tackling low-level disruption.

For example:

- **Anonymous & positive framing** Picking out examples of expected behaviour without naming names. “I can see four people have already opened their exercise books.”
- **Targeting specific pupil behaviours** Naming and reminding particular pupils what they should be doing using concise language. “Edward: facing your partner.”
- **Private correction** if pupils need a further reminder or sanction, doing this privately, where possible, in a quick one to one conversation avoids class attention and saves face for the pupil. For example, quietly saying to an individual “That’s a first consequence. I should see you facing your partner discussing the work.”
- **Highlighting the benefits** Teachers can briefly remind pupils of the purpose of the task and how it might help them achieve their goals during the task. “Knowing your number bonds will help you solve numerical problems much faster.”

Taken together, such strategies can reduce low-level disruption and increase the likelihood that pupils successfully complete tasks. Effective learning environments are predictable (IES, 2008), so Ms Silva needs to be consistent with her reminders, for example by linking them to school rules and behavioural expectations.

### Improving pupil-teacher relationships

Consistently addressing low-level disruption can also improve pupil-teacher relationships and pupil wellbeing. Pupils have positive perceptions of predictable and secure learning environments, where teachers effectively monitor and manage the class (Rathmann et al., 2018). In contrast, when teachers show low expectations of pupil success, this can lead to reduced pupil self-belief and motivation (Tsiplakies & Keramida, 2010). This can sometimes happen in an unspoken and unintentional way. For example, correcting minor transgressions by some pupils but not others can imply the teacher thinks some pupils are more likely to misbehave or less able to complete a task than others. This can have a knock-on effect on pupil motivation and learning, which can be particularly detrimental for low-attaining pupils (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Teachers must be careful not to inadvertently communicate low expectations by permitting low-level disruption or being inconsistent. What we permit, we promote.

### Nuances and caveats

Teachers do not need to respond in a subtle way to **every** instance of disruption. School behaviour policies often have rewards and sanctions and it is appropriate to use these, particularly to address significant disruption. But where possible, proactive, least intrusive and positive reinforcement of clear behavioural expectations are most effective (IES, 2008). Prevention is better than cure.

Negative pupil emotions can also lead to low-level disruption where pupils avoid learning. This can happen where pupils suspect they might fail at a task, especially when failure poses a threat to their positive self-image (Kluger & DeNisi 1996). In the longer-term, teachers can address this by developing pupils’ ability to self-regulate their emotions (EEF, 2017). Immediately, teachers can usually avoid this issue by ensuring clear expectations and reminders give pupils the best chance of being successful. Teachers can also make extra reminders and help private, to preserve pupil self-image in front of their peers and give pupils time to respond to the correction, to overcome possible emotional responses to having their behaviour corrected.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Consistency is a powerful tool that teachers can develop. Behaving in the same way
over time helps pupils to know what to expect from their teacher. This creates trust.
It also helps to create a predictable and secure environment that we know benefits
all pupils.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
In practice, consistency applies to many parts of teaching. It means giving clear
expectations that set out what you would like pupils to do, modelling the behaviours
you expect to see, and supporting pupils to do the same through positive reinforcement,
for example. It means repeating the same, specific words to communicate classroom
and school values. This requires planning and practising, and it means treating every
single pupil with the same polite, respectful, and courteous manner that you would
ask for in return. It is also important that teachers respond in a consistent way
to similar behaviours from different pupils, both positive and negative. Sticking
closely to the classroom behaviour system really helps with this.

Here's one way of rewarding positive behaviour.

<ol>
  <li>Briefly state the behaviour.</li>
  <li>Set out the reward.</li>
  <li>Explain how this will help the pupil to achieve a long-term goal.</li>
</ol>
Linking positive behaviour to success in learning may help pupils to be motivated
by intrinsic factors, rather than extrinsic ones.

Here's one suggestion for how you might give a sanction.

<ol>
  <li>Briefly state the behaviour.</li>
  <li>State the consequence.</li>
  <li>Explain to pupils how they can get back on track.</li>
</ol>
For example: <em>
  “Colin, you were talking when Iris was giving her answer. That means you
  missed out on hearing her great answer. You need to pay attention to what
  everyone says during class discussions. You can use those ideas in your own
  work, and it shows you value others.”{" "}
</em>
Issuing sanctions in a consistent manner each time helps teachers and pupils to
remain calm. It also deescalates the situation and ultimately helps to build
trust.

Rewards and sanctions are not the only way of encouraging positive behaviour. Teachers need to help pupils behave in a way that supports learning because they want to do it for themselves, but rewards and sanctions can help pupils to get there, so teachers need to know what the system in their school is.

The more that pupils see a teacher behaving in the same way over time, the more likely they are to associate that teacher with those qualities. If teachers behave in a way that is consistent, pupils will feel that their teacher is consistent. This, in turn, creates a sort of trusting relationship that benefits pupils' learning.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of one way to respond to a pupil who's
been repeatedly off task. As you watch, focus on the following:
<ul>
  <li>Responds consistently to pupil behaviour.</li>
  <li>
    Applies, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating
    behaviour incidents as appropriate.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
In this example, I'm going to model how to give a sanction to a pupil who is not
doing what I have asked. I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year 10
science class. Pupils are working on an independent writing task, comparing two
different models of the atom. I've provided lots of support and guidance to make
sure that the pupils have the knowledge and skills to attempt this task. The
expectation is, therefore, that pupils are silent and remain focused on the task
with pen to paper, and this has been shared with the pupils. If they have a
question, they ought to raise their hand to gain my attention. Here, a pupil
called Tom has turned around and tried to talk to his friend. My first response
is to give a reminder without naming Tom.

<em>
  “We need to be facing forwards, working silently pen to paper. If you have a
  question, you need to raise your hand.
</em>

<em>[Teacher looks towards pupil who is not following instruction]</em>

<em>Tom, facing forwards, working silently, thank you. </em>

<em>
  [Teacher pause and scans the room. As pupil does not follow instructions,
  teachers approaches pupil to address them directly.  Teacher{" "}
</em>
<em>
  crouches in front of the desk, in a position where he can still see the rest
  of the class]
</em>

<em>
  Tom, this is the third time that you've turned around in your chair. You need
  to be facing forwards, writing. If you need help, raise your hand and I will
  come and help you. Thank you for starting writing quickly, good job.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Teacher circulates the classroom and then returns to Tom]</em>

<em>
  Yeah, lovely work, Tom. I can see that you've already compared the position of
  the electrons in the two models, good work.”
</em>

The aim of the model was to show how to respond consistently to pupil behaviour in line with school policy. When I first saw a few pupils, including Tom, turned around or chatting, I gave an anonymous reminder of my expectations that pupils should be facing forwards and writing silently.

When I then saw Tom was still turned around in his chair, I gave a quick, named response. This is an escalation, as Tom now knows I have noticed that he is not following instructions, and I've specifically reminded him of the expectations. I did this quickly and in a neutral tone. I don't want to draw attention this low level disruption, but I do need to respond to it.

When I saw Tom turn around a third time, I gave a private sanction, which included stating the error, stating the consequence, and explaining how he could get back on track. I ensured that the conversation was not in front of the class because this can sometimes escalate a situation, and I wanted Tom to focus on what I was saying. I also quickly acknowledged that he had listened and was now following my instructions.

Later in the lesson, having focused for the remainder of the task, Tom had produced some high-quality work and I praised him for his effort.

I treated Tom in the same way as other pupils, holding him to account when he was off task, praising his efforts when appropriate. My tone was the same throughout the model, formal and calm. This consistent tone shows pupils that I'm able to manage the situation and that I will maintain my expectations I have set out.

Finally, my language was consistent. I used language and a structure that my pupils are now familiar with. <em>“Face the front” </em>is a short, quick phrase that clearly tells pupils what to do, and one which I always use. And I use the same format for issuing a sanction: state the error, state the consequence, and explain how to get back on track.

Responding to pupil behaviour in the same way over time means that I can act quickly and fairly. This normally deescalates negative behaviour and maintains a positive learning environment.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have considered why it's important that teachers are consistent
and looked at some ways in which they can achieve this. Take a moment to read the
key ideas. Which ones do you think the example best illustrated?
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Responding consistently to pupil behaviour can be hard in the beginning. It can be
difficult for teachers to know what they will say and do on the spot. Picking one
specific response to plan and practise outside of the classroom really helps you
to know what to do when you're standing in front of your pupils. Plan and practise
in advance so you can be consistent in the moment. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Ms Mahrez is able to tackle disruptive classroom behaviour when it arises, but some of her pupils need constant monitoring to keep them on task and others do little more than the minimum required to complete the task. What can she do to create an even more productive learning environment?

## Key idea

Being consistent in sharing and reinforcing expectations supports pupil motivation. Over time it can generate an increasingly positive, stable and effective learning environment.

## Evidence summary

### Consistency and systems

When teachers are predictable in how they act, pupils come to know what to expect, feel more secure in the classroom and can focus more on their learning (Rathmann et al., 2018). Being predictable entails being consistent in how we respond to similar behaviours by different pupils (both good and bad), and by consistently modelling expected attitudes, values and behaviours (IES, 2008).

One way to increase the predictability of our action is by sticking closely with a classroom behaviour system aligned with wider school expectations. Such systems often include (IES, 2008):

- **Proactive** teaching of sanctions and rewards.
- **Reactive** procedures for responding to common situations.
- Basic policies for _escalating_ persistent or extreme behaviour.

It is important that the system is simple to follow and easy to remember, for example with consistent language and non-verbal reminders for common classroom tasks. When this is the case, Ms Mahrez will be able to respond quickly without having to think too hard about every situation, and so is more likely to respond consistently over time.

The most effective systems are those that use reinforcement of positive behaviours more than reprimands (IES, 2008). However, teachers must also be careful not to over-use praise (Coe et al., 2014), using acknowledgement when expectations are met (“Thank you for putting your pen down, Jen”) and only praising when they are exceeded (“Well done for constructing a sentence that uses powerful persuasive language, Jamil”).

### Intrinsic motivation

Effective classroom behaviour systems also make the most of pupils’ intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is when pupils do something because they want to, perhaps because it is related to their identity or values. In contrast, extrinsic motivation is where pupils do something because of a sanction or reward. This distinction is important because pupils who are motivated intrinsically are more likely to behave better and persist longer with tasks when they get challenging (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).

Over time, teachers should aim to gradually reduce pupil reliance on external rewards or sanctions (IES, 2008). Ms Mahrez could do this by using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration, and helping pupils make links between their actions, successes and long-term goals. For example, when setting up a task which requires retrieval of prior knowledge, Ms Mahrez might say “successfully remembering this will help you to learn about figurative language, which are crucial for much of the English we’ll learn in the future and will also help you with everyday reading and writing”.

### Consistency and pupil-teacher relationships

Effective whole school environments often include:

- High expectations from teachers of pupil learning.
- Consistent enforcement of collectively agreed upon disciplinary policies.
- Effective classroom management (Chapman et al., 2013).

Therefore, individual teachers have a role in communicating shared values and improving classroom and school culture. They can do this by reinforcing expectations and following school behaviour policies in their classrooms and around the school. For example, challenging pupils on their manners in the corridor or upholding school rules in the playground.

Teacher consistency can also improve pupil-teacher relationships. Pupil perceptions are based on repeated interactions over time, so when teachers consistently manage the class in a controlled and positive way, pupils are more likely to believe that their teacher has their ‘best interests at heart’ and feel more ‘connected’ to school (Chapman et al., 2013). When this happens, pupils are more likely to interpret corrective interactions from their teacher – for example, being reminded to turn around and listen – as a supportive act rather than just a meaningless punishment.

### Consistency breeds success

In addition to improving pupil wellbeing and whole school climate, consistency over time can have a positive impact on pupil outcomes. When teachers regularly communicate a belief that everyone is able to achieve academically, their pupils are more likely to live up to those expectations (Murdock-Perriera et al., 2018). Furthermore, when teachers are able to consistently enable success, pupils will increasingly believe in their own ability, feel more positive about school and improve their outcomes over time.

In short, consistency is a powerful tool for promoting high expectations, enabling a positive whole-school climate and building trusting pupil-teacher relationships.

### Nuances and caveats

Teaching pupils strategies to develop their ability to self-regulate their emotions can also lead to more consistent pupil responses in the long term - for example, developing pupil emotional language to express the problems they are experiencing and self-calming strategies to support them to learn more effectively when the content is challenging (EEF, 2018). Supporting pupil success can also help (IES, 2008). Enabling pupils to be successful can minimise emotional barriers while developing emotional self-regulation.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
We want our classrooms to feel like good places. We want the classroom environment
to be positive, secure, and safe. We want all pupils to know that their efforts will
be acknowledged, their successes will be celebrated, and that they can learn from
their mistakes. Teachers can create this positive environment and within it pupils
can thrive.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>A positive environment is one in which all pupils are supported
to learn and develop, whatever their starting points. The teacher has high expectations
of their ability and they're able to focus on their learning without getting distracted,
encountering barriers or worrying about making mistakes. They are provided with helpful
strategies to self-regulate their emotions. All of this together helps to create
a positive and inclusive environment that helps all pupils to be successful.

There are many ways in which teachers can build a positive learning environment. Establishing effective routines and expectations provides an important foundation. This means your routines are running smoothly, you set clear expectations, including the positive behaviours that you want to see and you are consistent in your approach. For example, before asking a question to the class you might remind them that making mistakes is normal and that everyone is expected to try. Or before taking individual responses, you might remind the rest of the class to think about how they can help if someone gets the answer wrong. We want to create an environment in which making mistakes and learning from them are a big part of the daily routine and it can be helpful to include this in your expectations.

It's also important to explicitly teach the sorts of behaviours that create a positive learning environment and support pupil learning. This will involve identifying the behaviours that you want to see and thinking of ways to teach them to pupils. In a primary setting, for example, you might want pupils to be able to express what they are feeling and so teach them about a range of different emotions to expand their emotional vocabulary as well as physiological symptoms like sweating palms or more rapid breathing. These physiological symptoms are often signs of certain emotions and pupils need to recognize them so that they know what to do when they occur. Another strategy is to teach pupils how to use a sentence stem that helps them to express their feelings. I feel something because. Being able to name and describe emotions is an important first step in being able to self-regulate them.

Teachers also need to model the positive behaviours that will support learning. Teachers are role models who can influence the attitudes, values, and behaviours of their pupils. This includes being polite, respectful, and courteous to all pupils, modelling what to do when they find a task difficult or modelling what to do when they make a mistake. For example, a teacher might say,<em> "I know this task will feel difficult, but I'm going to attempt it, and if I get the answer wrong, I can fix it.  Mistakes are normal and this will help with my learning much more than if I don't attempt it at all."</em> What teachers do in the classroom can have a big impact on what their pupils do.

As well as modelling positive behaviours, teachers can reinforce positive behaviours by drawing attention to them. Teachers need to look out for positive behaviours from all pupils and acknowledge them when they occur such as packing away their books neatly, reading over their work to check for spelling errors, or offering a toy to another child to play with. A simple neutral description of the positive behaviour works well. Teachers can praise behaviours that exceed their expectations. If a pupil works especially hard on a task, a teacher might say something like,<em> "Well done for persevering through that second task, even though it was really challenging."</em> Drawing attention to effort rather than ability is an important feature of a positive learning environment.

Of course, creating a positive learning environment doesn't mean that we avoid all negatives. There may well be times when it's appropriate and necessary to provide a sanction to a pupil, especially any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. Equally, over praising pupils for simply meeting rather than exceeding your expectations can backfire as it might cause pupils to try less hard in the future. But, if we want our pupils to do their best work, we need to build an environment that is positive, predictable, and safe.

Teachers have a huge influence on pupils. It's in their grasp to create an environment where pupils succeed.

<h3>Exemplification framing</h3>
Let's look at a model of how you can actively build a positive learning environment.
You're about to watch an example of how to respond to a pupil error. As you watch,
pay particular attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Show that making mistakes and learning from them are part of the daily
    routine
  </li>
  <li>Creates a culture of respect and trust</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
One way in which teachers can build a positive learning environment is to make
pupils feel safe enough to reveal errors. I'm going to model a way of responding
to mistakes. I'm teaching a year nine maths class and they have just been
practicing how to calculate percentage increase using the multiplier method.

<em>
  “Okay, I want to find out how much you understand about using the multiplier
  method to calculate percentage increase, and as I said before we started
  working, I'm going to call on some individuals to share their answers but also
  their thinking process.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now remember, we haven't done this before and there are quite a few steps, so
  you might have made some mistakes. Don't worry if you have, that is normal and
  this will give you a chance to correct those mistakes.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now for those of you who are listening to people as they feedback their
  answers, I want you to be thinking about whether you think the answer is
  correct or not and be thinking about why. So we've all got a really important
  job to do here so let's try our best.{" "}
</em>

<em>Okay, Anna, can you tell me what answer you got? </em>

<em>[Pupil gives incorrect answer] </em>

<em>
  Okay, can you tell me how you got that answer? [Teacher uses same neutral
  tone]
</em>

<em>[Pupil explains their process and teacher writes it up on the board]</em>

<em>Okay, thank you. We're going to come back to that. </em>

<em>Josh, can you tell me what answer you got? </em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>
  And can you tell me how you got that answer? [Teacher uses same neutral tone]
</em>

<em>[Pupil explains their process and teacher writes it up on the board]</em>

<em>
  Okay, thank you Anna and Josh. I now understand a lot more about you're
  thinking.
</em>

<em>
  Anna, you made a couple of mistakes. Put your hands up around the classroom
  if, as you listened, you realized that you also made a couple of mistakes.{" "}
</em>

<em>[A number of pupils put their hands up]</em>

<em>
  Yeah, so we're going to go through this process again now. We're going to
  identify where we went wrong and then we're going to correct our thinking.”
</em>

In this model, making mistakes and learning from them is just a normal part of what we do. I told pupils that it's likely that some of them will have made mistakes because this is new and challenging material. Anticipating mistakes helps both teachers and pupils to react in a neutral way when they occur. Mistakes are not surprising, they are to be expected. I also asked each pupil to explain their thinking so that we can identify the mistake clearly. I'm not just interested in whether the pupils got the answer right or wrong. Instead, I want to understand why they have given this answer. I want to understand their thinking.

This model also demonstrated a way of creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom. I reacted to both pupils who gave their answer in the same way, thanking them and using a neutral tone. I didn't comment on their answer at this stage. Also, I reminded all pupils that they could learn a lot by listening to someone else's response, even if it's wrong. I'm making it clear that in this classroom we value the contributions that every pupil makes.

This is one example of how you can create a positive learning environment but it won't be as effective on its own. Positive learning environments grow through an accumulation of small steps that teachers can plan and practise. Over time, and with a consistent approach, they can ensure that classrooms are a safe place for all pupils to learn.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video we've thought about what a positive learning environment might look
like and some of the ways in which teachers can achieve this. Before we finish, have
a look at the key ideas. Which of these are best illustrated by the model?
<ul>
  <li>
    Creating a positive environment where making mistakes and learning from them
    and the need for effort and perseverance are part of the daily routine
  </li>
  <li>
    Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made

## Teaching challenge

Ms Mahrez is increasingly pleased with the behaviour of her pupils. However, they are not always willing to think hard or take risks in their learning. For example, they are sometimes reluctant to contribute answers when they think they might be incorrect and give up quickly when tasks are challenging. She wants pupils to develop approaches to challenging goals which support them to be resilient and independent. How can Ms Mahrez move from simply managing behavioural issues such as low-level disruption, to actively encouraging behaviours that underpin successful learning?

## Key idea

Teachers should seek to model and develop positive attitudes, values and behaviours that underpin successful learning – particularly emotional self-regulation – and show pupils the role of making mistakes in being successful.

## Evidence summary

### Moving beyond compliance

Teacher expectations matter: the extent to which a teacher believes a pupil is likely to achieve alters that pupil’s experience of the classroom and their own likelihood of success (Coe et al., 2014; Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010). Ms Mahrez has communicated and embedded high expectations of pupil behaviour into her classroom routines and behaviour management systems. With these essential foundations in place, she now needs to build further on these to maximise pupil learning. This can be achieved by modelling and embedding attitudes, values and behaviours that support pupils to learn more successfully.

Effective teaching sets goals which challenge pupils and is demanding yet supportive in ensuring pupils successfully meet these (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Mahrez has reflected on the behaviours she wants to see and those which her pupils would benefit most from developing to successfully tackle such work. For example, she wants her pupils to be willing to join class discussions and offer answers even when their thinking is not fully developed, or when there is a risk of being wrong. Pupils sharing their thinking will enable her to gather more information on what her pupils know and don’t know, improving her ability to teach responsively and supporting pupil success (Black and Wiliam, 2009; Speckesser et al., 2018).

Ms Mahrez’s focus is still on the climate in her classroom but it has shifted from behaviours which might hinder her teaching to behaviours which will support her to teach, and pupils to learn, more successfully.

### **Modelling effective learning behaviours**

Adults can be powerful role models for pupils. Where trusting relationships are present, what teachers do will influence how pupils behave and the choices they make (Johnson et al., 2016). Ms Mahrez realises that before explaining desired behaviours she first needs to model them – how she acts is as important as what she says. Once Ms Mahrez has planned exactly what she wants to model to pupils – for example, proactively contributing, sharing answers that they are unsure of and supporting others who contribute in class – she can then direct pupil attention to her behaviours in these areas.

Effective teaching ensures that pupils experience success and helps them recognise failures as natural steps on the path to future success (Coe et al, 2014). Ms Mahrez can embrace this by showing pupils why errors are useful for her teaching, what a respectful and safe class climate looks like and calling on pupils to emulate these resilient and motivated behaviours.

Effective teaching also seeks to develop pupils’ emotional self-regulation (EEF, 2018). By modelling the emotional impact of sharing an answer that might be wrong, she can help pupils develop their self-awareness (“this might feel hard”) and their self-regulation (“making an attempt and failing is a natural part of learning. Getting it wrong now is a step on the path to getting it right in the future”). This is crucial as often pupils refuse tasks where they feel there is a risk they will fail (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996).

### **Supporting** **pupils to understand and adopt effective learning behaviours**

In addition to modelling, Ms Mahrez can improve her classroom environment by supporting pupils to understand and adopt behaviours and attitudes that will help them to learn more effectively.

To achieve this, Ms Mahrez needs to direct pupil attention to the specific behaviours she has modelled – particularly linked to resilience and motivation – and explain why these are important. For example, she can explain that it is important for pupils to be open in contributing answers in class so that she can understand their errors. She can also explain that she needs pupils to be supportive and respectful of each other to create an environment where classmates feel comfortable contributing even where they might be wrong. Pupil behaviours can further be shaped by behaviour they observe in their peers (IES, 2008). So, Ms Mahrez should draw attention to other pupils exhibiting the positive behaviours she wants to see.

Effective teachers often attribute pupil success to ‘effort rather than ability’, and value ‘resilience to failure’ (Coe et al, 2014). In developing this attitude in her pupils, Ms Mahrez needs to reward effort and highlight its contribution to success. When a pupil works hard, thinks hard or attempts a problem, Ms Mahrez should construct her praise to help pupils understand that these behaviours and mind-sets are valuable approaches to learning that will make success more likely.

When reinforcing her modelling, Ms Mahrez should ensure her words and actions line up. She should consistently remind pupils who are not meeting her expectations, and still distinguish between acknowledgement for expectations met and praise for expectations exceeded.

### **Nuances and caveats**

Getting the balance between pupil success and encouraging pupil errors is challenging for Ms Mahrez. Teachers should aim for a high success rate (Coe et al., 2014) while developing pupil emotional self-regulation to support them to address the inevitable negative feelings around errors.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Pupils are more likely to attempt to task if they feel they can do it. This isn't
unusual. Most people are put off doing something that feels difficult in favour of
something that feels easier. It's important that teachers think about the supports
they can put in place to enable and encourage all pupils to access their learning,
including pupils with SEND. Providing structured support of learning can lead to
positive behaviour and help all pupils to thrive.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Providing structured, supportive learning is about ensuring that all pupils can access
the content and think hard. When pupils are able to access their learning, they're
more likely to experience success. This can be motivating and lead to positive behaviour.

Learning new material can put a strain on our limited working memory capacity. As it tries to deal with lots of new information at once. This can easily feel overwhelming, but there are strategies that teachers can use to help focus student's attention and show them a clear route through. These include reducing distractions, breaking learning into small steps, and modelling.

Breaking material into steps can really help pupils. For example, instead of setting a task in a primary maths lesson like multiply 26 by 48, we might identify specific steps. Partition the number 26, multiply each part by 40, and then add them together. In a phonics lesson, it is important that pupils practice segmenting a word into individual signs, such as er, uh, nn, before blending them together again. These individual steps helps pupils to know how to start and what to do along the way. Breaking material into steps can be especially helpful for pupils with SEND, as it can give them a clear picture of what they need to do now, and next, making learning feel more manageable. Teachers should also ensure that any new knowledge builds on what pupils already know. In the maths example, pupils will need to know about partitioning and multiplication.

Modelling learning and providing examples is another important way of supporting learning. As teachers model, they can help their pupils to stay focused, by drawing attention to the key aspects of the learning. Thinking out loud and numbering the steps is another useful support. For example, first I add up the ones. Then I add up the 10s. It's also essential to keep checking that pupils are listening, pausing during the model if pupils get off track.

Putting supports in place like breaking learning down and modelling does not just mean making it easy. Activities should require pupils to put in effort and think, but if a pupil can't access what they're learning, it's likely to have a negative impact on how they act in the classroom. Providing structured, supportive learning can help pupils to experience success, which in turn has a positive impact on behaviour.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to provide structured support of
learning. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Breaks complex material into smaller steps</li>
  <li>Checks pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>A really good way of
supporting learning is to take an end goal and break it into smaller chunks.
These smaller chunks feel more doable and help to guide pupil thinking. Imagine
I'm teaching a reception class, how to form the lowercase letter m.

<em>
  “In handwriting today, we are going to be learning the sound, mm. Mmm. You
  would have learned the sound in reception as down Maisie, mountain, mountain.
  Now in year one, we need to be accurate with how our Ms look and how we form
  our Ms. I'm going to show you how I would do it, and I want you to pay close
  attention, because in a minute you will be doing it too.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher writes on white board] I'm going to start at the top of Maisie here.
  I'm going to do a straight line down, straight, straight, straight, come back
  up and stop at Maisie's shoulder [teacher gestures to shoulder]. I'm going to
  form my first mountain by going around and down, and then back up. I'll stop
  at the shoulder again, just to make sure both mountains are the same size. I'm
  going to go around, down, straight, straight, and I'll add a flick of grass at
  the end.”
</em>

In this example, I was careful to break learning down into smaller steps. Individual steps included drawing a line straight down, starting the mountain 2/3 of the way up, at Maisie's shoulder, and ensuring that the mountains were the same size. These are the most important steps that I want pupils to remember. It's easier for them to focus on these smaller parts, one by one, rather than having to remember how the whole letter is formed at once.

Before I started the model, I made sure that every pupil was paying attention by explicitly telling them to watch me because they would be doing the same task on their own. During the model, I was constantly checking the whole group to make sure that all pupils were watching me form the letter. Notice how I help focus pupil's attention by repeatedly telling pupils where to look, have a look, same size. I'm helping to guide their thinking so that they pay attention to the most important things. I also reduced distractions by writing on a blank sheet of paper. Pupils can easily get distracted, so it's important that we think of ways to direct their attention.

After I delivered my initial model, I would ask pupils to help me form another letter, prompting them to tell me the key steps. This will give them another good example and allow me to check that they have understood the task before getting them to work on their own. When pupils are clear about what they should do and how they can be successful, it motivates them to get started.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored how providing structured, supportive learning can
improve pupil behaviour, and considered some of the ways in which teachers can do
this. Now read through the following key ideas that the video has covered. Which
ones do you feel that the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>Breaking complex material into smaller steps</li>
  <li>
    Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught
  </li>
  <li>Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
When pupils find learning too difficult, they can easily disengage. Breaking
complex material down into smaller chunks and taking them through it step by
step shows them that they can be successful. And when pupils feel like they are
able to do something, they're much more likely to give it a go. $EndContent

## Teaching challenge

Ms Sterling notices that, while pupils are willing to attempt class work, when they perceive tasks to be too hard this leads to off-task behaviour – including getting distracted and sometimes distracting others. How can she make learning more manageable, supporting pupils to persist at tasks?

## Key idea

Breaking challenging tasks into steps and providing support when necessary makes it more likely pupils will persist with tasks.

## Evidence summary

### Making learning manageable supports on-task pupil behaviour

Challenging behaviour can arise when there is a mismatch between classroom academic demands and pupil capabilities (IES, 2008). This happens because working memory capacity is limited and can become easily overloaded when pupils are asked to complete tasks which are unfamiliar or overly complex (Gathercole et al., 2008; IES, 2008). Pupils may seek to avoid a task if it seems threatening to their sense of self (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996): for example, if a pupil thinks they might fail at the task.

By making learning manageable, teachers affect how pupils behave, as well as how they learn (IES, 2008). Ms Sterling has already been thinking about the foundations of managing behaviour: telling pupils the types of behaviour she expects, modelling this, and responding consistently. Refining her instruction is another way to improve pupils’ learning behaviours since students’ success can build their motivation and confidence (Coe et al., 2014). Introducing new material in steps is a particularly effective approach to making learning more manageable (Rosenshine, 2012).

### **Introducing new material in steps and using examples makes it more manageable**

Checking pupil prior knowledge and explicitly linking new ideas to what has previously been learned makes it less likely pupils working memory will be overloaded (Deans for Impact, 2015). Ms Sterling could use several instructional principles to support pupils in this way (Rosenshine, 2012):

- Briefly reviewing what pupils have already learned.
- Introducing new material in small steps.
- Checking pupil understanding of the new knowledge regularly.
- Allowing pupils to practise using this new knowledge in steps whilst providing models and scaffolds for this practice.

Introducing new materials in steps like this helps make new material more manageable, making it more likely pupils will persist with the task.

### **Guides and scaffolds also help pupils think about key ideas to be learned**

Learning can also be made more manageable by providing pupils with ‘scaffolding’. This can be tools that complete part of the task for the students, or a model of the completed task itself (Rosenshine, 2012). In the early years, scaffolds might even be physical objects such as counters and toys (EEF, 2017); among older pupils they could be cue cards or checklists (Rosenshine, 2012).

Scaffolding simply means providing pupils with support to tackle a problem or demonstrate their learning (Rosenshine, 2012). By making the task more manageable, Ms Sterling can avoid overwhelming her pupils’ working memories and make it easier for them to focus attention on particular aspects. For example, worked examples can be particularly helpful for Ms Sterling’s pupils as these stop pupils searching for any possible answer to a task. This reduces distractions by supporting pupils to focus only on each step of a successful solution (Deans for Impact, 2015).

Scaffolded tasks should be challenging as well as manageable. Making learning manageable doesn’t mean lowering expectations of all or some pupils. Where this balance isn’t achieved, pupils may become frustrated or bored, as the task can be perceived to be beyond (or beneath) their capability (van de Pol et al., 2015). This frustration or boredom can then result in low-level disruption. Scaffolding should therefore be used in a targeted way and be removed when pupils show they are able to be successful at a task, supporting pupils to become independent (Rosenshine, 2012).

### **Nuances and caveats**

Ensuring pupil working memory doesn’t become overloaded doesn’t mean setting unchallenging work – it means helping pupils to think hard about what they have just learnt by providing structured support as appropriate (Deans for Impact, 2015).

While teachers provide pupils with temporary ‘scaffolds’, it is important that these are withdrawn once pupils are experiencing success, as scaffolds inhibit independent practice once pupils have mastered the material taught (Rosenshine, 2012).

While good task and lesson design can help pupils to focus, ultimate responsibility for a pupil’s behaviour rests with the pupil, not with the teacher. If a pupil is unfocused, a teacher may wish to consider whether a change to the task design might avoid this in future. But this does not mean that the solution to pupils’ lack of focus is always the teacher’s lesson design.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Whatever your subject or phase, there will always be challenging content that your
pupils need to learn. All pupils, regardless of their starting point, need to encounter
an appropriate level of challenge in order to move forward. Challenging content can
be off putting, but challenge is a necessary part of learning. If pupils are going
to meet the high expectations that are set out for them, then we need to think about
how we can make challenging content manageable and show pupils what to do when learning
feels difficult. Thinking hard is rewarding and teachers need to show all pupils
how to respond when they are faced with a challenge.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Challenge is about moving pupils on to the next step, whatever their individual starting
points. For teachers, challenge is about knowing your pupils really well. This means
their prior knowledge, their previous experiences of success, and their beliefs about
their ability to succeed.

When teachers get the level of challenge right for their pupils, pitching work that is not too easy but not too hard, pupils are more likely to experience a high rate of success and be motivated to keep going.

Challenging content isn't just about making things really difficult for your pupils or setting hard work. We don't want to set pupils up to fail. Likewise, pupils might find some aspects of your subject more challenging than others. For example, your pupils might really struggle with drawing and painting but do brilliantly with sculpture.

As well as getting the level of challenge just right, teachers also need to think about how they can get pupils to embrace challenge. This can be a daunting task as most people tend to avoid things that feel difficult. How can teachers get pupils to see the value of challenging work and give it a go?

To begin with, creating a positive learning environment is an important first step. Teachers need to set high expectations, build trust, and encourage pupils to persevere with their learning. This may include teaching and modelling what to do when pupils face challenging content. For example, it may be useful to teach pupils to set a goal, identify a potential barrier, and then anticipate solutions: <em>“I know I want to use more academic vocabulary if I can't think of the word to describe this idea I will look in the keyword bank that I have.”</em> Praising pupils when they exceed your expectations is also important and will help to build a sense of momentum.

Teaching pupils strategies to self-regulate their emotions can also help them to embrace challenge. For example, it can help teach pupils how to recognize when they are feeling frustrated by a difficult task and how they can calm themselves down. Typical physiological signs include rapid breathing, sweaty palms, or a change in their tone of voice. Self-calming techniques include counting to 10, taking deep breaths, and thinking calming thoughts such as "I feel calm." The ability to self regulate one's emotions effects learning and so it's important that teachers provide practical strategies as part of daily classroom activities.

Another way to help your pupils embrace challenge is to ensure the tasks you set are achievable. This is easier said than done. It requires you to know your pupils really well and set tasks that just push them outside of their comfort zone and give them clear guidance on how to complete the work. Complex tasks need to be broken down.

When pupils succeed at a challenging task, it helps them to see challenge as desirable. We want to support pupils to journey from a point where they are reliant on outside factors like praise to where they are happy to give it a go on their own. The more success pupils experience, the more likely they are to give it a go on their own.

One thing to be wary of here is that encouraging pupils to embrace challenge isn't just about telling them that they can do it. Providing motivational speeches can easily backfire if they fail. We need to encourage pupils to try but we also need to ensure they have the support they need to be successful.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In this next example, you will see a model of how to help pupils embrace challenge.
As you watch, look out for the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Sets tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a
    challenging curriculum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Helps pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated
    to work intrinsically.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I will model one way of helping pupils to embrace a challenging
task. Imagine that I'm teaching phonics to a reception class.

<em>
  “Now we're going to learn a new sound called a split diagraph, and this may
  sound a bit tricky at first but we're going to be practicing lots and lots
  until you know it really well. Remember when set one sounds felt a bit hard to
  learn at first and now you know them really well? As we get better at this new
  sound, it's going to feel great that we've learned something new and when you
  spot it in a book, it's going to help you read lots more words.”
</em>

So how did I support pupils to master challenging content? First, I set a task that would stretch pupils but which was achievable. I was happy that pupils were ready to start learning a new sound as they have a really good understanding of set one sounds, individual letters like R, M, and A. So while the task was going to be challenging, it wasn't out of their each and I showed that I would support pupils to master challenging content by reminding them that they will have lots of chance to practice.

Throughout the model my language was consistent with our school values. In our school we talk about the importance of feeling proud when we put effort into our learning. Reminding pupils that they will feel good after learning something new together reinforces the shared goals that we are working towards.

I also wanted to help pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically. To do this, I reminded them of an example when they have faced and overcome a challenging situation in the past and sharing the progress that they have made. Lots of pupils initially struggled with set one sounds but they are now much more confident and enjoying their phonics sessions. I also linked this learning to one of their own long-term goals, getting better at reading. This helps them to see the value of the task. Setting challenging tasks for your pupils is a really important part of learning. It needs to be done in a supportive way so that pupils can experience success.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored the importance of setting goals that challenge and
stretch and some of the strategies that you can use to do this. Before we finish,
read through the key ideas that we have covered. Which ones do you feel best illustrate
the model?
<ul>
  <li>
    Setting tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a
    challenging curriculum
  </li>
  <li>
    Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards
    long-term goals
  </li>
  <li>
    Helping pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being
    motivated to work intrinsically
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
When we get the challenge right we provide our pupils with stories they can tell
themselves of mastering difficult content. This, in turn, can help them next
time they're faced with a difficult task. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

While pupils in Ms Sterling’s class are generally keen to give tasks a go, they often take the safe option and seek support from their teacher or peers whenever possible. How can Ms Sterling help pupils to adopt behaviours that make them more open to challenge?

## Key idea

Pupils who experience success are more likely to be motivated, resilient and open to challenge.

## Evidence summary

### The role of success

Part of Ms Sterling’s job is to maximise pupil learning – this means providing the right level of challenge. However, as well as offering challenge, it is also important that tasks enable pupils to experience a high success rate. This balance is a tricky one to strike.

Evidence suggests that if pupils struggle but are ultimately successful with a task, it is more likely they will remember the material (EEF, 2017). Where pupils have experienced success, they are likely to put in more effort, be more motivated and show more confidence in the future (Coe et al, 2014). This is because where pupils believe in their abilities to complete a specific task, they are more persistent at that task. Their investment is driven by their perceptions of success and failure, particularly if they have limited experience of meaningful success in the past (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).

### Establishing high expectations of success

Research suggests that teachers should aim for pupils to be successful around 80% of the time (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Sterling can build pupil expectations that they will succeed in a task by:

- **Offering rewards and praise:** Providing extrinsic motivation when pupils attempt challenging work. Using positive reinforcement more than negative works best (IES, 2008).
- **Attribution:** Linking effort and success for pupils when introducing or framing tasks (Coe et al., 2014).
- **Avoiding lavish praise:** If used without merit, praise can lower pupil confidence in their own ability (Coe et al., 2014).
- **Championing challenge** Sharing _how_ task effort will lead to future learning success. For example, directing pupils’ attention to others who have succeeded due to their effort, or saying: “this work is designed to be tough, don’t worry if you struggle, this will help you learn.”

These strategies rely on a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. It is worth noting that while teachers can harness **extrinsic** motivation to help get pupils started, **intrinsic** motivation is likely to get pupils to stick at tasks, particularly when things get tricky (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).

### Effective teaching raises success rates

Ms Sterling can increase the chance pupils succeed at challenging tasks by using her emerging expertise in:

- How pupils learn (Deans for Impact, 2015), for example taking care not to overload their working memories.
- Her phase or subject specialism (Rosenshine, 2012; Coe et al., 2014), for example ensuring pupils have had enough input before they attempt challenging tasks, especially with specific barriers they might experience if the topic is particularly tricky, or they have special educational needs.

Her classroom climate is also crucial: when Ms Sterling sets challenging work, there will be times when pupils fail. Building a classroom where pupils trust that failure is okay is therefore important to help pupils deal with failure as a natural part of learning.

### Nuances and caveats

The relationship between teacher expectations and pupil outcomes is indirect. Teachers can best convey high expectations by getting the balance of challenge and support right. This will ensure pupils experience success, which should increase their motivation and sense of self-worth, also supporting their resilience (Coe et al., 2014).

When engineering a high success rate for pupils, Ms Sterling must be careful not to remove challenge altogether. Setting pupils up for success in unchallenging tasks does not build motivation and can embed low expectations if pupils interpret this as low teacher expectations (Coe et al., 2014). Instead, Ms Sterling should ensure she provides enough scaffolding for pupils to be successful and withdraw the scaffolding as pupils get better at a task (Rosenshine, 2012). She can also explain why she is withdrawing scaffolding.\*\*\*\*

Pupil success at a task is an indication that they have successfully learnt lesson content, but not a sure sign – ‘learning’ and ‘performance’ are different.

  <span class="s1">Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</span>
</h3>
To learn effectively, pupils need plenty of opportunities to think hard. Sometimes
we need to do this thinking on our own. There need to be times during lessons when
pupils work independently. Pupils are more likely to do this well when teachers give
clear behavioural expectations for independent practice. We need to provide support
and guidance when pupils work on their own.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Independent practice is about letting our pupils practice on their own. Our ultimate
goal is that pupils are able to use the knowledge and skills without teacher input.
This means free of the support of any teachers or other adults in the room.

Independent practice helps pupils to understand and explore content. We knew that pupils need a chance to play, go over content or consolidate learning on their own. Even after first being exposed to the content, pupils need a chance to continue to practice independently. Practicing can also help retain content so that pupils are able to use it in the future. But knowing how to work on your own is a discipline that needs to be learned. How can teachers help?

First, you need to teach a pupil what your expectations for independent practice are. This involves knowing what expectations are and then explaining them to pupils in detail. Your expectations should be made clear through manageable, specific, and sequential instructions. Once you've shared your expectations, you need to check your pupils have understood them. Ask specific questions that test for understanding one instruction at a time.

When you're confident that pupils have understood your expectations, there's still more to be done. During independent practice, you need to monitor how pupils are getting on. This might involve seeing their play or work by circulating the room. You should use this time to check pupils are meeting your behavioural expectations. Where they are not, you can support them as least intrusively as possible, by giving them a quick reminder. Make this a positive reminder. Instead of telling pupils what they shouldn't be doing, for example, <em>“don't talk”</em>, tell them what they should be doing, <em>“work in silence”</em>.

Setting up independent practice requires a lot of thought. You need to explicitly teach your expectations. It might be easy to assume your pupils should know what is expected of them, but they may well not. Or they simply might've forgotten. Although we call it independent practice, that doesn't mean that teachers don't play an active role. Teachers need to actively monitor and support pupils to enable them to work on their own.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to establish behavioural expectations
for independent practice. As you watch focus on the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations for
    independent work
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitors pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
If we want pupils to focus on their learning and do well during independent
practice, we need to establish clear guidelines. I'm going to model how to share
behavioural expectations before independent work and how to support them stay
focused during this time.

I want you to imagine that I am teaching a year six English lesson. Pupils are going to spend 15 minutes writing an opening to their own story. Over a sequence of learning, I've prepared the class for this task in a number of ways. We have studied the genre that they are writing in. And the pupils have created storyboards to structure their story. For the opening, we have, co-written a model for the class and I have written some sentence starters and created a word bank for them to use.

With this preparation, I'm confident that the pupils will be able to complete the task independently, but I still need to support their behaviour.

<em>
  “OK, you're now going to spend 15 minutes writing the opening to your story.
  During that 15 minutes, I need everybody to be working in silence so that you
  can concentrate really hard. If you gets stuck, before asking for help, I want
  you to look at your storyboards, the model that we've just created together
  and the word bank and the sentence starters in your books. If you still feel
  that you need help, then raise your hands. And either myself or Ms. Stevens
  will come to you.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Ishmael, can you explain to everybody what I'm expecting you to do in the next
  15 minutes?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupils gives correct response]</em>

<em>
  Great. And Aisha, if you get stuck before asking for help, what things should
  you look at?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>

<em>
  Thank you. OK. Does anyone have any more questions? Nope. Great. So I'm going
  to put 15 minutes on the timer, off you go.
</em>

<em>[Teacher scans the room and then circulated as pupils practice]</em>

<em>
  Everyone should be writing or reading through their storyboards or the model
  on the board, or that word bank and the sentence starters in your book. I can
  see lots of pupils are using really well chosen adjectives to set the scene,
  well done.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  If you've got your hand up, can I ask you to check that you've read through
  your storyboards or the model on the boards, or those sentence starters and
  the word bank in your books before asking for help. Thank you. So those of you
  who are putting your hands down, that's showing really good problem solving.”
</em>

Let's unpick this model. Firstly, I set clear expectations for behaviour. I stated what I wanted to see and hear from pupils. Pupils were to work on their own in silence for 15 minutes.

Secondly, I shared the expectation that before asking for help, pupils should read through the model and scaffolds provided. I asked two pupils to reshare these expectations, partly to check for understanding, but partly to restate the expectation to the class. Critically, I was also sure that they had the knowledge, skills and scaffolds to be able to complete the task.

During the independent work, I circulated and made sure that most of the time I positioned myself so I could see the majority of the class. I actively show the pupils that I was checking their behaviour. And when I saw pupils starting to drift off task, I quickly reminded them of my expectations. For example, everybody should be writing or reading through their storyboards. This reminder was phrased positively. It's more helpful to remind pupils what they should do rather than point out what they shouldn't. I also use non-verbal signals to individual pupils when required.  I want to support pupils to keep on task without interrupting others. I also kept pupils on task by acknowledging pupils who were meeting my expectations. For example, thank you to those putting their hands down.

Independent work is critical for pupil learning. However, in order for it to be successful, teachers must be sure that pupils have the knowledge and skills required for the task. Be clear on their behavioural expectations before pupils start and circulate to keep pupils on track.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have looked at how to support pupil behaviour during independent
practice so that we can help them to stay focused. Now read through the key ideas.
Which of these ideas does the example illustrate the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations for
    independent work
  </li>
  <li>Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>
  <li>
    Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Independent practice is a skill that pupils need to be shown how to do well. Our
pupils need support and practice to get the most out of it. When we get this
right pupils are able to do some of their best thinking on their own and
strengthen their understanding in the process.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Silva feels that her pupils are now more open to challenge and will sometimes try to work without scaffolding. However, they still prefer to work with teacher or peer support and may be reluctant to work on their own. Ms Silva finds pupils engage well in helping her solve a tricky problem on the board, but when she says, “your turn”, there are some blank faces. How can she get pupils to adopt behaviours that support independent practice?

## Key idea

Regular, purposeful practice is vital for pupil learning, so teachers need to develop routines and behaviours that support independent practice.

## Evidence summary

### The benefits and challenges of getting pupils to practise

Independent practice is vital to pupil learning and success. To learn, pupils need to think hard about the content they have been taught (Coe, 2013). Effective teachers give plenty of class time for independent practice (Rosenshine, 2012). It has clear benefits for pupils learning in terms of:

- **Developing pupil fluency:** When pupils practise, their understanding becomes more fluent and automatic, making it easier for pupils to apply their knowledge and learn new material (Rosenshine, 2012).
- **Helping pupils remember:** For example, retrieval practice (getting pupils to recall what they have learned) is one of the best ways to ensure pupils remember learning at a later date (Pashler et al., 2008).\*\*\*\*

Sometimes pupils avoid thinking hard – we all do. They also form unrealistic views of how much they know. Therefore, when given a choice, they often don’t choose effective study approaches (Pashler et al., 2008). For example, re-reading their notes may feel easy. Trying to recall what they have learned without support from peers or scaffolding feels harder, but is far more effective (Dunlosky et al., 2013). As pupils are also easily distracted, Ms Silva can best ensure they think hard by insisting that pupils practise independently.

### Getting pupils ready for independent practice

Ms Silva should ask herself whether pupils are ready to practise independently. Do they realise why the effort of independent practice is important for their learning? Explaining the benefits of independent practice will help. For instance, she could explain that:

- We learn what we think hard about.
- Less support leads to better learning once pupils are ready to practise.
- Effort makes success more likely (Coe et al., 2014).

She also needs ensure pupils practise successfully, as failure can damage pupil motivation and sense of self-worth (Coe et al., 2014). Independent practice is best done alone, so Ms Silva needs to provide enough support to ensure success. For example:

- Introducing a manageable amount of new material.
- Leading teacher-guided practice on the same material pupils will practise independently.
- Providing scaffolding (Rosenshine, 2012).

### **Clear expectations and routines enhance independent practice**

Ms Silva can set up independent practice consistently, in a way that develops routines over time. This is likely to contribute to pupil success, helping pupils to value practice. So, Ms Silva should consider how she will consistently:

- **Set clear behavioural and task expectations:** (Coe et al., 2014) This means outlining the behaviours she expects to see during independent practice: ”I should see everyone focusing on their own work silently”, and the task and support she expects pupils to use: ”I want you to complete this exercise on the worksheet, without looking at the work we did last week”.
- **Check for understanding:** When introducing the independent practice tasks, teachers should ask specific, task-focused questions to get a clear sense of whether pupils have understood instructions (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Silva should avoid questions like: “do we all understand this?”, where pupils’ default answer is ”yes”, even if they may not understand, or social pressure prevents them admitting to gaps in understanding (Rosenshine, 2012).
- **Circulate:** Checking pupils are following instructions and holding them to account is distinct from supporting with work (Lemov, 2015). Research suggests that as teachers circulate, they should check in with individual pupils for no more than around 30 seconds (Rosenshine, 2012). Longer contacts could disrupt pupil independence by suggesting that teacher support is available.

If Ms Silva is finding many questions arise during independent practice, it might be that pupils are not ready or that they do not understand expectations. She might consider stopping practice, checking that enough support is in place and that pupils have understood her expectations.

### **Nuances and caveats**

Teachers should not set independent tasks when pupils have very little knowledge of a topic (Coe et al., 2014). Pupils will need to be built up and supported through teacher input first. Once this has happened, relevant homework can also be good independent practice of what has been learned, particularly for older pupils. For young pupils, playful practice can be led by pupil interest and teachers should provide just enough support for pupils to be successful (Deans for Impact, 2019).

Effective monitoring during independent practice is often non-verbal – for example, the teacher standing and visibly scanning the classroom. While the importance of reinforcing behaviours with public praise is well known (IES, 2008), during independent practice there is a risk of this distracting pupil attention.There are also benefits of collaborative learning (Kirschner et al., 2018; Rosenshine, 2012), however Ms Silva might prioritise getting independent practice right first to make it more likely collaborative practice succeeds.

<h3>Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</h3>
Getting pupils to work together can increase pupil success. Effective pair and group
work can help pupils to rehearse ideas and deepen their understanding but it can
be hard to get right. In order to get the most out of our pair and group work, we
need to structure collaborative activities carefully, show pupils how to work together,
and help them to stay on track.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Effective pair and group work requires lots of support and lots of practice. Pair
and group work can support learning when it's carried out well. When pupils articulate
their thinking to each other it can help to expose what they already know, develop
their understanding, and reveal misconceptions. Pair and group work can also develop
important interpersonal skills, the ability to listen to somebody else's opinion,
and ask meaningful questions. Collaborative learning can be really powerful but it
needs to be implemented carefully. It's also important that you have secure foundations
in place like good routines and clear instructions. This should help you to focus
more of your attention on the complex task of managing different groups at the same
time.

When asking pupils to carry out pair and group work, teachers need to think about how to structure it so that it can be successful whilst teaching clear expectations for behaviour and supporting pupils to stay on task.

Structuring group work carefully includes ensuring that pupils have relevant prior knowledge to draw on, choosing how to group pupils carefully, and, where appropriate, telling groups which pupil will go first and nominating a pupil to feedback to the class.

Teaching clear expectations for behaviour means intentionally naming the behaviours that you want to see and hear. This could mean behaviour that shows that a pupil is listening such as facing the person speaking, nodding, and not interrupting when they're speaking. Being explicit about how to interact with peers is important for all pupils and can be especially helpful for some pupils with SEND.

Once you have set out your behaviour expectations, it's important to give pupils time to practise them and correct any errors that you see. Practising routines for pair and group work can save a lot of time in the long run and it can make it a much more reliable tool for learning.

During pair and group work, teachers need to support pupils to stay on task. This can mean circulating to see what they are doing, listening in to conversations, and checking that they are making notes as appropriate. Other forms of support for pair and group work include question starters, sentence stems, and vocabulary banks. These can help pupils to stay focused and improve the rigor or their talk.

Overall, teachers need to make sure that they plan pair and group work carefully, set up clear behavioural expectations, and provide appropriate support. This will help pupils to get the best out of working together.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you're going to see a model of how to set up a paired activity.
In it, pupils are asked to recall previously learned content. As you watch, pay particular
attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations for pair and
    group work
  </li>
  <li>
    Provides scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of
    dialogue
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
When pupils know how to take part in paired and group activities effectively it
can be a powerful tool to support learning. Just like teaching pupils how to
engage in independent practice, we need to teach our pupils what our
expectations for paired and group work are so that over time these become
routine. We also need pupils to understand what the purpose of a paired and
group activity is and how it will support their learning goals.

In this video, I'm going to model setting a paired activity which is used to consolidate prior knowledge through repeated practice. I am a Spanish teacher, teacher a year 10 class. In the previous two terms, pupils have been learning about describing and giving opinions about their school. I want pupils to recognize and practise using key knowledge within this topic in written and spoken form. Pupils have already carried out this group task before several times. The structure of the task and the task instructions remain the same each time because I want pupils to be focusing their attention on the content they are working on rather than the logistics of the task. However, even though pupils have done this activity before I want to remind them of the purpose of this group task and give clear instructions.

<em>
  “So we've been working on describing your school and your school routine.
  We're now going to do a group task where you will practise writing and
  listening for this content so that you're able to use the vocabulary with
  greater fluency. You will work in groups of three. One person will dictate,
  one will scribe, and one will be the checker. Just as before, on your tables,
  the piece of paper will tell you which roles you have.{" "}
</em>

<em>So, person A, you have a partially completed text in Spanish. </em>

<em>Person B, you have the other half of that text. </em>

<em>
  Person A, you will read the text you have, and person B, you will listen to
  person A, write down what you hear so that you can fill in the gaps. You must
  speak and write in Spanish at all times.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Person C, once A and B have finished their task, you are to check what they
  have written is correct. You are to note down any errors as well as an
  explanation as to why it is incorrect.{" "}
</em>

<em>For example, an error could be missing an accent on a word. </em>

<em>
  Person C, when checking, just to help, you have a list of possible errors on a
  piece of paper in front of you.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So you have five minutes to complete this task so you need to work carefully
  and efficiently. I will come round to support and just check on how you're
  doing. You also need to speak in a low volume so that you're able to hear each
  other read the texts.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Let's just check that we know what we need to be doing. So, what topic are we
  practicing in this group task? Tanya.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response] </em>

<em>
  Yeah, thank you Tanya. And how many people are there in each group, Rosy?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response] </em>

<em>Yeah, there are three, aren't there? And what are the three roles, Tom.</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Great, thank you Tom, very clear.</em>

<em> So, what are the roles then of person A and person B? Bill. </em>

<em>
  [Pupil gives correct response] Yeah, again, very clear, thank you. And person
  C? Leah.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Yeah, they're the checker, aren't they? </em>

<em>
  Great, thank you. And if you do need support, what do you need to do? Steve.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Exactly, thank you Steve.”</em>

There are a few things that I want to draw your attention to in the model. Even though this was not the first time they carried out this group work task, I still set out behavioral expectations for the task in some detail. Each pupil knew precisely what they should be doing. I assigned specific roles to each pupil, gave specific instructions, and checked that they understood. I also set clear time boundaries. Giving a finite amount of time helps pupils to stay focused. Finally, I explained that I would circulate during the task. Circulating pupils when they carry out collaborative work gives me a chance to maintain the expectations that I had set out and check to see how I might support pupils.

I also use scaffolds to increase the focus and rigor of pupil dialogue. In this instance, the worksheets with specific errors was one form of scaffold, and another form of scaffold was the fact that the partially completed texts are exemplifying a model dialogue.

When pupils have the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in meaningful talk, and when they are guided by a set of clear behavioural expectations, pair and group work can enable pupils to process their learning in a powerful way.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
Throughout this video we have considered some of the practical ways which teachers
can help their pupils to get the most out of pair and group work. Before we finish,
read over the key ideas that we have covered. Which idea would you prioritize for
your development and why?
<ul>
  <li>Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations</li>
  <li>
    Considering the factors that will support effective collaborative or paired
    work
  </li>
  <li>
    Providing scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of
    dialogue
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
It can be difficult to keep track of learning during pair and group work but
that doesn't mean we should shy away from doing it. Instead, we need to take the
time to set up pair and group work carefully and explicitly teach pupils how to
behave during these types of activities. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Ms Silva can keep pupils on task when they practise independently. There are times when she feels it could be valuable for pupils to work in pairs or groups, but she is frustrated that pupils can go off task or produce poor work when she allows them to talk. How can she manage the way pupils conduct discussions so they get maximum learning benefit from collaboration?

## Key idea

Teachers need to prepare for and intentionally support behaviours that enable quality pupil talk.

## Evidence summary

### Getting pupil behaviour right in talk tasks

At the heart of pair and group work is effective pupil talk. High-quality discussions help pupils better understand what they already know by articulating their thoughts more clearly (EEF, 2018). Peer discussion is also beneficial for building vocabulary, and aids social and linguistic development (Alexander, 2017).

However, when pupils work with their peers it can give rise to behavioural issues, as pupils may get distracted or be unable to complete a task. Just as when introducing other classroom routines, teachers should anticipate and plan to avoid behavioural problems (Kern & Clemens, 2007). To promote on-task talk, Ms Silva can:

- **Outline behavioural expectations:** Where appropriate share specific words to try to use, time limits and rules for turn taking. The EEF (2018) provide an example of rules for discussion.
- **Explain why these behaviours are important:** If pupils know _why_ something is effective, they’re more likely to do it properly and be more motivated to do the hard thinking expected of them (Coe et al., 2014; EEF, 2017).
- **Check understanding:** To succeed, pupils need to understand behavioural expectations and task instructions (Rosenshine, 2012).
- **Practise routines:** Pupils become more automatic and fluent through practice, so Ms Silva can ensure pupils talk successfully by regularly practising talk routines (Rosenshine, 2012).

Ms Silva should pre-plan groupings, as pupil groupings can affect pupil motivation and behaviour (Tereshchenko et al., 2018). She may wish to get pupils to work in pairs first, as this will help pupils to practise routines, behaviours and strategies of discussion, making it more likely pupils will talk successfully before working in larger groups. Once pupils are on task and thinking hard in pairs, she might start to trial group work – but only if she is confident that this will benefit learning. In short, Ms Silva should take an intentional approach to grouping pupils.

### Preparing talk tasks that support pupil learning

As well as getting the behaviour right, Ms Silva needs to ensure pupils have the best chance of learning successfully from talk. Pupils need to understand the goals of the task in relation to their learning. Because we ‘learn what we think hard about’ (Coe, 2013), Ms Silva’s aim should be to get _all_ pupils to think hard about important content during talk tasks. However, Ms Silva needs to balance this with ensuring that her pupils experience success, as this is critical for motivation and learning (Coe et al., 2014; Rosenshine, 2012).

A key factor in ensuring pupils think hard and experience success is teaching in ways that avoid overloading pupil working memory (Dean for Impact, 2015). Ms Silva’s talk tasks are more likely to succeed if she:

- Makes the tasks themselves simple, while keeping the content challenging (Gathercole et al., 2006). For example, using tasks with minimal steps.
- Builds on existing pupil knowledge (Deans for Impact, 2015).
- Provides enough guidance and support, for example, scaffolding (Rosenshine, 2012).

High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary. Knowledgeable pupils are likely to get more insights from discussing their existing knowledge than they could without discussion (Kirschner et al., 2018). Therefore, Ms Silva should consider when in the learning sequence she introduces talk tasks, as they are likely to be more effective _after_ behavioural expectations become embedded and pupil knowledge increases.

### Supporting pupils to manage their learning in talk tasks

Having prepared tasks that support on-task behaviour and learning, how can Ms Silva now manage pupils during talk tasks? She can:

- **Circulate:** Ensuring pupils are on task and not struggling (Rosenshine, 2012).
- **Support:** Directing pupil attention to available scaffolding (Van der Pol et al., 2015).
- **Reinforce:** Using praise, rewards and sanctions to reinforce desired behaviours (IES, 2008).

The preparation Ms Silva has done should support pupils to self-manage their behaviour and learn more effectively. This will allow Ms Silva to focus more on supporting pupil learning and less on managing off-task behaviour during paired and group talk.

### Nuances and caveats

It is best when pupils are taught new knowledge before introducing pair or group work. They may struggle if peer collaboration is introduced too early in the learning sequence.

While it is possible for teachers to pick up on pupil misconceptions during pupil discussions, this is not likely to be the quickest or most efficient way of checking for understanding: strong whole-class questioning might be more effective. Discussions are best used to help pupils organise their knowledge.

Ability grouping shows limited evidence of impact on pupil outcomes (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Silva must ensure the groups pupils are placed in don’t negatively affect pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation. Ms Silva should ensure her within-class pupil groups are flexible and that she continuously considers whether pupils are in a group because this is an effective way of tailoring support for an identified pupil need e.g. ensuring groups based on attainment are subject specific and changing groups regularly, avoiding the perception that groups are fixed.

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Ms Silva can support talk that enables effective pair and group work by
  understanding that:
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      There are behavioural challenges particular to group and paired work.
      Teachers can pre-empt them by pre-planning groupings, and sharing and
      checking behavioural expectations and practice.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Effective talk tasks support pupils to talk successfully if they avoid
      overloading pupil working memory so pupils can articulate key ideas,
      consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.
    </span>

  <span class="s1">Presenter intro: Peps McCrea</span>
</h3>
The goals that teachers set for their pupils have a huge impact on what they achieve.
If we want our pupils to experience success at school and beyond, it's crucial that
teachers have high expectations, both for behaviour and academic success. But just
setting high expectations alone isn't enough. Teachers also need to show pupils how
they can meet them.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Teachers can have a massive influence over their pupils. The expectations that teachers
set for their pupils can shape the outcomes that they achieve both in school and
beyond, and not just in terms of academic success. Teachers have the ability to affect
and improve pupil wellbeing, motivation, and behaviour. In order to achieve the best
for our pupils, we need to set high expectations, both of academic success and behaviour,
and support our pupils to get there. This is true for all pupils, whatever their
starting point.

High expectations for pupil behaviour can include a wide range of behaviours, such as being polite and respectful to each other, contributing to class discussions, working silently when asked, persevering during a challenging task. Some of these behaviours will be more obvious than others. Some pupils will arrive into your classroom being good at some and not others. But for every expectation that teachers set for their pupils, teachers need to show pupils how to achieve it.

In the first instance, manageable instructions, explicitly describing behavioural expectations and highlighting them through positive reinforcement helps pupils to meet high expectations. When pupils have done something that you have asked, such as placing their books in a neat pile, or answering in a full sentence once they have discussed an idea with a partner, acknowledging this positive behaviour can encourage others to do the same. When pupils exceed your expectations, such as being especially kind to a fellow pupil, or building on someone else's idea in a nuanced way, teachers can praise their pupils.

Another approach that can help pupils to achieve high expectations is to draw their attention to the behaviours that they have demonstrated. For example, to encourage a pupil to share their thinking, even if it is wrong, a teacher might remind the class that they have been brave enough to do this in the past and felt proud of themselves when they did so. Pupils can get better at regulating their behaviour when we help them to know how to respond to different situations.

Using intentional and aspirational language, and encouraging effort, also helps to create a classroom culture where pupils become used to working hard and trying their best. Pupils need to experience success in the classroom to feel they're capable of it. This means setting tasks that stretch pupils, and being explicit about the knowledge and skills that they need to acquire in order to carry out these tasks well. Once again, it's about showing pupils how to be successful, not simply setting your expectations high and hoping for the best. Powerful motivating words need to be accompanied by crystal-clear actions.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to establish high expectations during
a class discussion. Try to spot the following:
<ul>
  <li>Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations</li>
  <li>Acknowledges and praises pupil effort</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
For the purposes of this model, I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year
seven English class "Romeo and Juliet." I'm about to ask a series of questions
to help consolidate and develop pupil thinking. My expectation is that everyone
should be willing to answer.

<em>
  “In a moment, we're going to be recalling some of the new vocabulary and ideas
  we learned about Romeo in the last lesson, and I'm going to be asking you to
  look for examples in the scene that we just read. Now, remember when I ask a
  question, I expect everybody to be thinking of the answer, because if you do
  that, it's going to help this new vocabulary stick, and you're going to be
  able to use it in your writing later on in the lesson. So what does the word
  rash mean? This is one of the words we looked at last lesson so I want
  everyone to be thinking carefully. What does the word rash mean? Oliver.
</em>

<em>[Pupil says they don’t know]</em>

<em>
   Okay. It's okay if you can't remember. I'm going to ask the question again,
  and Oliver, I want you to be listening carefully because I'm coming back to
  you, okay? What does the word rash mean, Elwin?
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>

<em>Great, good definition. So Oliver, what does the word rash mean? </em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>

<em>
  Thank you, Oliver. Okay, so what might an example of rash behaviour look like?
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives answer]</em>

<em>
  Great. So rash behaviour is doing something quickly without thinking through
  the consequences, which are often negative. Okay everybody, I want you to scan
  your texts and find an example of Romeo behaving rashly. Okay, Sarah.
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>

<em>
  A great example. Can you explain why that's a strong example of Romeo behaving
  rashly?
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>

<em>
  That's a brilliant justification. You clearly thought about the definition of
  the word rash because you've picked a strong quotation and you were able to
  justify it in your own words.”
</em>

In this example, there are a range of strategies that I've used to ensure that I maintain my high expectations of my class. I supported pupils to master challenging content. In this case, that meant acquiring a thorough understanding of a tier two word: rash. The support included reminding them of their prior knowledge, we looked at this word last week, providing a clear definition, and asking the pupil to provide a concrete example. These small steps help pupils to access the more challenging part of the task: identifying an example of rash behaviour in the text.

I encouraged all pupils to participate by asking the question to the whole class and pausing to allow them to all think before calling on one pupil. By naming a pupil after I've asked the question, rather than before, I'm keeping my options open for longer. Pupils are more likely to think about the answer as they may be called on. This is a routine that I've embedded with the class, and so pupils know what to expect.

Finally, I helped pupils to experience success through their contributions. When Oliver didn't know the answer to the question, I asked another pupil, and then went back to Oliver to give him the chance to correct his thinking. This provided a great opportunity to remind Oliver and others of their ability to make progress. Pupils benefit when we help them to attribute successes to their efforts rather than to any innate ability.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we've explored why it's important for teachers to have high expectations,
and how they can help pupils to achieve them. Now read over the key ideas that we've
covered. Which ideas do you think the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations</li>
  <li>
    Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards
    long-term goals
  </li>
  <li>
    Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
You may well have seen some teachers who make setting high expectations look
easy. Pupil behaviour is exemplary in their classrooms, and they appear to have
some kind of magic touch. But none of this is really magic. Helping pupils to
meet high expectations for behaviour as well as academic success occurs when
teachers consistently show their pupils what to do. It's about being explicit to
pupils, and constantly reinforcing what we say.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Mahrez has been working hard on conveying high expectations in her classroom, encouraging pupils to try hard and be open to challenge. However, she still occasionally struggles with low-level disruption and worries that her expectations may be unrealistic. On the other hand, when she looks at experienced colleagues’ classrooms, they seem to achieve better behaviour and learning from the same pupils. What role do high expectations play in pupil success and how can Ms Mahrez build a classroom that consistently delivers high expectations?

## Key idea

Teachers can uphold high expectations by ensuring pupils are supported to achieve classroom success over time.

## Evidence summary

### The role of teacher support in pupil success

Ms Mahrez is determined to uphold high expectations but she worries that there is a gap between her ambitions and what her pupils can achieve. To close this gap, one of the most important things Ms Mahrez can do is create a learning environment where pupils experience a high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012). Over time, pupil success can unlock the other learning behaviours Ms Mahrez seeks to promote.

To promote pupil success, Ms Mahrez’s classroom should demand a lot of pupils, but should also support pupils to meet these demands. To help with this, she can:

- Celebrate pupil resilience to failures along the way.
- Encourage pupils to attribute successes to their efforts and smart strategies rather than any innate ‘ability’ (Coe et al., 2014).

Ms Mahrez’s role in securing success is partly about ensuring pupils have enough support, particularly with challenging tasks. If support is absent, pupils may fail to meet Ms Mahrez’s high expectations which may damage pupil perceptions of self-worth. She also needs to take care not to inadvertently communicate low expectations, for example by setting tasks which are too easy, or by over-praising pupils for simply meeting expectations (Coe et al., 2014). Promoting success, including proactively highlighting success to parents and carers, will also improve pupil-teacher relationships as these are based on repeated interactions over time (Wubbels et al., 2014).

### Supporting pupils to develop effective learning behaviours

Supporting success in this way also leads to pupils exhibiting more effective approaches to their learning. For example:\*\*\*\*

- **Increased effort and confidence:** Pupils’ perception of their ability, their expectations of future success and the extent to which they value an activity, influence their motivation and persistence, making improved academic outcomes more likely. This may be particularly important for low-attaining pupils who may have had limited experiences of success in the past (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).
- **Growing intrinsic motivation:** ‘Extrinsic’ rewards like praise for pupils who are willing to try a difficult task can be useful to get pupils started. However, where pupils are motivated ‘intrinsically’ by their own goals (and the believe they can achieve them), pupils will be more persistent in the long term (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).

In sum, success over time supports the development of pupil effort, self-belief and intrinsic motivation which, in turn, drives further classroom success in a virtuous classroom cycle.

Ms Mahrez can also help pupils to understand and consciously cultivate these effective learning behaviours. Research suggests pupils can get better at self-regulating their behaviours and emotions (EEF, 2017), and pupils who do so are likely to attain more highly and succeed in the future (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). For example, if pupils can identify the behaviours that underpin their success (such as perseverance), they can regulate emotional barriers (like impatience) that can prevent them from being successful. This makes it more likely they stay on task, which is a strong predictor of successful learning (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010).

Finally, pupils are influenced by the goals, values and behaviours of classmates (IES, 2008; Rathmann et al., 2018). Over time, individual pupils adopting effective behaviours can also create a classroom climate that promotes success for their peers.

### The long-term impacts of high teacher expectations

Ms Mahrez is aware that her expectations are important for classroom behaviour (IES, 2008) and learning (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). Teacher expectations influence whether pupils experience an effective classroom, where there is both the support and challenge to succeed at goals that stretch pupils (Coe et al. 2014). Also, teachers who add most value to academic outcomes also support pupil success beyond the classroom. Having an effective teacher, likely one who holds these high expectations, is also a factor making it more likely pupils will experience other forms of future success, including:

- Attending university.
- Earning a higher salary.
- Avoiding having children as a teenager (Chetty, Friedman & Rockoff, 2014).

Pupils who perceive that their teachers are in control of the class and include them in activities are also more likely to feel satisfied in life and have better school outcomes (Rathmann et al., 2018). Moreover, lower-achieving pupils appear to benefit most from effective teaching (Slater et al., 2011). Ms Mahrez should be ambitious in her expectations for her pupils within her classroom. By developing her effectiveness as a teacher, she can be confident that she is also setting pupils up for wider success. In time, this should lead pupils to also have higher expectations of themselves.

### Nuances and caveats

Being an effective teacher requires strong knowledge of effective instruction and the subject being taught (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Mahrez needs to develop her practice in relation to the instruction and subject strands of this programme to have the best chance of translating high expectations into successful learning behaviours.

Conveying and upholding high expectations takes significant teacher effort and time. Improvements in pupil attitudes to learning may not be immediately visible, and there may be steps backwards as well as forwards. Ms Mahrez may feel like her colleagues’ classrooms work as if by magic, but she needs to understand there is no shortcut. Her consistent efforts to support pupil success, and helping them understand the process behind this, is the best way she can support pupils in her classroom and set them up for success beyond it.

<h3>Presenter: Helena Moore</h3>
This strand is all about instruction. By instruction, we mean anything that teachers
and pupils do in the classroom that is meant to get them to learn. Getting instruction
right is hard, but it often boils down to what teachers know, and how they put that
knowledge into practice in their classrooms. The best teachers know their pupils,
they know what they're teaching, and they know how to help their pupils learn those
things.

But just knowing isn't enough. Great teachers put that knowledge into practice in their classrooms, they're continually assessing their pupils to see if they understand and they adapt all the time to help their pupils learn. So there's a lot there, but the evidence is pretty clear that people can become great at instruction and we've put a lot of thought into designing resources that are going to help you to keep getting better.

<h3>Presenter: Melanie Hooson</h3>
It doesn't feel very controversial to say that effective instruction ensures that
pupils learn what we teach them. But what we mean by learning? Over the decades,
psychologists have come up with various definitions of learning, but perhaps the
one that's most useful for teachers is this: learning involves a lasting change in
pupils' capabilities and understanding.

When we understand the importance of getting pupils to remember what we teach them, it makes sense to think about how memory works. Memory is where people's process and remember what we teach them, it is fundamental to learning and instruction. Getting to know how memory works will help teachers design instructional practices that help them to retain what we teach them in the long term. In other words, it will help pupils to learn.

If I wanted a teacher to understand how to teach in a way that will help pupils to learn, I would tell them to start with these three things. Number one: learn about a simple model of memory, including working memory and long-term memory. Number two: learn about how our memory store information in mental models. And number three: learn about explicit teaching. This is a form of teaching that takes advantage of the strengths of how our memories work and reduces the impact of their limitations.

Most of the experienced teachers I've worked with, have had to identify the kind of practices that really help their pupils learn mostly through trial and error. I think the model of memory and learning are so central to developing as a new teacher because it will help you to fast track through those experiences and help your pupils to find success much more quickly than you would on your own.

<h3>Presenter: Helena Moore</h3>
In this strand, you will explore the foundations of effective instruction and the
link to how pupils learn. You will consider how to guide pupils' learning via an
explicit teaching approach, and you will learn some specific strategies that can
be applied across a sequence of learning.

Each module will include a weekly video. The purpose of the videos is to give you a broad understanding of the module and a concrete example of what some of the ideas look like in practice. The videos draw on the same research base as the evidence summaries and illustrate some of the action steps that you may encounter in your weekly coaching.

One thing to remember, is that whilst the models in the video will show an aspect of what you learn about that week, they cannot show all of it. One example alone would never be enough to cover everything that the module does. To get the best out of these videos, pay attention to the key ideas that we highlight. It might be a different subject or phase to the one that you teach, but these videos have been carefully curated to ensure they demonstrate key ideas. These key ideas are relevant across all subjects and all phases.

## Read | Strand introduction

Welcome to the _Instruction_ strand of the programme. This strand is composed of 12 modules and has been designed to last roughly a term. It is best completed during your second term as an NQT – typically the spring term.

By the end of this strand you will have an evidence-informed understanding of:

- The link between effective instruction and pupil learning.
- The elements of explicit instruction and the ‘I-We-You' model as a useful way of approaching this.
- How instruction can support more effective pupil thinking.

This programme has been designed to ensure that teachers develop a holistic understanding of effective teaching so, while the Instruction strand is mostly about instruction, it also incorporates insights from Behaviour and Subject, as these are also important to support pupil learning. When we say ‘instruction’ we mean the combination of teaching and learning, rather than just teacher input. We therefore define instruction as “any activity that is intended to create learning” (Wiliam & Black, 2009).

Furthermore, you’ll notice that as the strand progresses modules will often touch on previously learned content. This is intentional and a crucial aspect of your learning experience. Some concepts on the programme are so important that they need to be revisited multiple times, to ensure you develop a deep and durable understanding.

This strand comprises 12 modules sequenced to work through the foundations of effective instruction, its elements and how they support effective pupil learning, and then considers more complex instructional approaches.

- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective instruction.
- **Modules 2-3** cover the links between effective instruction and pupil learning.
- **Modules 5-8** cover the elements of effective instruction and their links to an explicit teaching approach.
- **Modules 8-12** explore more complex ideas around certain practices that can support even _more_ effective learning, incorporating and building on previous modules.

### Making it work

The features of effective instruction can vary slightly depending on the subject(s), phase(s) or community you teach. In addition, there are some elements of instruction, like the school teaching and learning policy, that you will have limited control over. This is why it’s important that you work with subject and phase specialists in your school to help you identify the best ways to apply your learning. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to support. Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter, as well as seeking their assistance, challenge, feedback and critique, will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context.

The evidence cited in the strand draws primarily from research on:

- Cognitive science.
- Classroom practices of effective teachers.

You might have come across some of the terminology explored before. However, some of the technical language used, particularly around cognitive science, may be new to you. Several key terms are explored further in the evidence summary below.

### A reminder of the programme pattern

Having worked through Behaviour, you will be familiar with how each week is structured. Instruction follows the same pattern for each module:

- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.
- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read, relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.
- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.
- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.

Year one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF.

Now that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.

## I1 | Strand overview

### Teaching challenge

Ms Brophy is increasingly confident in her behaviour management. She’s supported with pre-prepared schemes of work and lesson plans but sometimes struggles to make them work in her classroom. Pupils can become confused about what she wants them to do or struggle to remember what she has taught them. How can Ms Brophy make instructional decisions that maximise the learning of her class?

### Key idea

Making effective instructional decisions help lessons to go better and pupils to learn more.

### Evidence summary

#### Learning

Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. Ms Brophy wants to ensure that pupils are able to remember what they learn. She also wants her pupils to be able to think creatively and problem solve. To be successful, she needs to understand the foundational role of ‘memory’ in learning.

#### A model of memory

An important factor in successful learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory. Willingham’s simple model of memory is one way to represent visually how the components relate to each other:

$Figure
$Alt Daniel Willingham’s simple model of memory which shows how information from the environment is processed by the working memory (the site of awareness and thinking) to create changes to long-term memory (factual and procedural knowledge), whilst recognising that forgetting can also occur. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/diagram-1.png $EndURL $Caption Simple model of memory (Willingham, 2009) $EndCaption
$EndFigure

The main components in this model are:

- **Working memory** which acts as the conduit between the information we attend to in our environment and our long-term memory (Sweller, 2016). It is also where we hold information we are thinking about in the moment (Willingham, 2009). It has a limited capacity: we can only think about a few things (two or three) at once (Cowan, 2008).
- **Long-term memory** which can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn. This store of knowledge integrates new ideas with existing knowledge. We can also draw on knowledge from our long-term memory to support the processing of new information in working memory (Willingham, 2009). The capacity of long-term memory is vast (Cowan, 2008).

#### Mental models

Simply giving pupils knowledge is not enough. Ms Brophy needs to make the knowledge useable, for example by connecting new knowledge to existing pupil knowledge. Mental models -- sometimes referred to as schema -- are how we all organise our knowledge. They are an internal representation of concepts (for example Earth) or a set of interrelated concepts (for example the circulatory system) (Chi, 2009). Mental models are subject and topic specific, so to be successful Ms Brophy will also need to consider how to develop and convey subject knowledge to her pupils in the Subject strand.

#### Managing cognitive load

Teachers can change pupils’ capabilities and understanding by increasing the knowledge in pupil long-term memory and constructing useful and well organised mental models (Sweller et al., 1998). However, when teaching, Ms Brophy notices that some of her pupils struggle when being introduced to new material. A key reason for this may be that their working memories are being overloaded.

The capacity of our working memory is limited. Complex activities that place a heavy burden on either processing or storage capacity can place excessive demands on working memory and are therefore likely overload the system, resulting in task failure (Gathercole et al., 2006). Cognitive load refers to the amount of effort needed to process information in working memory (Sweller et al., 1998). Teachers like Ms Brophy need to manage the cognitive load pupils experience so that they can learn efficiently. She needs to ensure pupils experience enough new material to learn effectively but not too much, otherwise pupils working memory will become overloaded. She can do this through the instructional decisions she makes.

#### Drawing on prior knowledge

One way which Ms Brophy can manage the cognitive load her pupils experience is by drawing on their prior knowledge. The more prior knowledge pupils hold, the easier it is for them to process new information. Prior knowledge also plays a role in the development of their mental models, as existing pupils’ knowledge influences how new knowledge is stored and organised (Deans for Impact, 2015).

Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions (Simonsmeier et al., 2018). This particularly applies if new ideas are not introduced in manageable steps. Ms Brophy knows that pupils will have different levels of prior knowledge and many will also hold misconceptions. On the other hand, as pupil knowledge develops, teachers needs to reduce the support pupils receive, as support can get in the way of pupils using existing knowledge (Sweller et al., 1998). Therefore, Ms Brophy will need to consider how much prior knowledge pupils have when making instructional decisions.

#### Mitigating extraneous load

Because working memory has a limited capacity, Ms Brophy needs to be intentional in how she introduces and explains content to her pupils. Extraneous load refers to ways in which instruction can make processing information unhelpfully challenging for pupils (for example, giving complicated instructions to pupils who have limited prior knowledge, or redundant support to pupils who already have sufficient knowledge; Sweller, 2016). Ms Brophy can reduce extraneous load through the instructional decisions she makes.

#### Explicit teaching

As we have seen, in order to ensure her pupils learn effectively, when making decisions about her instruction Ms Brophy needs to consider the limits of pupil memory. The knowledge Ms Brophy wants to teach is complex – in _Subject_ she will consider how to develop her subject knowledge and what habits might support her to plan her own lessons. Initially, she should work with her mentor to get shared schemes of work and lesson plans to help her to identify and sequence relevant knowledge. For pupils to successfully learn this material, she needs to explicitly teach her pupils (Sweller, 2016).

_Explicit teaching_ is a heavily ‘guided’ approach to orchestrating learning (EEF, 2017), in contrast to just letting pupils attempt to ‘discover’ new ideas by themselves. In general, less guided approaches to learning, such as discovery learning, have been shown to be ineffective (Coe et al., 2014). This doesn’t mean the teacher simply tells or lectures pupils; it can also include activities and discussion, as long as the relevant information is explicitly provided and practised. Successful explicit teaching breaks down learning, and provides pupils with the support needed to think successfully about content by taking into account:

- The limits of working memory.
- The complexity of the material to be taught.
- The prior knowledge that pupils have.

#### I-We-You

One suggested way to implement explicit teaching is to follow an ‘I do’, ‘We do’ then ‘You do’ approach (Lemov, 2015). I-We-You is a rule of thumb Ms Brophy can use to make decisions about her instruction. It involves reducing support over time so that pupils can increasingly accessing content independently. Fundamental to effective instruction is maintaining a high success rate while reducing this support as pupils’ knowledge increases (Rosenshine, 2012).

#### ‘I do’

The ‘I do’ refers to the early stages of learning where the teacher provides new information by modelling and/or explaining the facts and processes which pupils are to learn. Effective teachers ensure that pupils acquire, rehearse and connect knowledge by providing a good deal of instructional support. Pupils can go on to more independent activities but only after basic material is learned (Rosenshine, 2012).

There are numerous ways Ms Brophy’s ‘I do’ can explicitly convey content, including:

- Explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned (Deans for Impact, 2015).
- Explaining new concepts (such explanations are less effective for processes: Wittwer & Renkl, 2010).
- Introducing materials in steps.
- Modelling new processes and ideas (Rosenshine, 2012).
- Providing concrete examples and worked examples of new problems (Pashler et al., 2007).

There are a variety of instructional strategies Ms Brophy can use to support her pupils when introducing new material. These supports are referred to as scaffolds. A scaffold is a temporary aid used to support pupils with their learning (Rosenshine, 2012). Just as with scaffolds around a house, they help us to reach areas which on our own we would struggle to get to. Once they have served their purpose, however, it is important they are removed.

#### ‘We do’

The ‘We do’ is the ‘guided practice’ part of instruction where pupils gradually complete examples with less and less support on more and more of the task.

Ms Brophy has introduced her new material in small steps and provided scaffolds, such as modelling or worked examples, to support her pupils’ thinking. Because pupils learn at different rates and have different levels of prior knowledge, Ms Brophy knows that they will require different levels and types of targeted support.

She wants her pupils to grasp foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on. Questioning is an important tool for teachers to master which can be used to foster thinking and check pupil understanding (Coe et al., 2014). Furthermore, it can enable teachers to be responsive and better target support to pupils who are struggling (Black & Wiliam, 2009). Once she has used questioning to identify pupils, Ms Brophy could give more targeted input or regroup them so she can better support them.

#### ‘You do’

The ‘You do’ is the ‘independent practice’ part of the lesson, where pupils practise tasks of increasing difficulty on their own.

Over time, Ms Brophy wants to ensure that she provides her pupils with regular purposeful practice and the opportunity to retrieve information from memory. Practice is essential, but not all practice is equal (Deans for Impact, 2015). She needs to ensure her pupils think hard and provide enough scaffolding and feedback to ensure they achieve a high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012). Practice could be even more effective if it includes:

- Spacing so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap.
- Low-stakes quizzes to retrieve key content (Pashler et. al, 2007).

Effective practice supports automaticity and overlearning where pupils can complete tasks fluently without drawing on their working memory, freeing them to focus on more complex tasks (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, learning their times tables allows pupils to grapple with more complex long multiplication and division. Therefore, pupils need to practise beyond the point where they get something right to the point when they can no longer get it wrong.

#### Homework

Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils. But to be effective it needs to be of high quality and relevant to what is being taught in class (EEF, 2018). Considering the link to the instructional sequence above could increase the chance of homework being successful. For example, asking pupils to do further practise of something which has been taught in class, or perhaps reading with a parent to introduce a new idea that will be built upon in class. Making the purpose of the homework clear to pupils, ensuring that pupils have the resources to complete homework independently or that parents have the capacity to support homework effectively, are also likely to increase chances of success. It is also important that pupils get feedback on their homework. On the other hand, regular homework unconnected to class learning is less likely to be effective (EEF, 2018).

#### Refining instruction

As Ms Brophy improves at explicit teaching and develops her subject knowledge, various strategies can further refine her instructional decision making:

|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Questioning** | Effective instruction checks for understanding and extends pupil thinking (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Brophy can refine her questioning to ensure she gets quality answers from her pupils, helping her to decide whether to revisit content or go deeper into topics.                                                                                                           |
| **Talk**        | Pupils can refine their understanding and gain new insights from their knowledge through effective peer talk (Jay et al. 2017; Kirschner et al., 2018). Ms Brophy needs to check whether pupils have enough knowledge to talk effectively and use her instruction to facilitate successful talk.                                                                            |
| **Feedback**    | Good quality feedback is one the best-evidenced and most effective ways to improve pupil progress (EEF, 2018). Ms Brophy needs to practise ‘decision-driven data collection’: considering what kind of feedback she has the capacity to give and pupils have the capacity to act upon, and how she can do this in a way which supports pupils to manage their own learning. |

Throughout the* Instruction* strand Ms Brophy needs to keep two questions in mind:

- How can my instructional decisions best support pupil learning?
- How can I best support a high pupil success rate?

#### Nuances and caveats

A common misconception is that I-We-You should only be used in individual lessons. In fact, I-We-You can be used several times within a lesson, or spread over longer instructional sequences.

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
How we teach affects what pupils learn and there are important principles about instruction
that are relevant across phases and subjects. But in order to make sense of these
principles and be able to use them well, teachers need to have a detailed understanding
of what they are teaching. Before we think about how to teach, we need to know what
to teach. And the first step in instruction is to identify the learning content.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Pupils need to think hard about something in order to learn it and lesson time is
precious. Teachers need to have a clear understanding of what they want their pupils
to think about. And this is what we mean by identifying the learning content.

Identifying the learning content involves identifying what you want your pupils to know and be able to do at the end of the sequence of learning. Once you have this clear and specific idea of what pupils need to learn, you can check to see what content pupils may already know or may have misconceptions about. Clarity over learning content can make teaching easier and increases the likelihood of success.

There are several ways you might identify learning content. One approach is to look at the learning goals and use your own knowledge of the subject to break this down into more granular pieces of content. If a lesson objective or intention states that pupils should learn about the foundations of ancient Rome, what specific content sits within this? You might say, <em>"I want my pupils to know that ancient Rome was founded on the banks of the River Tiber.”</em> Another approach is to complete the task that pupils would do at the end of a sequence of learning. For example, write a paragraph, giving your opinion on whether the opening of a multinational fast-food chain had a positive or negative impact on Nigeria. Or if you're in an earlier setting, you might want pupils to use a range of vocabulary to talk about the different farmyard animals during small world play. Once you have this concrete example, you can unpack the knowledge and skills that are required. You might identify more specific words to introduce to pupils so that they can add them to their play. Words like snout or trotter. Completing an unpicking a task is likely to reveal some content that pupils already have and some content that is going to be new to them.

Lesson objectives, units of work, and the national curriculum can be helpful in guiding you about what to teach, but the knowledge and skills required will change depending on the content that you're teaching and who you are teaching. Completing tasks allows teachers to see the specific details that sit within them. Think about this objective:

<ol>
  <li>Which is bigger 3/7 or 5/7?</li>
  <li>Which is bigger 5/7 or 5/9?</li>
</ol>
What specific knowledge and skills do they require? These tasks appear similar, but
when you break them down, you see that they require different knowledge and skills.
In the first, pupils will need to know about fractions with a shared denominator,
along with other foundational content about number. In the second, pupils will need
to know about fractions with different denominators. Teachers need to know the detail
of what they are teaching so that they can pinpoint what it is that pupils need to
learn.

Once you've identified what you want your pupils to learn in a lesson, it is important to check that what you're asking of them is manageable. Teachers can make learning manageable by ensuring they build on what pupils already know, break content down into smaller chunks, or identify the essential idea within more complex concepts, being wary of embedding misconceptions when they do this.

Having thought really carefully about what pupils will be learning in the lesson, teachers then need to design a way of quickly assessing for it. An exit task is one effective way of doing this. A good exit task tests for the most important content within a lesson. Pupils need to be able to compete it quickly, and teachers should be able to assess it quickly. It can't assess all the content in the lesson. Instead, it should focus on the content that pupils need to learn before they move on. The better teachers identify the learning content of the lesson, the better they will know what to test for.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, we're going to see an early career teacher working with their
coach. It is a primary setting and the teacher is preparing a lesson of the year
six class. The unit of work is rainforests and the teacher's preparing a lesson about
where the Amazon rainforest is located. As you listen, pay particular attention to
how the teacher and the coach do the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the
    subject
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>
<em>
  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So in this lesson, we want pupil to learn about
  where the Amazon rainforest is located. And we can see it's the third lesson
  in the unit about rainforests and pupil should be building their understanding
  of what a rainforest is.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So this unit is all about understanding why rainforests matter, which links to
  that key theme of sustainability that they've been learning about from year
  one to year six. Pupils need that really strong understanding of what the
  rainforest is if they're to understand why the rainforest is so important and
  some of those threats to the rainforest such as deforestation.{" "}

  At the end of lesson task we can see is to mould sourdough in the shape of the
  Amazon rainforest over a map of South America. The aim is to get pupils to
  really understand how big the rainforest is and to know which countries it
  covers. They then have to place a cocktail stick with the name of the country,
  into the sourdough on the map, in the correct place. They're then going to
  mark where the Amazon river flows into the sourdough.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I know you've read the scheme of work really carefully, and you've completed
  the end of lesson task. So now let's get a bit more specific. What knowledge
  and skills do you need pupils to know by the end of the lesson?
</em>

<em>
  ECT (PAULA DELANEY): So by the end of the lesson, I want pupils to be able to
  name the Amazon river. I want them to know the countries where the Amazon
  rainforest is located. I want them to really understand the size of the
  rainforest as well. And skills wise, I want them to be able to read the Atlas.
</em>

<em>
   COACH: Great you've listed lots of important content, I would add that pupils
  need to know the Amazon rainforest is located in nine different countries and
  know some of their names. To make it manageable, focus first on these three
  countries: Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela as this is where the majority of
  the Amazon rainforest is located. You will also need pupils to know some of
  the core knowledge about the rainforest. So you need them to know if it's
  close to the equator line, the climate's hot and humid, there's lots of
  rainfall and that it's a habitat for lots of plants and animals. This is what
  pupils have been learning about in previous lessons so it should be part of
  their prior knowledge. As for the skills let's break down the scale of reading
  an Atlas into something a little bit more specific. So reading an Atlas can
  involve lots of different things. Could you be more specific?
</em>

<em>
  ECT: Yes, I want them to be able to locate certain countries in the map.
</em>

<em>
   COACH: Great, we could go further and add that we want pupils to be able to
  locate a compass on a map and use compass points to locate a country. We could
  just tell pupils that on an Atlas, the top of the page is always North. But in
  year one, they learn those four compass points, so it'd be good for them to
  have a chance to recall and strengthen that knowledge.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  This is a really detailed list of knowledge and skills that we've got. What do
  you think the most important knowledge is that they need to take away from the
  lesson?
</em>

<em>
  ECT: Essentially, I really want them to see how big the Amazon rainforest is
  and how many people's live are actually impacted by it.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: Definitely, so first, pupils will learn what the rainforest is and then
  they'll build upon that knowledge to learn about deforestation, which is that
  key issue within the theme of sustainability. This lesson gives pupils a
  concrete opportunity to see how big the Amazon rainforest is. They'll build
  upon this in future lessons when they explore how many people the Amazon
  rainforest supports, why deforestation is a problem and why sustainability
  matters.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  If pupils don't understand how big the rainforest is, they'll find it hard to
  understand deforestation and sustainability. This is one of the most important
  things they'll need to take away from the lesson. So you'll need to draw their
  attention to it and check they've really understood it.
</em>
<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
In this example, the teacher and that coach spent the majority of their time
identifying in detail, the essential concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils
needed to learn in a lesson. The lesson was precise and concrete. The Amazon
rainforest is close to the equator. It's located in nine different countries.
They also made sure that the learning was manageable by building on what pupils
already knew. In this case, about what a rainforest is. And they broke down some
content into smaller chunks: being able to locate a country on a map rather than
the larger scale of being able to read an atlas.

They used knowledge of the unit of work to know what the really important content was, like the size of the Amazon rainforest, and they prioritised content that would help pupils to achieve the end goals of the unit. In this case, understanding why rainforest matter. Having thought really hard about what they were teaching, the teacher was able to identify what content they would test for at the end of the lesson fairly quickly.

The time that the teacher and their coach spent in identifying the learning content is likely to speed up the rest of their planning and make their lesson more effective.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
Identifying the learning content means thinking hard about what you're teaching.
How much time do you currently spend on this? Before we finish, remind yourself of
the key ideas that we've covered in this video. Which of these ideas will you focus
on first?
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject
    you are teaching.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical
    components.
  </li>
  <li>Plan formative assessment tasks linked to lesson tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Identifying the learning content is a rewarding task, but it's demanding too. We
often underestimate the knowledge and skills required and it can be especially
difficult if you haven't taught the lesson or unit before. I'd highly recommend
doing this task with someone who knows the content and the subject well.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Stones wants to ensure pupils experience maximum learning in each lesson. She knows she needs to challenge pupils with new learning content but is unsure how to decide the right amount of content to do this. How could she identify and divide up content, and check if learning is taking place? How can she adapt others' plans for her own classes to achieve this?

## Key idea

Teachers can ensure pupils experience maximum learning by carefully identifying the content that pupils will think hard about at different points in a lesson, breaking this thinking down and checking learning along the way.

## Evidence summary

### Identifying key thinking in a lesson

Learning involves processes leading to a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding – if nothing changes, arguably nothing has been learned (Sweller, 2016). As time in lesson is limited, Ms Stones needs to prioritise a manageable amount of content for her pupils to learn about. Learning takes place when pupils think hard about something (Coe, 2013) so Ms Stones should consider and carefully specify what she wants her pupils to think hard about in each lesson.

### Breaking down learning

Like all of us, pupils find new academic ideas difficult, and will often avoid thinking hard wherever possible (Willingham, 2009). Pupils may also avoid tasks where they fear they will be unsuccessful (Kluger & deNisi, 1996). Ms Stones can help her pupils by breaking learning down, making thinking more manageable.

When learning is manageable, pupils will achieve a higher success rate. Effective teachers break learning down to make it more manageable by:

- Introducing new material in small steps.
- Sharing models (including solved problems) to illustrate each step.
- Asking lots of questions and guiding pupils to practise each step successfully.

To support a high success rate, instruction should be aligned at different stages of teaching. For example, making sure that pupils practise the same material that has been introduced to them (Rosenshine, 2012). Therefore, when selecting the content pupils must think hard about, Ms Stones needs to consider, ”what thinking do I want pupils to be successful with?” and ”how can I break this thinking down to make success more likely?”

However, selecting appropriate steps is hard. Sometimes a step that will improve a final performance does not look like the final performance (Christodoulou, 2017). For example, a violinist might practise their scales to be fluent before attempting to improve at playing a piece, rather than just repeating the piece. Similarly, pupils might need to practise their vocabulary before attempting an essay. Ms Stones should seek support from her mentor and colleagues when breaking learning down into essential material – concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – that she wishes pupils to think about and remember.

Ms Stones wants to support a high success rate, so she also needs to understand how manageable pupils are finding the steps she has selected. However, predicting how manageable steps are can be uncertain. For example, how manageable a step is can depend on pupil prior knowledge (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, even if Ms Stones has carefully broken learning down, with support from colleagues, she still needs to assess pupils to check how successful they have been with each step.

### Checking key learning

Effective teachers regularly review learning, asking lots of questions which check pupil understanding (Rosenshine, 2012). The more precisely Ms Stones has identified what she wants pupils to be thinking hard about at various stages of the lessons, the more effectively she will be able to check for key learning. She needs to check the learning of as many pupils as possible.

Ms Stones wants to establish where all learners are in relation to the key content or steps she wants pupils to succeed at. An effective strategy for checking whole-class understanding of identified content is the use of ‘exit tickets’. This is an end of lesson assessment that pupils need to be able to complete quickly and that teachers should be able to assess quickly. Getting every pupil to complete an exit ticket as a low-stakes assessment at the end of her lessons will help Ms Stones to gauge how successful pupils have been with these steps.

Ms Stones’ assessment may pick up that pupils are not yet secure in their thinking about a particular step, for example if several pupils incorrectly answer a question or there is a common misconception or error in an exit ticket. If the success rate drops, Ms Stones should provide further support, for example breaking the learning steps down further in the next lesson.

### Nuances and caveats

One approach to breaking learning down could be to set steps which pupils can already easily do, to ensure success. However, setting easy work might suggest the teacher has low expectations, which is likely to negatively affect pupil confidence and motivation (Coe et al., 2014). Furthermore, if pupils are not set challenging enough tasks, they will not learn as much.

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>A key goal for all teachers is to help their
pupils to learn and remember what they learn. The good news is that we know a lot
about how learning works and the role that memory plays. Memory is an important factor
in learning. It affects our ability to pay attention to something, to remember it,
and to use it. Teachers need to know about the role that memory plays in learning
and design lessons that maximize its potential.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Understanding a bit about how our memories work can help us to make better decisions
in our teaching. Whilst there's still a lot that we don't know, cognitive scientists
have learned a huge amount about how our brains process and store information. Teachers
need to know this too. The following simple model of memory, devised by Professor
of Psychology, Daniel Willingham, can tell us a lot about how learning works.

The model starts with the environment. There are thousands of things in the environment that you could pay attention to. You might pay attention to the sound of my voice. You might hear a noise outside. You might notice your mobile phone, but you can only pay attention to a small number of things at once. And it's only the small number of things that you pay attention to that enter into your working memory. Working memory is where conscious, effortful thinking takes place, and we use our working memory all of the time. If I gave you some numbers to add up in your head, you'd have to hold onto one number whilst adding on the other. You'd be using your working memory. But working memory has a very limited capacity. It can only hold onto around four chunks of information at once, and if you bombard working memory with too much information, it can't hold onto it. But assuming you've paid attention to something, and your working memory has been able to process the information, it should lay down a trace in your long-term memory. And this trace is the beginning of a change in long term memory, and learning is a change in your long-term memory.

But long-term memory, doesn't just sit there passively, it's not like files gathering dust in a filing cabinet. It actively supports your working memory when you're trying to learn new information. What you have in your long-term memory helps you to hold onto more information in your working memory. It also helps you to know what to pay attention to. If you know the recipe for spaghetti carbonara, then you'll be able to spot the ingredients in your cupboard more easily when you see them.

One important thing to bear in mind is that we easily forget information. Within minutes or hours, we will lose the detail of the new information that we've learned, so we need lots of opportunities to come back to it, to actively retrieve that information from our long-term memory, so that we can make the information stick.

Now that we've established a basic understanding of how memory works, we can think about how we might teach in a way that helps to overcome its limitations and harness its strengths. To begin with, we can support working memory by drawing on prior knowledge, drawing on information in our long-term memory, like knowledge of words or of number, frees up capacity in our working memory. This is one of the reasons why it's useful to get pupils to commit some foundational knowledge to their long-term memory first.

Another strategy is to think about our exposition. This is the part of the lesson where we introduce new content. When teaching new content, we need to avoid introducing too much material at once and break the material down into manageable chunks. This will reduce the strain on the capacity of our working memory. We also need to remove any unhelpful distractions, like unnecessary classroom noise or redundant words in our instructions. The capacity of our working memory is limited, and anything that gets in the way of pupils' thinking about what we need them to will only make it harder for them. Some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience particular difficulties linked with working memory, and so strategies that reduce the strain on working memory may be especially helpful.

Next we need to give pupils plenty of opportunities to practise when learning new content. Effective practice gets pupils to think hard about their learning. It helps pupils to commit new content to their long-term memories, and therefore, remember it. Finally, retrieving content from our long-term memory helps to make it stick. This doesn't just mean revisiting previously taught content time again. Instead it means providing opportunities for pupils to draw up information from their long-term memory. Asking pupils a question or a quick low stakes quiz can be an effective way of doing this.

Getting the balance right between exposition, practice, and retrieval isn't easy. No formula exists about how long to spend on each. The time spent on exposition, practice, and retrieval will vary depending on your pupils' prior knowledge and what it is that you're teaching. Understanding how pupils learn and adapting your teaching to meet this is an important part of high-quality teaching. Ensuring high quality teaching is an effective approach for all pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities. However, some pupils with special educational needs and disabilities may need additional support on top of the high-quality teaching. Teachers should work closely with the SENCo in their school and other support staff, such as teaching assistants, to ensure that they tailor their instruction to specific needs of some pupils.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In a moment, you're going to watch an Ambition Institute coach, model a sequence
of learning to a Year One class. As you watch, focus on how they do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Breaks complex material into small steps.</li>
  <li>
    Balances exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical
    knowledge and skills.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this model, I'm going to show you a sequence of learning that's aligned with
what we understand about how memory and learning work. For context, imagine that
I'm teaching a year one class how to form the lowercase letter m. They already
know what an m looks like and have practiced forming it in reception, but in
year one, pupils need to refine their handwriting and make it much more
accurate.

<em>
  “The sound we're going to be working on in handwriting today is, mm. Mm.
  Great. Now in a minute, I'm going to show you an example of how we form the
  lowercase letter m. Now in reception, we knew it as, down Maisie mountain
  mountain, but in year one, we need to be a bit more specific. That means, we
  need to be thinking about what m looks like, and how we are forming our m.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Let me show you how I would do it. I want you to pay really close attention to
  where I place my pen. This will help you be really accurate when you have a go
  on your own [Teacher constantly checks pupils are watching as she models]{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I'm going to start Maisie on the top of this middle line, and I'm start by
  going straight down, straight, straight down, and then back up. And I'm going
  to start my mountain at Maisie's shoulder. [Teacher gestures to her shoulder] {" "}
</em>

<em>
  I'm going to go round the mountain and straight down, straight, straight down.
  Oh, I like that.  And then I'm going to go straight back up, and I need to
  make sure my mountains are the same size, here, the same size [Teacher points
  at letter on white board]
</em>

<em>
  And I'm going to go back round again and down. And at the end, I'm going to
  have a little bit of grass. Wow. I'm really happy with that.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Did you see how long it took me? It took me a really long time. Now I want you
  to tell me what to do.{" "}
</em>

<em>Okay. So, what do I do first?</em>

<em>[Pupils answer]</em>

<em>
   Yep, I go straight down, straight, straight, straight down, and then back up.{" "}
</em>

<em>And where do I stop Maisie's mountain? </em>

<em>[Pupils answer]</em>

<em>
  Her shoulder, brilliant. I go around and down and then back up. What size do
  the mountains have to be?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupils answer]</em>

<em>Same size, yep, same size. Can you see that they're the same size? </em>

<em>
  And then I go back down, and what do I have to have at the end? A little bit
  of grass.”
</em>

In the short sequence of learning, I made sure that my teaching was aligned with what we know about memory in several ways. Firstly, I built on pupils' prior knowledge by linking to what they already know about the letter m. In this case, what sound it makes. Because during phonics lessons, pupils learn to associate a sound with a written letter, so hearing this should help them recall what the lowercase letter looks like. Having brought this image to mind, they can focus their attention on how I form the letter.

During my exposition, where I modelled how to form the letter, I took steps to focus pupils' attention on the most important things. I want to ensure that their working memories are processing the most important information. I broke the model down into specific manageable steps that the pupils need to take, like drawing a straight line down, stopping at a point 2/3 of the line, which is equivalent to Maisie's shoulder. Breaking the task down into component parts helps pupil to focus their attention. It provides a mental equivalent of the dotted outlines that they have practised using before.

I was also regularly checking to ensure that all pupils were on task, looking at me as I modelled, because I know that any low-level disruption can really get in the way of their thinking. And it helped that I was writing on a sheet of blank paper. There was nothing to distract them from watching me form the letter.

Finally, I provided lots of opportunities for pupils to practise, to help pupils commit the key learning to their long-term memories. During my model, I asked them to tell me how to form the letter, saying the key steps out loud, straight line down, straight line down, mountains the same size. It helps pupils to develop an inner teacher voice that they can use when working independently. It also meant that I could check to see if pupils knew these key steps before setting them off on their own. Pupils then had plenty of time to practise independently, and during this time, I was able to carefully check their work to make sure that they were not practising mistakes. I know that what they think about is what they will learn.

Even in this short sequence of learning, there are many ways in which I was able to take instruction for memory into account, making it more likely that pupils will be able to access and remember what I teach them.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we've explored what we mean by instruction for memory and looked at

It's quite likely that you're already doing some of these things in your
teaching practice, but everyone can get better. The more you understand about
how pupils learn, the more effective your teaching will be.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Alexander has a clear idea of the content that he wants his pupils to learn. However, despite 'covering' the content in lessons, he still finds that many of his pupils struggle to remember it in future lessons. What can Mr Alexander do to help his pupils remember what they have been taught?

## Key idea

Memory plays an important role pupil learning. Teachers need to understand this and design instruction that is sensitive to the properties and limitations of memory to support remembering.

## Evidence summary

### Pupils remember what they think about

Memory plays an important role in pupil learning. Pupils use the store of knowledge in their long-term memory to make sense of new ideas and to help with higher order tasks like creativity and critical thinking (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, if pupils can’t remember what has been taught previously, we might say that they haven’t learnt it properly and, as a result, they are also unlikely to learn related new material or succeed at tasks that require higher order thinking. Mr Alexander needs to understand the link between memory and learning and adapt his instruction to make remembering more likely.

Mr Alexander’s pupils may be struggling to remember material he has ‘covered’ if too many new ideas have been taught too quickly, exceeding the capacity of pupil working memory (Willingham, 2009). When this happens pupils might experience ‘cognitive overload’.

Attempt the tasks below:

- First try to work out in your head the sum 4 x 7.
- Now try to work out in your head the sum 14 x 273.

Both sums require the same process, but the second sum is more complicated and requires more items to be held in working memory, causing cognitive overload for most people. We learn what we have thought hard about (Coe, 2013). However, when working memory is overloaded like this, pupils are unable to think sufficiently about any of the material and are therefore unlikely to be able to remember it. Some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience particular challenges linked to working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006) and are therefore likely to require additional or adapted support to successfully access material (Willingham, 2009). Conversations with colleagues, families and pupils may support teachers to identify effective strategies.

### Supporting pupil thinking

Mr. Alexander can support pupils to remember taught material by ensuring his instruction supports effective thinking. The capacity of pupil working memory is limited to a few items, the exact number depends on pupil prior knowledge and the items’ complexity (Cowan, 2008). Mr Alexander can support pupil thinking by explicitly linking new material to what has previously been learned and ensuring small steps are used (Rosenshine, 2012). If these steps are the right size, pupils can properly process new information and integrate it into their existing mental models.

Here are two approaches to introducing new material in ways that minimise overloading pupil working memory:

- **Worked examples:** Showing all the steps of a process (for example long multiplication in sum two above) enables pupils to attend to one step at a time.
- **Partially worked examples**: For example, completing the first step of the problem for pupils helps them focus on, and think more deeply about, fewer parts of the problem (Sweller et al., 1998).

However, as pupil knowledge develops, the support which initially helped pupils can get in the way of them using their growing knowledge (Sweller et al., 1998). For example, an explanation of a diagram might help a novice but may distract a pupil who already has the knowledge to interpret the same diagram. So, Mr Alexander gradually needs to remove support as pupil expertise increases.

The I-We-You model can be a useful approach to gradually removing support (Lemov, 2015):

- **‘I do’**: Pupils need direct input to have enough knowledge to avoid their working memory becoming overloaded.
- **‘We do’**: Pupils complete a worked or partially worked example using this knowledge, with teacher support.
- **‘You do’**: Only when he has checked pupils can complete examples successfully with minimal support should Mr Alexander move to independent pupil practice.

### Retrieval for memory over time

Having supported pupils to think successfully about new material, Mr Alexander needs to help pupils remember material over time. We have known for 100 years that without revisiting learning, people forget most material covered within a few days (Ebbinghaus, 1885 in Cowan, 2008).

A powerful way Mr Alexander can support pupils to remember learning is to get them to regularly ‘retrieve’ material covered. Retrieval is the act of recalling information from memory and is beneficial in itself because it helps to 'cement the information to memory’ and makes forgetting less likely (Pashler et al., 2007).

Retrieval is most powerful when pupils have begun to forget material, as this makes pupils think harder when retrieving, strengthening their memories. So, to be most effective, retrieval practice should be spaced out over time (Pashler et al., 2007). For example, Mr Alexander could return to material in a few days and then a few weeks to support his pupils to remember it most successfully.

### Nuances and caveats

One challenge some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience is limited working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006). So, supporting pupil thinking may in itself support these pupils to be successful. However, pupils may have other barriers so teachers should always take care to find out about specific barriers (e.g. visual impairment) and support strategies (e.g. large font copy of class materials).

Individual differences may mean retrieval practice is not equally powerful for all pupils. Factors that affect the impact of retrieval practice on pupil memory include the intervals between teaching and recall, and whether feedback on pupil responses is provided (Agarwal et al., 2017).

  <li>
    Pupils remember content they think hard about, and they can’t think if their

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
Each of our pupils is individual. Each of them enters the classroom with their own
pre-existing knowledge base, drawn from lots of different sources: their experiences,
their prior learning, their interests and their values. And this prior knowledge
plays an important role in pupil learning. It helps pupil to make sense of what they
learn, and to remember in the long term. Teachers need to understand why prior knowledge
matters, identify what prior knowledge their pupils have, and know how to use it
in their teaching.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Prior knowledge matters a lot. Firstly, prior knowledge helps pupils to make sense
of what they're learning about. If a pupil reads a text about football and they already
know a lot about the topic, they will find it easier to access and understand. Secondly,
if we want pupil to remember what they learn and be able to use it in the future,
it needs to be connected to existing knowledge.

In order to take advantage of prior knowledge, teachers first need to identify what relevant prior knowledge pupils do and do not have, and then decide what to do about it. This may include identifying gaps in prior knowledge. Another way of thinking about prior knowledge, is as a mental model. When we ask what prior knowledge pupils have, we're asking, what might their existing mental model of the content look like? What knowledge might it contain? How well connected is that knowledge? And what gaps or misconceptions might that be?

Once teachers have a better understanding of what their pupils do and do not know, they can use it to inform and adapt their teaching. They can help pupils to recall prior knowledge and point out to pupils how what they're learning is connected to what they know. Where prior knowledge of content is weak, teachers can use other strategies to help their pupils to access what they're learning. Like reducing the amounts of new content introduced at one time, breaking down the learning into small steps and using concrete examples. And if teachers identify misconceptions in pupils' knowledge, they can plan to address these errors. For example, many pupils hold a misconception, that things that are heavy sink. Knowing that this is a misconception in advance, a teacher might choose to bring in a heavy object, that will float.

One thing to bear in mind is that transferring what we know from one discipline to a new unfamiliar context, can be difficult. Just because pupils know how to analyse a historical source, doesn't mean they'll be able to apply the same skills when analysing a poem. The most useful prior knowledge to build on will be that which is closest to the subject specific content that you are teaching.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the following example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model how they
might build on pupil prior knowledge, during a starter activity. As you watch, pay
particular attention to how they do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Plans to connect new content with pupils’ existing knowledge</li>
  <li>Links what pupils already know to what is being taught</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example I'm going to model, how we can use the starter activity, to
connect new knowledge with pupils' existing knowledge. I want you to imagine I'm
teaching a year eight History lesson, about how religion changed, during the
reign of Edward VI, the youngest son of Henry VIII. They've just completed a
starter activity, where they retrieved relevant prior knowledge about the life
of Henry VIII, such as identifying his children, their age and their religion.
They've been asked to hypothesise what impact the children's religion may have
on Tudor England in the future. There are clear and establish routines in the
classroom for completing stater activities. And pupils complete this work in
silence. I'm going to begin my model, having just gathered responses to stater
activity.

<em>
  “So we've just recalled the names of Henry VII children, and some of the
  details about them, including their religion. Today, we're going to be
  discussing what happened to religion in Tudor England after Henry VIII died.
  Some of you have already hypothesized, what do you think will happen to
  religion, based on the different religions of Henry VIII children. But first,
  we need to figure out, who's going to take control.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Who do you think is going to succeed to the throne, after Henry VII dies? So
  will it be? Number one, Edward, Henry's youngest child, or will it be number
  two? Mary, his eldest daughter. Show me on your hands in three, two, one.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Teacher pauses and scans the class]</em>

<em>
  Okay. So lots of you have said, number two, Mary, the correct answer is
  Edward. So let's work out why.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Thinking back, why did Henry VIII divorce Catherine of Aragon, his first wife.
  Tom,?
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>
  Exactly. Henry VIII didn't think that a girl was going be strong enough to
  rule England. And at that time, male heirs took priority even if they had an
  older sister. So, Edward becomes King after Henry VIII died.”
</em>

In this model, I connected new content to pupils' existing knowledge. In the first instance, I planned a starter activity where pupils have to retrieve relevant prior knowledge about who Henry VIII children were and their religion. As we review the responses to that activity, I could identify and address any gaps in this knowledge. I then made it clear to pupils that they would be able to use what they know about Edward VI, to understand, how and why religion changed during his reign. I'm helping them to see how their learning fits together.

Secondly, I identified a potential misconception in their prior knowledge. In this example, pupils know that Edward VI was the younger son. But typically, they tend to think that it is the eldest child who succeeds to the throne. I asked a direct question to check for this misconception and then gave the correct answer with a clear explanation about why it was right. Thinking about what pupils already know helps me to identify what knowledge will help them in understanding new learning. As well as anything that might get in the way of it.

## Teaching challenge

Ms McShane finds it hard to ensure all pupils understand the new ideas she teaches. She has noticed that many have gaps in prior knowledge, even if they have covered related topics in previous years, or the topic is one she taught them herself. Others struggle to link new ideas to their existing knowledge. How can she check and build upon pupil prior knowledge to help them understand new ideas?

## Key idea:

Pupil learning is more successful if teachers check, activate and build on pupil prior knowledge.

## Evidence summary

### Prior knowledge helps us make sense of new material

“The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner knows already” (Ausubel, 1968 in Simonsmeier et al., 2018). This is because pupils “come to understand new ideas by relating them to old ideas” (Willingham, 2009). Existing knowledge (stored in long-term memory) is what makes new ideas meaningful.

We can illustrate this by looking at sentences we might ask pupils to understand. As you read the sentences below, consider what pupils need to know to make sense of each one:

1. To convert a decimal to a fraction, use place value.
2. Two households, both alike in dignity,
   In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
3. Some say that Henry only made the break with Rome because the Pope would not let him have a divorce (Byrom et al., 1997).

For example, if pupils don’t know who Henry was, who the Pope was and why a divorce mattered to him, the sentence – and the topic – will make little sense.

Teachers can help pupils to learn by linking new ideas to prior knowledge. This makes it easier to process those new ideas. For example, if pupils have studied stories about adventures previously, they know what to expect in encountering a new adventure story. This then makes it easier to remember them, by connecting the new ideas to existing knowledge. The greater pupils’ prior knowledge, the easier learning becomes for them: “it is easier to learn new information… \[and] to solve new problems when one has a rich, well-connected body of knowledge and strong ties and connections” (Rosenshine, 2012). Well-organised prior knowledge makes it even easier for pupils to learn new ideas.

### Weak prior knowledge can cause pupils to misunderstand

For prior knowledge to help pupils, it needs to be complete and accurate: if pupil prior knowledge is weak, pupils can misunderstand new material. If pupils hold misconceptions or lack correct knowledge, they can form misconceptions. For example, knowing that the surface of the Earth appears flat may lead pupils to conclude that the Earth is a disc (Simonsmeier et al., 2018). If Ms McShane tries to introduce a new idea which does not fit into a pupil’s current mental model – particularly if the pupil’s mental model is inaccurate – that pupil may misunderstand or reject this idea (Chi, 2009).

### Activating prior knowledge can help pupils to succeed

An effective starting point for teachers is to identify what pupils already know, and any gaps in their knowledge. Having done so, Ms McShane can seek to introduce new material in small enough chunks to be comprehensible, and to make explicit links between prior knowledge and the new ideas. Where pupils have missing or incomplete knowledge, adding new concepts will help pupils to develop more sophisticated mental models. However, where Ms McShane’s pupils already hold beliefs which happen to be wrong, she must focus on changing old concepts (Chi, 2009). When introducing new material, Ms McShane needs to develop pupils’ mental models by taking small steps and posing lots of questions which explicitly link pupil prior knowledge with the concepts being taught.

### Nuances and caveats

If pupils have lots of prior knowledge and are reminded of this, it can prevent them from looking for new or better problem solutions (Simonsmeier et al., 2018) – like a driver going into autopilot: they stop thinking hard and therefore don’t develop their mental model.

$I

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Ms McShane can begin to improve her instruction by understanding that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Drawing on existing mental models helps us to learn new information and
    solve new problems more effectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Weak prior knowledge can lead to misconceptions. Ms McShane must make the
    effort to diagnose what her pupils do know, don’t know and misunderstand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ms McShane can build on this by reviewing pupil prior knowledge and
    introducing new material in steps while asking lots of questions.
  </li>
  <li>
    By carefully activating pupil prior knowledge and challenging pupils’
    incorrect beliefs, she can support pupils to develop accurate mental models.

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>A lot of what we teach our pupils will be new
or abstract, and it can be difficult to learn. To help with this, teachers can explicitly
teach the knowledge and skills that pupils need to succeed. Exposition is the part
of a lesson where the teacher can explicitly teach their pupils. This includes explaining,
modelling and demonstrating. Exposition provides an opportunity for teachers to set
things out clearly.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Exposition is the part of the lesson where the teacher carefully shares material
with pupils. Think of it as the I part, where I refers to the teacher sharing something
with their pupils. Our working memories where conscious thinking takes place, have
a limited capacity and can become overloaded, especially when dealing with unfamiliar
content. Good expositions support pupils to think by breaking knowledge down to steps,
highlighting key ideas, and building on what pupils already know.

Depending on the content, teachers may want to choose between the following modes of delivery: explaining, modelling, or demonstrating. Different modes will suit different content.

An explanation is where we clearly tell students some information. This works well for explaining a concept. One approach is to give a carefully worded definition, and then a couple of examples. In a primary maths lesson, this might mean showing pupils an empty bottle of water and explaining that capacity is the amount that something can hold. In history, this might mean explaining what propaganda is followed by an example of a propaganda poster using the first world war, to encourage women into the workplace. Another approach is to use a concrete example, such as number blocks for visualizing tens and units. Teachers can use the concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts like addition.

Modelling is where we work through a process, articulating the steps and our thinking process as we go. In an English lesson, a teacher might tell pupils that a topic sentence introduces the main idea of a paragraph, and share their thought process out loud, like <em>"I'm looking for the first sentence in the paragraph"</em>, as they scan a paragraph on the white boards. Sometimes a visual representation of the concept or process that you're modelling helps pupils to understand the material.

Demonstrating is where a teacher uses the physical object to show a process or a concept, such as how to use shade with charcoal pencils, or how to use a ray box, slit and lens to see how different surfaces refract light. As the teacher demonstrates, they draw our attention to the important features and the most relevant thought processes.

To be effective, expositions need to be carefully planned. At the planning stage, teachers can identify what they want pupils to know or be able to do. They need to do this in detail. One approach that can be helpful is to complete the following sentences:<em> “I want my pupils to know that...” </em>or <em>“I want my pupils to be able to...”  </em>Being granular and specific at this stage will improve the clarity of expositions.

Teachers also need to ask themselves where their pupils' current starting point is. Expositions should build on what pupils already know. This will help them to access the content and link it to existing knowledge.

Finally, teachers need to plan out what they say in advance. Scripting expositions is a good idea.

To get the best out of an exposition in the lesson itself, pupils need to think hard during it. To promote this, teachers can ask questions during the exposition. Questions can draw attention to the key features of the example, model or demonstration, and they can also check for pupil understanding.

Overall, pupils shouldn't be passive during an exposition.  Instead, they need to think about the new content they are learning. Only then will they be able to use it independently, an important goal of good expositions and effective teaching.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In a moment, you'll see an Ambition Institute coach give an example of how to model
during an exposition. Pay particular attention to the following as you watch:
<ul>
  <li>Start expositions at the point of current pupil understanding</li>
  <li>
    How modelling provides more structure for learners early on in the domain
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I'm going to model how teacher exposition can support pupils to
learn.  I want you to imagine I'm teaching a year four geography lesson, and
this is part of a series on ordinance survey maps. In this lesson, pupils will
learn how to use four figure grid references to locate places on a map.

<em>
  “Okay, class, last lesson, we looked at ordinance survey maps, and how people
  can use them. But this lesson, we're going to be looking at how we find
  certain things on the map.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Okay, before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to three things
  on the map.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  The first is that the map is divided into squares [teacher points to squares
  on map].
</em>

<em>
  The next thing is that we've got a horizontal line along the bottom. This is
  called the eastings, and it's numbered, 74, 75, 76, et cetera [teacher points
  to eastings line].
</em>

<em>
  And the final thing is that we've got a vertical line up the side. This is
  called the northings, and this is also numbered, one, two, three, and so on
  [teacher points to northings line].{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So when we want to help somebody find something on a map, we give them a grid
  reference.  This is a four digit number and it's made up of the eastings and
  northings line numbers. So rather than somebody having to look on the map all
  over to find the thing that you've told them to look for, instead, we give
  them the four digit grid reference. And this is what I'm going to teach you
  today, how to create that four digit number.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do is decide on a symbol that I'm going
  to be looking for. I'm going to use the symbol P, what does the symbol P mean?
  Aisha?
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>
  Parking, super. Okay, so the first thing I do is I highlight the square that
  has my symbol in, and then I'm going put a cross in the bottom left hand
  corner, you will see why in a moment.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So, remember those lines we were talking about, the eastings is the first one
  we start with, along the bottom, the horizontal.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher drawing on map on board] So we go along the bottom until we come in
  line with that x that we just drew. And now look at the number, 77. So this
  forms the first part of my grid reference, and I put a comma after it. The
  next thing I do is I then look at the northings. So I'm going to now go up
  until I hit that cross again. And I look at the number here, 05. So this goes
  here after the comma, one, two, three, four, that's my four digit grid
  reference number.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So there's a couple of things I like to remember that helps me get these
  numbers in the correct order. We have to put eastings first and northings
  second, so I remember along the corridor and then up the stairs.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Let's do a couple more together, using that to help you remember the order
  they go in.”
</em>

I want to draw your attention to a couple of things in that model. First, let's think about how I use pupils' current understanding as a starting point for the exposition. So, from the previous lesson, pupils know that a map is designed to help people navigate to somewhere. Knowing that maps are designed for navigation gives a meaningful and concrete purpose for the grid reference task. I also used the terms vertical and horizontal when introducing pupils to the new terms. I know that we'd learn the terms vertical and horizontal in maths and art.

Secondly, I explained and modelled the process of given a full figure grid reference to scaffold and support the learning. I use non-verbal gestures like tracing around the square with my finger to reinforce what I wanted the pupils to focus on, and I articulated my thought processes out loud, like always start from the bottom left hand corner. In doing this, I provided pupils with clear steps to follow, which is a really useful structure for their thinking. As I provide further examples that model and demonstrate this process, this is going to help pupils become familiar with identifying symbols and locating places of interest using the grid references. We'll work on these examples on the board, practising a range of examples together before moving on to the independent practice.

By modelling the process that we want pupils to engage in clearly, we can help to support and scaffold the new learning.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored how exposition can be used to support pupils to access
content. Expositions are especially important for setting up new or complex material.
Before we finish, read through the key ideas of the module. Which of these have you
applied in a recent lesson?
<ul>
  <li>
    Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need
    more structure early in a domain
  </li>
  <li>Starting expositions at the point of current pupil understanding</li>
  <li>
    Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation of
    the same concept or process, where appropriate
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Teachers are likely to use expositions in the majority of lessons they teach.
They might explain, model or demonstrate. It's a key instructional tool, which
at its best can make content much more accessible and increase the chance of
success.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Thomas is confident about what her pupils should learn. However, when she tries to convey new content to pupils, she struggles to keep their attention: if she gives a quick explanation, she gets lots of questions and confusion, but if she goes into a lot of detail, she fears pupils will stop listening. How can Ms Thomas most efficiently support her pupils’ thinking when conveying new ideas in her lessons, and get a sense of whether pupils have understood?

## Key idea

Effective exposition uses models, concrete examples and is matched to pupils’ needs.

## Evidence summary

### Effective exposition

Effective teaching takes account of the limits of pupils’ working memories. Pupils may struggle if they experience cognitive overload: this is particularly likely if pupils are exposed to too much new material at once. Ms Thomas can manage pupil thinking effectively by introducing material in stages by:

- Drawing on prior knowledge, explicitly linking to what pupils have already been taught.
- Breaking material up into smaller chunks when introducing it to reduce overload.
- Structuring her teaching around an ‘I-We-You' model. This should begin with what pupils already know; provide them with a clear explanation of the key ideas and demonstration of the task (I do); provide an opportunity to practise the task collectively and for the teacher to check pupil understanding (We do); and finally move to pupils working independently (You do) (Lemov, 2015).

The I-We-You structure provides multiple opportunities for teachers to convey new ideas by using concrete examples, modelling, and worked examples (Lemov, 2015). These place manageable demands on pupils’ working memory, supporting them to actively process and understand new material (Deans for Impact, 2015).

### Explanations

When should Ms Thomas give explanations? Explanations are more effective when teachers want to convey concepts rather than processes (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). However, the examples teachers give are more important in pupils’ understanding than the explanations accompanying them (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). Ms Thomas wants her pupils to understand both concrete ideas (things they can visualise, like ‘numbers as counters’) and abstract ideas (things with fewer sensory properties such as ‘multiplication of numbers’).

She can best convey this to her pupils by using concrete examples in her exposition (ideally linked to current pupil understanding) and connecting them with more abstract ones, or by moving from concrete to abstract representations over time (Pashler et al., 2007). For example, she may introduce multiplication using counters and then remove these as pupils gain understanding of multiplication as an operation. Pupils find it easier to process an explanation where images are paired with spoken words, rather than where images are accompanied with extensive written text (Pashler et al., 2007).

### Modelling

Concrete examples can help Ms Thomas to introduce new concepts. What about new processes? When learning how to solve problems, pupils need support with their thinking through modelling. When teachers model and think aloud while demonstrating how to solve a problem, this provides cognitive support (Rosenshine, 2012). Modelling can be done in a variety of ways; the goal is to give pupils a scaffold while they are a novice before gradually removing it as their mental model develops.

For Ms Thomas, modelling might involve talking her pupils through each step of a new problem in maths. For writing an essay it might involve talking through the decisions she would make in writing. A particularly powerful form of modelling for new processes is providing a worked example that the teacher walks the class through. Novices who are provided with worked examples when learning a new problem outperform those without them (Sweller, 2016).

Worked examples reduce cognitive load by providing scaffolding to help pupils break a problem into chunks, allowing teachers to introduce the problem step-by-step (Deans for Impact, 2015). Furthermore, providing worked examples can help pupils to focus on the relevant parts of the problem rather than wasting time looking at irrelevant solutions, or mismatching problems and solutions (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). Worked examples provide scaffolding to help pupils master a particular part of the problem, both securing it within their mental model, and making it available to draw on it when required for the next part of the problem.

In sum, including concrete and abstract examples, and modelling by thinking aloud through worked examples, can effectively support pupils to understand new ideas without overloading their working memory.

### Checking pupil understanding

In the opening problem, Ms Thomas also wanted to ensure that her pupils understood content. While examples and modelling can convey material, she will only know whether pupils have understood by checking their understanding. Pupils tend to believe that they understand something if it feels familiar, even if their understanding is superficial (Christodoulou, 2016). Formative assessments can help Ms Thomas gather information about what each of her pupils do and do not understand. After modelling how to complete a problem and before getting pupils to practise independently, Ms Thomas could ask questions to check pupil understanding.

### Nuances and caveats

While guided instruction through modelling is more effective for novices than other forms of instruction, removing cognitive supports as pupils gain expertise is vital. Where pupils already have a strong understanding of how to solve a problem, worked examples may distract them from a process which they are capable of completing independently (Pashler et al., 2007).

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
Learning involves lots of interaction between teachers and pupils. We can't simply
tell our pupil something and assume that they'll learn it. Instead teachers need
to regularly say to themselves: I've taught them something, but have they understood
it? If pupils haven't understood something, how can I fix it? They need to ask lots
of questions to explore what their pupils know and adapt their teaching based on
what they find out.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Adaptive teaching is where teachers identify what pupils know and can do and adapt
their teaching in response. Adapting teaching helps to ensure that instruction and
support are tailored to the particular needs of pupils. Pupils are likely to learn
at different rates and require different levels of support.

Some pupils will have special educational needs and disabilities which may require additional support, although having SEND is neither fixed nor permanent in all instances and can vary from subject to subject. We need to think carefully about what our pupils' differences are before we can adapt and tailor our teaching to meet their different needs. By giving the right level of stretch and support, teachers can help all pupils to meet challenging learning goals.

In order to adapt teaching effectively, teachers need to take steps both before and during a lesson. Before a lesson teachers can ask themselves three key questions:

<ul>
  <li>What do I know about my pupils?</li>
  <li>What do I know about the content I am teaching?</li>
  <li>How might I adapt my teaching?</li>
</ul>
When answering the question, “what do I know about my pupils?” teachers should consider
whether they have any pupils with special educational needs or disabilities in their
class. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require
additional supports. Teachers should work with colleagues, families and pupils to
identify potential barriers to learning in advance. Another way of responding to
the question, “what do I know about my pupils?” is to look at reliable assessment
data. A task carried out at the end of the previous lesson might give teachers a
useful indication of what relevant prior knowledge their pupils have. Teachers shouldn't
answer this question through guesswork or assumptions. Adaptive teaching shouldn't
lead to teachers setting lower expectations for some pupils.

To answer the question, “what do I know about the content I am teaching?” teachers can identify the key knowledge and skills that they want their pupils to get right, where their pupils might go wrong and how they will check pupil understanding during the lesson. It's a good idea to ask a colleague who's taught the content before about common misconceptions. As teachers get to know their subject and pupils, they will be able to make better predictions about specific content that some pupils may need support with.

Finally, teachers need to spend some time in advance thinking about how they might respond. This could involve thinking of additional examples to give to pupils if they struggle to grasp a particular idea or providing them with another practice task. It might mean planning what questions you will ask to stretch or support pupil thinking. In some instances, teachers may need to provide additional or adapted support for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. It's important to work with specialist colleagues in school such as the SENDCo when doing this.

Another response might be to flexibly group pupils within a class to provide more tailored support. In the early stages of learning phonics, for example, some pupils may be able to start learning more complex sounds whereas other pupils may still be learning the sounds of individual letters. When delivering phonics instruction to the class, it may be useful to split the class into groups and tailor support to where each group is in their learning, recognizing that pupils develop fluency in phonics at very different rates and that pupils should not feel that they are either good or bad readers as a result of this grouping. Flexibly grouping pupils needs to be done very carefully and teachers need to consider the impact that it has on motivation and engagement.

So far, we have thought about what teachers can do before a lesson to adapt their teaching. We also need to consider what they can do during a lesson. During the lesson adaptive teaching involves teaching, checking and responding. Adaptive teaching should occur after some teacher input. Typically this happens during the exposition. This is sometimes referred to as the I do part of the lesson. The teacher can then check for understanding and respond based on what they find out. This part of the lesson is sometimes referred to as the we do part of the lesson. One way to check for understanding is through a series of questions. They could use a well-crafted multiple choice question that brings to light key misconceptions. Once teachers have this information, they can decide how to respond. You might need to re-explain something or correct a misconception. Pupils might need another example or you might want to provide a worked example where you go through a task or problem with pupils step-by-step. If teachers find that pupils are doing well in their learning, they might want to remove scaffolding in place, ask a question to stretch their thinking or set them off on some independent work.

Responding to pupil needs shouldn't mean creating 30 different worksheets for 30 different pupils. Re-explaining something, providing another example or asking another question are quick and effective strategies that teachers shouldn't overlook. Working out the best way to respond on the spot isn't easy and it's something that teachers get better at over time as they get to know their pupils and their subject. But the more you've thought about how you will respond in advance, the better you'll be able to do so in the moment.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In this example you will see an Ambition coach model how to check that pupils understand
a key concept within a lesson before moving on. As you watch, pay particular attention
to how they do the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Structures tasks and instructions to enable the identification of knowledge
    gaps and misconceptions
  </li>
  <li>
    Adapts the lesson to address gaps in knowledge and misconception whilst
    maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the
    opportunity to meet expectations
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>I want you to imagine that I'm
teaching a year seven maths lesson on fractions.  Pupils have been asked to add
the fractions from the board and to select the correct solution from the choices
available. So this is the problem.

Calculate 3/8 plus 1/4 and select the correct answer from the options below.

A: 3/32

B: 5/8

C: 4/12

D: 5/16

Each of the incorrect solutions has been generated to uncover some common misconceptions in knowledge that pupils have around adding fractions. I want to identify whether pupils hold these misconceptions and then respond by adapting the lesson if they exist. Pupils are using mini white boards to display their solutions so when I ask pupils to show me that answers, while some pupils have the correct answer, there are some who have made each of the errors. Therefore I'm going to go through the options pointing out where they might have gone wrong.

<em>
  “Okay, guys, we're going to do a show me in five, four, lids on pens, please.
  Three, pens down, two, one. Show me [teacher scans the class].
</em>

<em>
  Okay, hold them up nice and high please. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, keep them up. Okay
  super.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Alright, put those down. I can see a variety of responses around the room so
  what I'd like to do is I'd like to go back through the process so we can
  identify maybe where we went wrong and prevent you going wrong there in the
  future.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Okay so let's have a look at the board. So this is our original problem. Now
  those of you who've got C, just have a look at your board now, if you've
  arrived at C, you've been thinking we're adding fractions. So what you've done
  is you've added three plus one, you've added your numerators and you've also
  then added your denominators so you've ended up at 4/12. But in actual fact
  the first thing we need to think about is making the denominators the same. We
  want equivalent fractions. So we need a number that both eight and four go
  into, a multiple. Can you give me a multiple of eight and four? Lucy?
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
   You got 32. Yeah. Okay so you got 32 so you've multiplied eight by four and
  you've ended up with 32 and you've got eight there on your board, haven't you
  and I can see a few more around the room. How'd you then think you got three
  as your numerator if you've put A? What else do you think you did? Josh?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
  Yeah, you've multiplied three by one because you've multiplied the bottom as
  well. So you've gone through the first process of wanting to get the same
  denominator, but in actual fact we needed to find the lowest common multiple.
  So what's the smallest number eight and four go into? Jessica?
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
   Yep, eight, absolutely. So the first thing that we do is if we've multiplied
  four by two to make it eight, we also do the same thing to the top so we're
  going to multiply that by two. So we end up with 2/8. And what I'm going to do
  is I'm going to write down the rest of the problem next to it because
  obviously there's a bit of a jumble of information up here. So now our
  question becomes 3/8 plus 2/8. At this point you might think all your work's
  done. If you have ended up with your answer is D, Jamie, what do you think you
  might have done there?
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
   So you're thinking you've got 5/16. You've added eight and eight. Yeah,
  absolutely and you've added three and two, but in actual fact we want this to
  be all part of the same whole. These are all part of the same whole. So we
  never add the denominators. We add the numerators only. So three plus two is
  five, denominator stays the same so our correct answer is B. So now you've got
  that.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Wipe your boards clean and we're going try another one together to see if we
  can overcome those mistakes next time around.”
</em>

I want to draw your attention to a couple of things in the model. First, I structured the problem so that I could identify misconceptions. I began by identifying the problems that I anticipated pupils would have. The incorrect responses illustrated typical mistakes pupils make. Multiplying values instead of adding, not finding a common denominator and then also adding the denominators together. I know from discussions with experienced colleagues that these are the errors that pupils commonly make so it's really important to check for them.

Secondly, I checked for understanding across the whole class. By using multiple choice questions here, I was able to see all of my pupils answers really quickly and get a picture of what they did or didn't understand. If I'd have just asked one or two pupils to provide their answer, it probably wouldn't have told me enough about the whole class to adapt my teaching effectively.

Finally, I asked individual pupils questions that would require them to think through how they got to the answer that they did, supporting them to realize their error. The key to this model is the fact that I had anticipated where the pupils may go wrong and I have planned what my response would be. If I know what I'm looking for, I can spot it more quickly and then I can focus my efforts on giving a really high-quality response instead of working one out on the spot.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video we have looked at some of the ways in which teachers can identify what
pupils know and how they might respond. Which of the following ideas do you think
that the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Structure tasks and instructions to enable the identification of knowledge
    gaps and misconceptions
  </li>
  <li>Include a range of types of questions to extend and challenge pupils</li>
  <li>
    Adapt the lesson to address gaps in knowledge and misconception whilst
    maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the
    opportunity to meet expectations
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Learning something new isn't a linear process. It won't look the same for all
pupils. Learning requires a regular back and forth between the teacher and the
pupil to check how it's going. Teachers need to identify what pupils are
thinking and adapt their teaching in response. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Ms Garcia feels increasingly confident at identifying key content and presenting it effectively, building on pupil prior knowledge. However, she notices that sometimes pupils grasp key ideas quickly, while at other times pupils struggle to do so at all. Sometimes it is individuals or groups of pupils that struggle, at other times the whole class. How can she adapt her teaching to better meet the needs of all pupils?

## Key idea

Adapting teaching requires assessment of pupil needs and appropriate teacher responses, before the lesson and within it, to enable a high pupil success rate.

## Evidence summary

### Adapting teaching aims to support all pupils to be successful

Effective teachers adapt their teaching to respond to the needs of the class and individual pupils (OECD, 2015). This doesn’t mean adapting lessons to different ‘learning styles’ such as ‘visual’ or ‘kinaesthetic’ as the evidence is unambiguous: while pupils have different learning preferences, they do not have distinct learning styles (Coe, 2013).

When pupils are introduced to new ideas, explicit guided teaching is more effective than pupils discovering new ideas without teacher support (Coe et al., 2014). However, pupils learn at different rates and have different levels of prior knowledge. Effective approaches to establishing pupils needs and adapting teaching are available. Teachers can check pupils’ needs through gathering information on what pupils do and don’t understand yet. Once they have, adaptations they could make include:

- New information broken down into smaller steps.
- Additional explanations and examples.
- Additional forms of teacher support (Gathercole et al., 2006)
- Additional stretch, for example through questions which extend pupil thinking, or removal of unnecessary support.

This is responsive teaching: using evidence of what pupils have understood to allow us to adapt our teaching to better meet pupils’ needs (Wiliam, in Christodoulou, 2017).

Responsive teaching does not mean creating distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or setting lower expectations for some (Pashler et al. 2007). Instead it entails identifying key content pupils might struggle with and options to support or stretch them, to make sure all pupils are successful. To make the workload of adapting teaching manageable, teachers should focus on a few key barriers and key adaptations.

### Find out what pupils know, and teach them accordingly

Responsive teaching requires effective ways to monitor pupils’ learning (Deunk et al., 2018). If what pupils learnt was the same as what they were taught, there would be no need for assessment at all; however, we know that what pupils remember from a lesson can vary enormously (Wiliam, 2010).

Ms Garcia needs to collect and use assessment information to inform her key instructional decisions (Wiliam & Leahy, 2015). She can either use information to decide whether to adapt teaching between lessons, or within a lesson. To adapt effectively, she needs to prepare assessments based on key information she needs pupils to understand, to show her which pupils lack key knowledge or hold misconceptions and which pupils have a firm grasp of key material (Christodoulou, 2017). For example, teachers can use a sequence of carefully crafted questions and collect whole class responses to detect misconceptions and so more precisely target their teaching (Christodoulou, 2017).

### Adapting teaching before the lesson

Some adaptations can be planned before the lesson or unit begins. It is good practice for teachers to seek support and information in advance about specific barriers to learning and specific solutions to these for individual pupils, particularly for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. A conversation with the SENCO or parents or referring to the SEND code of practice may help. For example, a teacher may find out that a pupil’s ability to write is impaired and print resources for them. Teachers can also draw on formative assessment data collected in a previous lesson to adapt teaching to either stretch or support pupils.

### Adapting teaching within the lesson: worked examples and groups

Pre-lesson preparation can also support responsive teaching within the lesson, guided by the I-We-You instructional approach to get the right balance of stretch and support (Lemov, 2015). Teachers can prepare adaptations in advance and deploy them responsively if assessment reveals pupils need them.

If in lesson assessment reveals the majority of pupils have struggled with a specific idea or question, teachers can use worked examples to illustrate correct solutions. Worked examples reduce the cognitive burden that pupils feel when learning a new skill by breaking it down into smaller sections, allowing pupils to master the foundations before moving onto more complex parts (Deans for Impact, 2015). Ms Garcia may choose to use an additional worked example with pupils who have not yet grasped a particular skill; or break down a worked example even further for certain pupils while ensuring all work towards the same endpoint. Pupils benefit from explicit teaching and hearing many examples and questions (Rosenshine, 2012) so, if in doubt, giving a further example will often be helpful, even if assessment suggests some pupils have understood the idea.

Ms Garcia may also want to consider how to adapt groupings within her classroom to ensure that she can best tailor support to individuals’ needs. Grouping pupils within a class based on their current level of understanding could help Ms Garcia more precisely target support. Doing so relies on assessing pupils’ needs accurately, providing all groups with sufficient support and maintaining high expectations for everyone (Coe et al., 2014). For example, assessment may reveal most pupils are ready for independent practice, but a few still need teacher support, in which case Ms Garcia may create a small focus group to support once the class is practising independently – though she must be careful to make clear that this group is based on attainment and change it regularly. However, this may be tricky to achieve without embedded routines and behaviour expectations (IES, 2008).

### Nuances and caveats

Grouping pupils by ability has a limited impact on pupil outcomes (Coe et al., 2014) so care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.

The aim of responsive teaching is to support pupil success. If pupils are practising independently and struggling, Ms Garcia should still stop the class (or intervene with particular pupils) to provide further support. Similarly, if Ms Garcia’s assessment suggests pupils need stretching, she can let pupils move on to more challenging work, while monitoring carefully to ensure they are successful, in case support is needed.

Teaching assistants can adapt teaching for assigned pupils, for example pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. However, they need to be prepared for the lesson by the teacher, and supplement not replace teacher support (EEF, 2018). For example, providing they can further break down tasks during guided practice.

Ms Garcia can effectively adapt her teaching if she understands that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Adapting teaching means identifying key adaptations and deploying them
    responsively to ensure pupils experience a high success rate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whole class questioning can expose what pupils understand to inform
    responsive teaching.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teachers need to understand key pupil differences and potential barriers to
    learning, especially for pupils with special educational needs or
    disabilities, and prepare solutions <em>before</em> the lesson.
  </li>
  <li>
    Worked examples and careful grouping can support pupils to fill knowledge

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
In order to learn something, pupils need lots of opportunities to practise it. They
need time to think carefully about the content, to commit it to their long-term memory.
Pupils need lots of time practising with a teacher and lots of time practising on
their own. They also need the chance to retrieve what they know, which is called
retrieval practice. Practice is an important part of learning and teachers need to
know how to get the best out of it.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
When we discuss practice, we're talking about the opportunities for people to think
hard about content or retrieve previously learned content. Think of it as the you
do phase of the I, we, you model, where pupils are primarily working without teacher
input. Providing our pupils with opportunities to think about challenging content
increasingly on their own will help them secure what they learn and use it later
on.

In order to remember something in the long term, pupils need to think about it and connect it to existing knowledge. Because we have a tendency to forget over time, pupils also need repeated opportunities to draw up information from their long-term memory. This is called retrieval practice. Effective practice gets pupils to think hard about what it is you want them to remember.

When designing practice, teachers need to check that the tasks get pupils to think about what they want them to learn and that the thinking required is pitched at the right level. Firstly, we need to ensure that practice tasks get pupils to think about the concepts, knowledge, and skills that we want pupils to remember. For example, when teaching photosynthesis, you might create a practice task that involves drawing a picture of a plant. Whilst this is clearly linked to the learning, there is a risk that pupils will spend lots of time thinking about colouring in the plant. We want them to think hard about the process, so it might be better to present them with an image of a plant and ask them to annotate it. Pupils will remember what they think about during a task. On the other hand, if a pupil doesn't think about the learning, they won't remember it.

Secondly, we need to pitch practice carefully. We want our pupils to think hard when facing challenging work but also to put their best effort in and experience a high success rate. If practice is too hard, then it's likely to be off-putting. So teachers need to check that pupils have acquired enough knowledge during previous stages of learning to be able to work more independently. Equally, teachers need to ensure that the task will stretch pupils. If practice is too easy, it won't require much cognitive effort. Pupil thinking needs to be effortful if it is to be retained. Getting the pitch of practice right gets easier as teachers get to know their pupils and develop their subject knowledge over time. Teachers should also ensure that they provide pupils with enough support in the previous phases of instruction before asking pupils to work independently. This can help them to achieve that high rate of success.

As well as making sure that pupils have acquired enough knowledge to access the activity, it can also help to use the same material in guided practice and independent practice. For example, if teachers have guided pupils through the process of accurately using commas to punctuate a subordinate clause, it makes sense to ask them to practice this same task on their own, rather than practicing adding commas to separate items in a list. Or if a history teacher has modelled the analytical process of identifying the nature, origin, and purpose of a picture source, it would be helpful for pupils to have a go at following this analytical process on their own, perhaps on a different picture source, assuming that pupils have the necessary knowledge to access both.

One thing to bear in mind is that there is no set formula for how much practice pupils will need. The amount, frequency, and emphasis of practice varies depending on the content and on the pupil. For example, a teacher might choose to come back to the difference between a fact and opinion a number of times across the year. This is a core concept that pupils need to remember. However, once a pupil has grasped the term onomatopoeia quickly, a teacher might not dedicate precious practice time to it.

Teachers also need to expect the unexpected when pupils are practicing on their own. Even when a teacher has checked that pupils understand something before they practice, they still might make mistakes. Teachers need to check pupil work during practice and may need to correct errors or pause and reteach. Pupils may well make mistakes during practice, but they shouldn't continue to practise these same mistakes over time. Otherwise, there is a risk that mistakes will stick.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see an Ambition coach model how they might set up an
independent practice task. As you watch, pay particular attention to how the coach
does the following:
<ul>
  <li>Plans activities around what pupils should think hard about</li>
  <li>
    Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough
    support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting
    challenging work
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I'm going to model how the teacher sets up independent
practice, which links to the learning in class and the pupils' previous
learning. I want you to imagine that this is a year eight French lesson. I'm
about to introduce the independent practice task, which is to write a postcard
in French which includes the near future tense. I'm confident that pupils have
the knowledge and skills required to access the task. We've been learning about
how to use the near future tense in this lesson. Pupils have written postcards
in French as part of previous lessons, so they're familiar with the key features
of this type of writing. And in a previous lesson, pupils learned vocabulary and
phrases including hobbies and holiday activities.

<em>
  “Today, we've been learning about how to use the near future tense to talk
  about our future plans. We have practised adapting sentences from the present
  tense into the near future, and you've also practised writing your own
  sentences using the near future tense. So I think you're ready for something a
  little bit more challenging, and we're going to write a postcard using that
  near future tense.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Imagine that you're on holiday and you're writing a postcard home to your best
  friend. So all of that vocabulary that we learned about what you do in your
  free time and what you do on holidays, you can use it here.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I've also given you a list of infinitives that you can use too. I want you to
  write four sentences in total in your postcard.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Use the present tense to talk about what you're doing now. Use the perfect
  tense to talk about what you did yesterday. And use the near future tense to
  talk about what you will do tomorrow. And I want you to do two sentences using
  the near future tense. So that's four sentences in total.
</em>

<em>
  So how many sentences do I want you to write in the present tense? Ben?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>
  Exactly. How many sentences do we need to write in the perfect tense? Sarah?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>Spot on. And how many sentences in the near future tense? Princess? </em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>

<em>Perfect. And what vocabulary can you use to help you? Iris? </em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct answer] </em>

<em>
  Great. So 10 minutes working in silence, off we go. I want to draw your
  attention to a couple of things in that model.”{" "}
</em>

First, the task clearly gets pupils to think about what I need them to learn. For this lesson, pupils are learning how to use the near future tense. In this task, pupils are required to write two sentences in the near future tense. I drew attention to this by explicitly naming the tenses that they should use. In this part of my instruction, notice how I began each sentence by telling pupils what tense to use. Use the present tense. Use the perfect tense. Use the near future tense. We tend to notice things that repeat. In this case, that means noticing the focus on which tense they should write in. Even in the task instructions, I'm encouraging them to think about the learning goal.

Secondly, I designed this practice task to provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting this work. They were using vocabulary that they know they're secure in, and they had a list of infinitives to use. By providing this scaffolding, we help to manage the cognitive load of the lesson content so pupils can focus on the key learning, in this case, accurate use of the near future tense. This is a challenging task because pupils are having to apply previously learned content and new content. But the supports that I've provided should prevent it from being overwhelming.

Finally, before setting pupils off on the task, I asked a couple of questions to check that they had understood. Again, my questions focused on the content that I wanted them to think particularly hard about. Pupils were clear about what they needed to do and were supported to do it well.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Andrews is getting better at identifying and conveying what he wants his pupils to learn. But while his checks for understanding reveal pupils have understood what he has taught, he notices that pupils are not yet able to securely grasp and apply key ideas independently. How can his instruction support pupils to consolidate their learning?

## Key idea

Providing opportunities for purposeful practice supports pupils to consolidate and secure what they have learned.

## Evidence summary

### Learning is about remembering and connecting information

Mr Andrews now understands that ‘learning is the residue of thought’ (Willingham, 2009). In particular, what people have thought hard about (Coe, 2013). Thinking takes place in working memory where people combine knowledge from their long-term memory with new information (Willingham, 2009). To commit new information to long-term memory, pupils must have a strong foundation of prior knowledge.

Pupils consolidate their existing knowledge by retrieving it from long-term memory and using it to answer questions or solve problems (Roediger & Butler, 2011). This allows them to process new information faster and more accurately (Sweller, 2016). For example, they can comprehend new information by linking it with familiar words or ideas. What can Mr Andrews do to support pupils to successfully consolidate material?

### Practice supports successful remembering and connecting

Regular purposeful practice consolidates pupils’ understanding and helps them remember key ideas. Practice can happen in the ‘We do’ as well as the ‘You do’ parts of instruction. Initially, teachers should scaffold practice as part of ‘We do’ (Lemov, 2015), for example by solving problems with pupils, to show them how to complete problems. Over time, teachers can decrease the support they offer to help pupils practise independently (IES, 2008).

Independent practice tasks (‘You do’) (Lemov, 2015) should relate closely to those covered in guided practice. Otherwise pupils may struggle and waste time identifying what to do (Kirschner et al., in Christodoulou, 2017). This also allows pupils to focus on becoming more fluent at solving a problem or recalling information (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, if the guided practice has been about adding fractions, this should also be the focus of independent practice, rather than adding _and_ subtracting fractions.

Over time, practice should support the development of expertise by consolidating mental models, as thinking hard secures memories and makes new connections. This helps pupils to free up their working memory to tackle more complicated problems (Sweller, 2016). For example, practising times tables allows pupils to tackle more advanced maths problems more easily.

For practice to be effective, teachers need to ensure pupils achieve a high success rate, ideally of around 80% (Rosenshine, 2012). Mr Andrews needs to ensure that where pupils are not regularly successful in their practice, he intervenes with feedback which pupils can act on. He can also acknowledge and praise pupil effort and emphasise progress made toward eventual success. High levels of success also improve pupils’ motivation (Coe et al., 2014).

### Effective approaches to independent practice

After introducing content in small steps, supported through models and guided instruction, Mr Andrews now needs to get his pupils to practise independently. How should he organise and ‘space’ this practice over time?

- Spacing practice over time (or ‘distributing’ it) makes learning feel harder but improves pupils’ retention because they have to think harder about it (Dunlosky et al., 2013).
- Assuming pupils are getting questions right, teachers can increase the intervals between practice (Dunlosky et al., 2013).

Mr Andrews should be intentional in not just how he spaces practice but what he includes in practice. He should consider not just what he has recently taught but also supporting pupils to master challenging content which builds towards long term goals. Therefore, pupils should practise skills and knowledge from previous weeks and months. He can increase the challenge by removing scaffolding, lengthening spaces or introducing interacting elements, for example a more complicated problem where one step relies on a previous step.

While practice matters, “not all practice is equivalent” (Deans for Impact, 2015). Setting up pupils for independent practice might involve Mr Andrews giving his pupils a set of problems to solve but it could also involve teaching them to self-quiz. Testing is among the most effective techniques for supporting pupils to remember what they have learned (Pan et al., 2018). Retrieval is also more effective than other independent study activities such as re-reading and highlighting (Dunlosky et al., 2013) because it requires pupils to think hard.

### Nuances and caveats

While increasing time gaps between practice is beneficial for learning, this is not always practical. It depends how long pupils need to recall this information for. For example, to remember something for one week, practice should be spaced 12 to 24 hours apart. Whereas, to remember something for five years, practice should be spaced 6 to 12 months apart (Dunlosky et al., 2013).

Lots of practice at once (cramming) can be effective if pupils know very little and want to pass an exam – however, this is not an appropriate strategy if we want them to remember these ideas the following year or beyond.

Homework might be a good opportunity for further practice of what has been learnt in class. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of the homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set (EEF, 2018).

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>A key aim for teachers is to help pupils to
remember and use what they learn in the future. We want them to be able to work independently.
In order to get there, pupils need to acquire a body of knowledge and skills, which
they can use to solve a range of problems. Explicitly teaching knowledge and skills
can be beneficial. This doesn't mean that pupils are passive in the process. Instead
it recognizes that pupils need support in order to move from dependence to independence.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Explicit teaching describes a particular approach to instruction and it's underpinned
by what we know about how pupils learn. Explicit teaching means introducing new material
in steps working through that material with pupils to check they understand it and
gradually withdrawing support so that they can work through it on their own. The
I, We, You model is one way of thinking about this. I teach you something we go through
it together and you have a go on your own.

There may be some overlap between stages but the ‘I phase’ broadly matches with teacher exposition. The ‘We phase’ is assessing and responding. And the ‘You phase’ is independent practice. Explicit teaching matches instruction to pupils starting points and gives them the support needed to learn the important knowledge and skills of the subject over time. The academic Barak Rosenshine has written extensively about explicit teaching. He argues that most effective teachers ensure that <em>"pupils acquire, rehearse and connect background knowledge through a great deal of instructional support"</em>.

Teachers can carry out explicit teaching by following the I, We, You model. This involves applying many of the principles of how pupils learn. For example, it's important during the I part to start instruction at the point of current pupil understanding. Teachers also need to consider how to break new material into small manageable steps, concrete examples, partially complete examples often called worked examples, guides and scaffolds can be powerful methods of showing pupils new material.

Then there is the We phase of the model. At the heart of explicit teaching is questioning, lots and lots of questioning. Teachers can use questions to encourage pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion.  Once material has been taught. Teachers need to ask themselves, what have pupils understood? Are there any gaps in their understanding? Do I need to explain this bit again? Do they have any misconceptions? They can then use what they find out to adapt their teaching in response. They might need to reteach something provide another example or correct a misconception. The We part is a good time for this. Although teachers can of course ask questions and respond during other phases too.

Once pupils have acquired some new knowledge or skills and teachers have checked that it's secure, pupils need to have lots of opportunities to practise it. The You part of the model, where pupils practise on their own, is just as important as the I or the We phase. Put another way: independent practice is just as important as teacher expositions and assessing and responding.

Teachers need to get the balance right between exposition repetition, practice, and retrieval of critical skills. They also need to accept that this instructional model may extend over more than one lesson. Lessons or periods are arbitrary ways of breaking up learning. It might be completely appropriate to only get through the I and We phases and get pupils to practise independently at another time.

Explicit teaching is a really effective way of guiding pupil learning. This doesn't mean pupils should be passive recipients of knowledge. In a subject like English for example. Getting pupils to share their personal response to a text is a key skill that we want them to develop. It's part of the joy of reading, but if the pupil can't understand the words in the text or is confused by some of the references the text makes, it may be difficult for them to come up with a response.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you'll see an Ambition Institute Coach model a short I, We,
You sequence, to take you through the key stages of explicit teaching. As you watch
pay particular attention to how the coach does the following:
<ul>
  <li>Links what pupils already know to what is being taught</li>
  <li>
    Makes the steps in a process memorable and ensures pupils can recall them
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourages pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so
    that misconceptions can be addressed
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
I'm about to take you through a short sequence of learning using the I, We, You
model. So that you can see what explicit teaching looks like in practice.
Imagine that I'm teaching a year three French lesson. We've been studying the
French version of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" This is lesson six of eight and
pupils are writing sentences about foods that they like.

<em>“So today we're going to write sentences about the foods that we like. </em>

<em>Yesterday we learned loads of new words for different types of food. </em>

<em>
  Today, we're going to practise those new words by using them in sentences.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I model mine. Then we'll do one together. And then you'll write your sentences
  in your exercise books.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So first, I'm going to choose a food that I like. I'm going to choose because
  I like apples.{" "}
</em>

<em>Second, I'm going to say my sentence in English. I like apples. </em>

<em>
  Third, I'm going to choose the word for I like, which is j'aime and practise
  saying my sentence: j'aime les pommes. I like apples. Now I write my sentence
  in French [teacher writes on white board]: j'aime les pommes. I like apples.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Finally, I need to check that I've included the word for the. I need to write
  les pommes as in French you would say, I like the apples. Pommes would be
  incorrect.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now, let's try one together. Mackenzie, first of all, can you tell me a food
  that you like from the foods that we identified in the book.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
  Sweets, let's say that sentence in English Mackenzie. I like sweets. What's
  the word for I like in French? Hannah.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
  Yes, well done. Les bonbon means I like. Let's say that sentence out loud,
  Adam.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil answers]</em>

<em>
  J'aime bonbon. Let's check. Have we included the word for the? So let's
  correct that Adam. J'aime les bonon. Great. Now let's say that together.
  "J'aime les bonbon"{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Brilliant, now I'll write it on the board [teacher writes on white board].
  J'aime les bonbon.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Let's do one more check. Which sentence is correct? Is it one: j'aime les
  bonbon, or is it two: j'aime bonon? Show me with your fingers in three, two,
  one.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Pupils hold up fingers to show their answer. Teacher scans whole class]
</em>

<em>You've all said one, which is correct. It includes the word les. </em>

<em>
  I want you to write your own sentences in your exercise books. Included the
  word bank on the board with some of the words in English and the words in
  French. And you also have a sentence starter in your exercise books from
  earlier. If you need it.”
</em>

This is a short sequence that demonstrates how you can guide pupil learning. To begin with I made sure that I connected what pupils already knew, to what was being taught. Pupils were using vocabulary that they had learned in a previous lesson to write sentences.

During the I phase, I modelled a good answer to pupils on the board. And made the steps in the process memorable by numbering them and using the same steps in the I phase as the We phase.

Asking specific pupils to contribute a response to each step in the task, helped them to recall them. It also enables me to check that pupils understood the task. I knew what knowledge and skills to draw on.

Finally, I encouraged pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion, so that I could check for misconceptions. I asked the whole class the question to see if they had remembered that they need to add the word for the: Les. Pupils often forget to add the definite article. By checking what pupils understand I can correct mistakes before they practise on their own.

In this example, the I and We phases of the sequence helped me to feel confidence that pupils were ready to work independently. They will still have to think hard during independent practice but guiding and checking their thinking beforehand will increase the likelihood of success.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Sims understands that several strategies contribute to effective instruction. But sometimes, when considering how to use these strategies in combination, she notices that she is unsure how they fit together. When does pupil misunderstanding mean she should use more teacher talk? When do pupils need more practice? Is there an overall model of instruction which can help her review her lessons to decide if her instruction is supporting pupils to learn as effectively as they can?

## Key idea

Teachers should deploy instructional strategies that provide most teacher support early in the instructional sequence and gradually withdraw this support to ensure pupils successfully gain knowledge and skills.

## Evidence summary

### Explicit teaching of knowledge and skills is teacher-led

Explicit teaching means teachers provide fully guided instruction to pupils when introducing new knowledge and skills (Sweller, 2016). Ms Sims chooses to pursue explicit teaching because it is the most efficient way to develop her pupils’ mental models – the collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which comprise their understanding of a topic or a subject. To build these mental models, Ms Sims can combine a variety of techniques.

One model which can be helpful when thinking about how to sequence these techniques is the ‘I-We-You' approach (Lemov, 2015). When pupils begin learning a topic or skill, they benefit from first receiving guided instruction from the teacher, as opposed to discovering key ideas for themselves (Coe et al., 2014).

One reason this approach is effective is because working memory is limited. If pupils have to discover the key ideas themselves, or complete a complicated process with limited guidance, they will find it difficult to do and to remember. However, teachers can make this process easier through an effective ‘I do’, for example linking to pupil prior knowledge, addressing common misconceptions and introducing material in steps through explanations and models. As pupils acquire knowledge and skills, their expertise increases, and Ms Sims can encourage them to work increasingly independently, first with teacher support (‘We do’) and then practising alone (‘You do’) to gain mastery. Such a sequence makes it more likely pupils will be successful (Rosenshine, 2012).

### 'I do’ - effective teacher exposition

So how can Ms Sims provide adequate guidance to pupils when introducing new material? During the ‘I do’ section of the lesson, Ms Sims can help her pupils grasp new ideas by introducing new material in steps and crafting careful explanations (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010) using worked and partially worked examples or models (Pashler et al., 2007; Rosenshine, 2012).

However, it would be a mistake for Ms Sims to believe teacher guided instruction means no thinking or input from pupils. During the ‘I do’, reviewing previous learning both helps pupils recall useful prior knowledge and helps her to decide how much guidance pupils need and in which areas (Rosenshine, 2012). She should allow pupils to practise after each new step has been introduced and ask questions to help students process new material from her exposition. This will ensure pupils are thinking hard about new knowledge and skills and connecting them to previous learning (Rosenshine, 2012).

### Assessing before moving on

Explaining, modelling and questioning pupils – developing their mental models – before individual practice, tends to be most effective (Rosenshine, 2012). However, if Ms Sims wants her pupils to learn efficiently, she must balance the risks of falling into two opposite traps: spending too long explaining ideas to pupils (‘I do’) or moving too quickly to practice (‘We do’ or ‘You do’) without first assessing whether pupils need further guidance.

This can be tricky because we cannot see mental models developing. Just because a pupil looks busy or writes lots, it does not necessarily mean that they have learnt something (Coe, 2013). Learning something can also take time, with pupils typically benefiting more from experiencing multiple exposures to information, ideally spaced out over time (Pashler et al., 2007).

Ms Sims can use diagnostic assessments to inform her decisions about teaching. She can do this by thinking carefully about the specific knowledge and skills she wants her pupils to acquire and using questions to which all or most pupils to respond. This will enable her to get an impression of whether pupils have acquired the intended knowledge and skills (Christodoulou, 2017), and what to do next with them.

### ‘We do, You do’ - guided practice, independent practice

When Ms Sims transitions to the ‘We do’ section, she should avoid removing all support immediately. Her key consideration should be that pupils obtain a high success rate, ideally of around 80%: initially, she can provide scaffolds to achieve this and check for understanding (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, Ms Sims could invite students to rehearse new material by rephrasing, elaborating or summarising (Rosenshine, 2012). She can also provide guides and scaffolds for trickier tasks to ensure pupils do not become overwhelmed by trying to practise too much complex material too soon (Rosenshine, 2012).

But the ‘You do’ stage of independent practice is also important for pupil learning. Ms. Sims should continue to check for understanding and, when appropriate, remove scaffolds and guidance so that pupils can practise independently (Pashler et al., 2007). A key goal of independent practice is for pupils to gain automaticity so they can effortlessly use their knowledge and skills (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Sims may tell pupils that they need to ‘practise beyond the point when they get it right, to the point where they can’t get it wrong’.

### Nuances and caveats

I-We-You offers valuable guidance for sequencing learning, but it is not a rule: it is not equally appropriate across all subjects and phases. An I-We-You structure supports learning across individual lessons but can also be used in shorter cycles within a lesson, or over several lessons.

The expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, 2007) means that as pupils gain knowledge and skills, too much support can stop them using what they already know. As a result, it is important that teachers check for understanding to ensure they are not ‘over-scaffolding' learning, withdrawing support as appropriate.

<h3>Presenter intro</h3>
Learning new or complex material can feel difficult and off-putting, but instead
of simply making a task easier, we need to provide supports that will help pupils
to access this challenging content. This is called scaffolding. Much like scaffolding
on a building, it helps pupils to access parts of learning that they might struggle
to get to on their own. It also needs to be removed once it has done its job. Scaffolding
is a necessary but temporary support.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
We define scaffolding as a temporary aid used to support pupils with their learning.
Scaffolds, like those used on buildings, allow pupils to reach areas that they would
struggle to get to without help. Once they've served their purpose, they're removed.
The aim of scaffolding is to gradually transfer responsibility of a task or learning
from the teacher to the pupils.

When scaffolding is in place, teachers can establish high expectations and set challenging work knowing that the scaffold will make it more manageable. When content might be complex or abstract, scaffolds help pupils to experience success and allow them to access ambitious end goals. It is important that scaffolds support the right things and that they are gradually withdrawn.

A useful way of thinking about this is to compare how a balance bike for children works as compared to stabilizers. When children learn how to ride a bike, they need to learn how to balance on two wheels first. Stabilizers do the work of balancing, meaning that children focus first on learning how to pedal, but that isn't what they need to master first. On the other hand, a balance bike simply removes the pedals. It allows children to practice balancing before working out how to pedal. In this case, the absence of pedals acts as a scaffold. Children can concentrate on what they need to learn, the balancing, without the added complexity of pedalling. A balance bike scaffolds the right thing. Teachers need to check what job their scaffold is doing.

When planning to introduce a scaffold, teachers can ask themselves a series of questions, such as the following: what do I want my pupils to think about? What will they be able to do on their own and what will they need help with? What might get in the way? Does the scaffold remove the obstacle, or does it replace the thinking?

Remember, scaffolds shouldn't replace the thinking that you want pupils to do, and they need to be withdrawn gradually. Teachers can carry out scaffolds in a variety of ways.

Modelling is one form of scaffolding. Modelling helps to show pupils the most effective way to answer a problem or to carry out a task. Another scaffold that might be used are checklists. Checklists support pupils to attend to numerous aspects of their work. A teacher might also provide a list of key vocabulary on the boards. When a pupil gives an answer in their own non-specialist's words, the teacher can ask them to rephrase their response using the disciplinary language on the boards. Here, pupils are doing the hard work of thinking about a response, and the list of words forms a scaffold that allows them to articulate their ideas more precisely. Worked examples are another scaffold that might be useful. Worked examples, where pupils go through a partially complete example with their teacher, helps pupils to see the steps taken in solving a problem.

Regardless of the technique used as a scaffold, they should be temporary in nature. As pupils begin to achieve a high success rate, scaffolding should be removed. Otherwise, pupils might become reliant on the support and not be able to access the content independently. In some instances, scaffolds may actually inhibit learning. Where pupils have gained expertise, practice and independent activities without scaffolds, might be more effective for pupil learning.

When we get scaffolds right and fade them out over time, our pupils feel supported, achieve success, and are setup to have a go on their own.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see an Ambition Institute Coach model a specific scaffolding
strategy. As you watch, look out for how they do the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough
    support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting
    challenging work
  </li>
  <li>
    Removes scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success
    in applying previously taught material
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
For the purposes of this model, imagine I'm teaching a Year Nine Biology Class
about osmosis. I've taught the topic, and I want to give them another
opportunity to practice what they've learned. From previous assessments, the
group's understanding of the science is good, but they are struggling to use the
key scientific terminology. I've therefore provided a scaffold of key words on
the board. Firstly, to help improve the accuracy of their verbal answers and
then written answers in their workbook. After this lesson, having read their
definitions, I'll decide if I can remove the scaffold partially or completely
depending on their use of this vocabulary in their written work. Pupils have
completed a starter activity recapping what we learned last lesson, and I'm now
asking them, using cold call, to describe what happens to a red blood cell
that's placed in pure water.

<em>
  “So what happens to a red blood cell in pure water? In your answer, I'd like
  you to make use of the key scientific terminology on the board, and I'm now
  going to give you 30 seconds to think about your answer. Okay, Molly, could
  you share your answer with us please? What happens to a red blood cell in pure
  water?
</em>

<em>
  [Molly answers: A red blood cell would get bigger in pure water because it is
  taking the water into it across it’s partially permeable membrane, because of
  osmosis happening]
</em>

<em>Great, and what does the term osmosis mean? </em>

<em>[</em>
<em>
  Molly answers: Osmosis is where water diffuses from an area of higher water
  concentration to an area of low concentration]
</em>

<em>
  Thank you, Molly. So that's an accurate definition, and you've made good use
  of the word bank here. Is there anything on here that you could use instead of
  the term get bigger? And try and put that into a full sentence for me.
</em>

<em>[Molly answers: the red blood cell would ‘swell up’]</em>

<em>
  There are lots of great things about Molly's answer. It's scientifically
  correct, and she's described the direction the water will travel in and the
  effect this will have on the cell. Also, she's used the key scientific
  terminology here to describe what happens to the membrane. How could we
  further improve Molly's answer? Use the words in the word bank, and take 30
  seconds thinking time, off you go. So can we improve on Molly's answer using
  the key terminology? Mitchell.
</em>

<em>
  [Mitchell answers: During osmosis, water diffuses from an area of higher water
  concentration to an area of lower water concentration. A red blood cell in
  pure water would swell up and eventually burst, known as lysis. This is
  because the concentration of water is higher in the pure water, when compared
  to the red blood cell and so the water will move into the red blood cell,
  across it’s partially permeable membrane, until it cannot fit any more water
  and bursts]
</em>

<em>
  That's great, thank you, Mitchell. So you added the key words, such as water
  concentration, swell up, and lysis, and using these terms has really allowed
  you to explain what happens during osmosis more accurately. Let's see if we
  can get more of this key terminology into our answer. Where could we add
  concentration gradient? I'll give you 30 seconds thinking time. Okay, can we
  improve on Mitchell's answer using the term concentration gradient? Hannah.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Hannah’s answer: we can add it to the definition of osmosis, so, during
  osmosis, water diffuses from an area of higher water concentration to an area
  of lower water concentration, along its concentration gradient]
</em>

<em>
  Perfect. So we've now demonstrated that we understand every aspect of osmosis,
  and we can describe as well as explain what's happening. I'd now like you to
  answer a similar question in your workbooks, and the question and the word
  bank are in your books. Off you go.”
</em>

Let's unpack this model. First, I helped pupils achieve a high success rate by ensuring that the task was manageable. Pupils had a good understanding of osmosis and were able to explain it in their own words. This activity took them a step further using academic vocabulary to refine their thinking.

Secondly, the scaffold I used supports pupils who need more structure early in their learning. As this is still new content, recalling what osmosis is and a wide range of scientific vocabulary, is a lot to hold onto at once. The word bank makes the task more accessible and enables them to come up with a more accurate definition. Importantly though, it doesn't get in the way of the thinking that I need them to do, recalling the process of osmosis.

Finally, I thought about how to remove this scaffold. Once pupils are able to use this terminology fluently providing a word bank may hinder their thinking, and so it's important I take it away as soon as possible. Scaffolds are a useful support, but they shouldn't remain in place indefinitely.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones is increasingly confident at using the I-We-You model to lead sequences of instruction. But he finds that some of his pupils become overwhelmed by new content and many pupils struggle when the ideas are abstract or complex. How can his instruction support pupils to be successful when tackling challenging material?

## Key idea

Effective scaffolding gives pupils the knowledge and guidance to access challenging content but should be removed once pupils are experiencing high rates of success.

## Evidence summary

### Knowledge, new content and the role of scaffolding

Mr Jones now understands that to learn new content pupils need to be able to process it in their working memory, but that working memory capacity is limited and varies between pupils (Gathercole et al., 2006). Related knowledge helps pupils make sense of new content (Willingham, 2009). For example, pupil vocabulary knowledge allows them to process strings of letters as sentences when reading and knowledge of phonics helps them when they encounter an unfamiliar word, reducing the demands on working memory. Prior knowledge reduces the burden on working memory and frees it up to think about more challenging concepts. Where prior knowledge is lacking, further support through scaffolding can help, for example by providing a definition and pronunciation of an unfamiliar key word. But where pupils already have this knowledge, scaffolding can get in the way of pupils using their prior knowledge (Pashler et al., 2007).

Prior knowledge helps us to grasp related new ideas more easily, particularly if the new ideas are concrete, as most of the things we know are concrete. However, many of the ideas encountered at school are abstract, and distant from pupils’ everyday experiences (Willingham, 2009). When introducing abstract ideas, teachers can provide related scaffolds that make the ideas more concrete. This reduces the chances of working memory becoming overloaded, increasing the chances of pupil success. For example, the idea of adding fractions can be abstract, but we can make it more concrete by using objects or diagrams (Pashler et al., 2007).

### Introducing scaffolding

Scaffolding can be introduced to support pupils to succeed with difficult tasks where they lack sufficient prior knowledge. Scaffolding involves breaking down tasks into manageable steps and providing temporary supports. This enables pupils to focus on and think about only certain aspects of the task at any one time, reducing the chances of working memory being overloaded.

Mr Jones should try to anticipate what his pupils with struggle with most, break down the task into manageable steps, and then decide what kinds of scaffolding he might put in place.

He can draw on a few different types of scaffold to support pupil thinking and make his ‘expert thinking’ explicit:

- **Modelling:** For example, sharing an excellent piece of work or ‘thinking aloud’ through a problem (Rosenshine, 2012). Mr Jones can reduce the cognitive burden his pupils feel by directing pupil attention towards the key features of a problem or example. This can help them to break down a complex task into more manageable parts.
- **Worked examples:** When introducing a new type of problem in maths, Mr Jones could break the problem down into steps instead of getting his pupils to attempt it in one go. He could then guide them through each step by providing prompts or explanations which would help the pupils succeed at each step. Worked examples reduce the number of options pupils need to think about by pointing them directly to successful approaches (Sweller, 2016).
- **Guides:** Teachers can also anticipate common pupil mistakes and misconceptions and provide guides such as checklists as support to overcome these (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, when teaching his pupils creative writing, Mr Jones could give his pupils a checklist of things they should include. This means that pupils do not have to simultaneously think about both what they want to write and the complex devices they need to use. Checklists also support them to review their work to avoid common errors like leaving out full stops and misconceptions like every ‘s’ should have an apostrophe.

### Removing scaffolding

Scaffolds need to be temporary to successfully support learning. As pupil knowledge develops, using fewer examples and more problem solving appears to improve learning, rather than continuing to provide high levels of guidance (Pashler et al., 2007). As pupils develop more knowledge, trying to process the scaffolding at the same time as drawing on their existing knowledge can overload working memory. As a result, scaffolding is best removed as pupils’ knowledge grows. Rather than removing all the scaffolds at once, however, Mr Jones can gradually ‘fade’ them out by removing support gradually, as pupils begin to experience higher success rates (Rosenshine, 2012).

Effective scaffolding increases the chances of pupils experiencing success and improves pupil motivation (Coe et al., 2014). Success should be a central guiding principle when deciding whether and when to remove scaffolding as pupil expertise increases.

### Nuances and caveats

Scaffolding alone cannot overcome limitations in pupil prior knowledge. Strategies like explicitly teaching content and allowing pupils to rehearse this new knowledge are necessary to ensure pupils have adequate knowledge (Rosenshine, 2012).

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
Questioning is an essential tool for teachers. Questions can be used to develop understanding
as well as to check understanding. Good questions can guide pupils' thinking and
get them to draw upon what they know. They can also help teachers to see how knowledge
is taking shape and if there are any gaps or misunderstandings. Whether you're designing
a question to develop understanding or to check it, teachers need to plan what they
will ask and know why they're asking it.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Questioning is a hugely important part of classroom practice. It's really important
to have a clear purpose in mind when you ask a question. You're probably already
asking your pupils lots of questions, but are you planning them carefully to ensure
that they're the best ones?

Effective questions can help to develop pupil understanding by directing thinking or extending thinking. Questions can also help teachers to check what pupils understand. Teachers can use a range of different types of questions.

First, let's think about questions that develop pupil thinking by helping to direct what they think about. Closed questions are questions where there's a specific answer. Closed questions can be used to get pupils to recall prior knowledge. How many children did Henry the Eighth have? They can help pupils to notice important details. Where is the topic sentence in this paragraph? And closed questions can help pupils to connect concrete ideas to abstract ones. A key concept in maths is that it doesn't matter what order you add things up in, the answer would always be the same. This is an abstract concept called commutative property. A concrete idea that helps pupils to understand this is to add up two sets of beads. As they do so, a teacher might ask these specific questions,<em> "show on your fingers what answer do you get if you add these three beads to these seven beads? 10, let's switch round the order, what answer do you get, if you add these seven beads to these three beads? 10 again. Does it matter what order you add the beads up in? Daniel? What can you tell me about the order that we can add numbers up in? We were talking about it yesterday. Casia?"</em> Questions about the beads, a concrete support, help pupils to understand commutative property, this abstract concept.

Second, teachers can ask questions that extend pupil thinking by asking open ended questions. Open ended questions have more than one answer. One fairly straight forward type of open ended question is to use the word why. In an earlier setting for example, a teacher might interact with the pupil during play and ask a question like, why did you choose to add a tower to your castle? There could be many different reasons, unique to each pupil. These open ended questions can help pupil to share their opinions, reflect on and understand themselves. Open questions can push pupils to draw upon more of their knowledge. What impact did the opening of the international fast food chain have on Nigeria? How does Shakespeare present Lady Macbeth relationship with Macbeth in this scene? Explain why the stone sinks, but the boat floats? In order to ask these questions accurately pupils will need to draw on a wide body of knowledge and teachers should think carefully about the knowledge a question requires.

Finally, teachers can use questions to check for understanding. To be effective, teachers need to know what specific content they're testing for. What knowledge do they want to see if their pupils have? What misconceptions are they checking for? When designing your question include the subject specific vocabulary that you want pupils to acquire and remind them to use specific language in their answer. For example, in a key stage one class on pollination, you might ask,<em> "what part of the flower does pollen need to move to during pollination?"</em> Making reference to explicit vocabulary expected helps you to check pupils' understanding more precisely. With a finite amount of time on their hands, teachers need to have a clear purpose in mind when designing questions.

And whether your question is to develop understanding or to check for understanding, you need to get all of your pupil to think about the answer. When teachers ask a question to one pupil, it can be tempting for others to switch off, but in order to learn, pupils need to think. Teachers need to establish a clear expectation that everyone tries to answer the questions that they hear, even if they're not called on to answer. One way that teachers can do this is to ask a question to the whole class, naming the pupil after you've asked the question means more pupil are likely to think about the answer, than when teachers direct a question to one pupil. So instead of saying, <em>"Ryan, how many sizes a square have?" </em>It's better to say, <em>"How many sides does a square have? Ryan?"</em> This tiny switch can make a huge difference, particularly if pupils understand why teachers are taking this approach and if the routine has been set up effectively, for instance, <em>"no hands up, we all need to think." </em>You also need to leave enough time between asking a question and getting the answer so that pupils can think about their response carefully. Try counting one, two, three in your head after you pose a question.

Good questions can significantly enhance both the quality and the accuracy of pupil thought. Think carefully about the primary function of your question, what you will ask and how your deliver it.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In this example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model how to ask a series
of questions to check for understanding. As you watch focus on the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Structures tasks and questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions
  </li>
  <li>
    Checks that pupils have a secure understanding by encouraging them to
    elaborate when responding to questions
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplificatin: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>I want you to imagine I'm
teaching a year 12 English lesson. Will be learning about John Keats Odes and
today returned to the poem To Autumn. We've defined odes as lyrical poems that
celebrate people, places, things, or ideas. We've also considered that poets
have purposes for their art and that case is presenting an argument in defence
of season of autumn. We have a routine of no hands up in the class and all
pupils expect to be called upon. Pupils have just completed an activity where
they've worked independently to identify the imagery that tells about Keats'
perspective on autumn. Now I'm checking for understanding to assess whether
pupils are right to move on to the next phase of instruction.

<em>
  “Right. I'm going to ask you some questions now, so listen carefully and
  remember hands down. What is an ode?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives correct definition of an ode]</em>

<em>
  Reese, absolutely, an ode is a lyrical poem that celebrates people, places,
  things or ideas. Reese, can you give me an example of where Keats is
  celebrating autumn in the poem?{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Pupil answer: swollen gourds and ‘plump’ hazel. They are full and ready to
  burst]
</em>

<em>
  Right, the first stanza, the stroll fee is celebratory tone. And last lesson,
  we also said that Keats seems to go even further by being almost like a
  defence for autumn, such as not following lines here: “where the songs are
  spring, Ay, where are they? Think not of them that hast thy music too.” Keats
  seems to be celebrating and defending autumn against the other seasons here.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now let's take a look at this quatrain from the second stanza, the
  antistrophe: “and sometimes like a gleaner that does keep, steady thy laden
  and head across a brook or by a cyder press with patient look, thou watchest
  the last oozings hours by hours.” I find these lines somewhat paradoxical in
  tone, why is that? Bola?{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Pupil answers: on the one hand there is a bit of a feeling of tiredness and
  things coming to an end, and on the other hand the ode is rejoicing in things
  coming into life]
</em>

<em>
  Great, we still see the celebration of autumn, despite some of the language
  choices, for example, laden and oozings. And also that extra 11th line in each
  stanza, Bola, so we said that when something is paradoxical, it contradicts
  another aspect. Is there anything else here that feels contradictory or out of
  place to the rest of the celebratory tone that would expect in an ode?{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Pupil answers: it feels like autumn is moving quite slowly, it steadies its
  hand and gives a ‘patient’ look. This is different from the energy of some of
  the fruits bursting into life]{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So there is an authentic tone as if awaiting for something to happen, linking
  to the somnambulistic imagery that we came across earlier in the stanza, for
  example, sound asleep and drowsed. And though Keats celebrates autumn in this
  moment and wants to capture it, the last oozings hours by hours that will give
  way to into soon. And we said that this is a typical trope of Keats' poetry
  and his fears of middle age and death. I want you to draw your attention to a
  couple of things in that model.”
</em>

Firstly, you may have noticed I paused and scanned the room before identifying the pupil that I wanted to answer the question. This for a few reasons. It gave everyone time to think about the response, as they didn't know who was going to ask and it meant that I could check that everyone was listening to me and thinking. I wanted to check that pupils knew what an ode was and to ensure that their understanding was secure. My initial questions check that they could identify the features of an ode and then I asked them to explain where they could see this in the poem before moving on.

I also checked for specific knowledge gaps and misconceptions. When learning about odes, students often miss the complexities and nuance in tone, for example, only looking for where the poem is celebratory. I wanted students to both consider the main aspects of Keats' argument and this important definition of an ode, but I also wanted to develop their understanding of the details that are more subtle and the link to the poet's purpose across the odes they've studied.

When planning questions, I find that it helps to do it in reverse. First I decide what I want to check for then I design a question and finally, I test out the question on myself to make sure that it targets specifically what I wanted to. This helps me get the most out of questioning in the classroom.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video we have considered the different purposes, the questions can serve
and how to deliver them in the classroom. Before we finish, take a moment now to
read over the key ideas. Which ideas did the example best illustrate?
<ul>
  <li>
    Structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps
    and misconceptions
  </li>
  <li>
    Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and
    challenge pupils
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more
    developed responses are required
  </li>
  <li>
    Prompt pupils to elaborate on their answers to check that a correct answer
    stems from secure understanding
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Effective teachers ask lots of questions during their teaching, but perhaps more
importantly, they don't do this at random. To get the most out of questions, you
need to know why you're asking them and design them carefully. Really good
questions benefit from advanced planning. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Aswin feels confident he can lead I-We-You (Lemov, 2015) sequences and help pupils access and practise complex content. However, he notices that pupils are getting used to being ‘spoon fed’ and are quite dependent on him to do the ‘hard thinking’ before they get to independent practice. How can his instruction transfer more of the thinking onto pupils earlier in the learning sequence?

## Key idea

Effective questioning can guide pupil thinking through checking understanding, extending pupil thinking and fostering high-quality talk in a supportive classroom environment.

## Evidence summary

### Checking for understanding

Questioning is an essential tool for teachers to master as it can be used for many purposes (Coe et al., 2014). For example, it is among the most effective ways for Mr Ashwin to elicit what his pupils are thinking (Black & Wiliam, 2009). Sometimes Mr Ashwin checks pupil understanding by asking questions which demand short, simple answers. For example, he may want to see if pupils have enough fluent prior knowledge by asking ‘what is 8 x 7?’ Targeting questions at several pupils could also help Mr Ashwin make an inference about current class understanding and any common misconceptions.

Such questioning is diagnostic: it is primarily about finding out what pupils know rather than building pupil knowledge (Black & Wiliam, 2009). However, things can go wrong if the questions don’t check the right things or if only a few pupils are questioned and information from these answers determine the subsequent direction of the lesson. Teachers can also inadvertently ignore the information generated from questions if they have not planned carefully when to pose them and how to respond to them. When planning questions to check pupil understanding, Mr Ashwin should consider:

- What is the key knowledge that I need to check in this lesson? What do pupils need to be secure in before I can move on? What will they say and do if they are secure with this?
- What is the best way to get the widest sample of answers? For example, mini whiteboards, exit tasks or post-it notes cans help quickly gather information about most of the class.
- What are the wrong answers and misconceptions that might arise in the lesson? How will I prepare to address them?

### Extending pupil thinking

Questioning can help Mr Ashwin develop pupil thinking as well as check it. Studies have shown that more effective teachers ask more questions and often require pupils to give extended explanations of their thought process (Rosenshine, 2012).

Sequences of open questions can help to manage pupils’ limited working memory. For example, when introducing a maths problem Mr Ashwin could ask:

‘What would we do first?’

‘Why would we do this first?’

‘Once we have done that, what might we do next? Why’

Such questions require pupils to explain their answers which encourages pupils to think about the underlying principles of learning, deepening and consolidating their knowledge (Pashler et al., 2007). These questions are more effective when pupils have grasped key ideas first (Coe et al., 2014).

Open ended questions can also help to extend pupil thinking. Pupils might be asked to make predictions about a book’s story from its title or to reason about a story, for example ‘why did Winnie-the-Pooh get stuck in the rabbit hole?’ (EEF, 2018).

### Ensuring quality answers

To ensure quality answers, questioning should allow enough ‘thinking time’. Research suggests that after asking a question many teachers wait less than one second and, if no answer is given, ask another question or answer the question themselves (Black et al., 2004). Pupils with lower working memory capacities are likely to struggle the most with limited time and preparation (Gathercole et al., 2006), making it more likely class contributions are from higher achievers. A longer wait and time to prepare an answer can lead to more detailed answers and higher-quality thinking from every pupil.

Mr Ashwin could also use questioning to encourage pupils to share answers with their peers, supporting them to articulate key ideas and extend their vocabulary. Effective teachers spend more time on questioning pupils and guiding practice in this way than their less effective peers (Rosenshine, 2012). Teachers who facilitate such talk increase pupil outcomes (Jay et al., 2017). For talk to be effective, Mr Ashwin needs to bear in mind:

- **Pupils need enough knowledge for high-quality talk:** Questioning can offer pupils opportunities to practise new ideas, which can be particularly useful after teacher input and before independent practice, in the ‘We do’ section.
- **Questions can increase the quality of pupil talk:** When conducting questioning, clear teacher expectations and scaffolding are important to support high-quality talk. Teachers can use questions to consolidate technical vocabulary, clarify how to structure answers and to encourage pupils to address other pupils’ misconceptions. (Jay et al., 2017).
- **The learning environment needs to be safe and secure:** Pupil behaviour and outcomes are affected by teacher expectations and what they see other pupils doing (IES, 2008). Mr Ashwin needs to ensure behavioural expectations are enforced to ensure pupils feel safe to contribute answers when called upon through questioning. He needs to insist on mutual trust and respect and be clear that his purpose of questioning is pupil learning, rather than, for example, to catch pupils out.

### Nuances and caveats

Great questioning is often delivered on the spot by experienced teachers and is the product of deep knowledge of their subject and their pupils. This knowledge takes time to acquire so, to be as effective, newer teachers can plan out some of their key questions in advance.

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
There are definitely times we want our pupils to talk in lessons. Meaningful classroom
talk helps pupils to rehearse ideas, check their understanding, and develop their
knowledge. To get the best out of this, classroom talk needs to be carefully planned
and delivered. It will take time and practice, but getting classroom talk rights,
can be a rewarding experience for both pupils and teachers.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Effective classroom talk can help pupils to think when teachers plan it carefully
and set it up well. When pupils are engaged in well-structured talk it can help them
to develop their understanding and lots of different ways. It can help pupils to
retrieve previously learned material, connect new content to existing knowledge and
extend their vocabulary. Classroom talk can support learning when it's planned with
care.

A good starting point for planning classroom talk is to ask yourself what do I want my pupils to think hard about? If you're clear about the purpose of classroom talk when you plan it, it's more likely to be effective. Do you want pupils to recall some existing knowledge? Like what capacity and volume mean? In this case, you might ask pupils to test each other. Or do you want pupils to connect new content to existing knowledge? An example here might be asking pupils to look at where rainforest is on a map and share their predictions about its climate, drawing on their knowledge about the equator. Or do you want pupil to reveal their thinking steps so they can practice getting them right? And this case you might get one pupil to explain what they're doing to another.

Once you've designed a classroom talk activity try testing it out quickly to see whether it requires pupils to think about what you want them to or not. Effective classroom talk should be matched to what pupils need to learn. There are a couple of other key questions that teachers can address at the planning stage:

<ol>
  <li>
    Do my pupils have the necessary knowledge with which to engage in this
    activity?
  </li>
  <li>Do they require any further support?</li>
</ol>
In order to increase the rigor and focus of classroom talk, pupil's need to have
something to talk about. They need to have some knowledge to draw on. They may also
need some scaffolds to guide their talk and keep it on task. Talking frames and vocabulary
banks can be a good way of improving the quality of classroom talk.

Once teachers have plan the classroom talk they need to set it up too. Teachers need to provide clear task instructions which include how they want pupils to behave. This might mean asking pupil to turn and face each other, identifying which person talks fast and who will be responsible for feeding back to the class. Establishing good routines for classroom talk helps pupils to pay attention.

One important thing to bear in mind about classroom talk activities is that it can be difficult to get an accurate picture of what every pupil in the class is thinking. When teachers circulate and listen to pupils talk, they need to think carefully about what they hear before they make any decisions that are based on it. It might be totally obvious that the whole class has misunderstood the task. In which case it'll be well worth stopping it and clarifying. But if you hear one or two pupils make a mistake , that won't show you whether the whole class has made the same error or not. Instead, you want to choose a method of questioning that gives you a much bigger sample size before you decide on what to do next.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will watch an Ambition Institute coach model how to set
up a group talk activity. As you watch pay particular attention to how they do the
following:
<ul>
  <li>Plans activities around what pupils need to think hard about</li>
  <li>
    Provides scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of
    dialogue
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I'm going to model how we can support effective group talk. I
want you to imagine, I'm teaching a year six science lesson. They'd been
learning how to identify and name the parts of the human circulatory system and
know how blood is pumped around the body. I've designed this activity to give
pupils the chance to recall different parts of the circulatory system and think
about how they work. By circulating during the activity, monitoring pupils talk
and using cold call at the end of the activity, it will allow me to gather data
on the depth of pupils' understanding and identify any remaining misconceptions
pupils may have which I can then address. Pupils have worked in groups and pairs
before, but it is still important for me to remind them of the expectations when
working in a group.

<em>
  “So we're going to have five minutes in total for this discussion. I'd like
  you to consider which of the following statements is true and why?{" "}
</em>

<em>A. If you stand on your head your feet won’t get any blood</em>

<em>B. If you stand on your head more blood will go to your head</em>

<em>C. If you stand on your head your heart will need to pump harder</em>

<em>
  D. If you stand on your head, it won’t make any difference to your heart or
  your blood circulation{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I'm going to leave these statements up on the board, throughout your
  discussion. There are also some words I'd expect to hear as I'm listening to
  your discussion. And these are on the board as well. So we have heart,
  circulate, blood vessels, transport, oxygen, gravity, and pressure.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I'm going to model what I would like to see during your discussion using a
  slightly different statement. So the statement I'm considering is, if you
  raise your hand, your heart will need to pump harder. So Rubia, in the
  discussion might say, “I agree with that statement” and she would give her
  reasons why. And Bethany might then say, well, “I disagree with that
  statement” and she would give her reasons why. And they would continue to
  discuss and come to an agreement on that statement.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  I'd like us to remember our classroom rules for discussion as we go through
  this activity. Number one: all members of the group must contribute. Number
  two: every contribution is treated with respect. It's listened to without
  interruption, and it's allowed to finish. Number three: each group will come
  to an agreement about the statements. And that might mean that you need to
  resolve some differences. And number four: every suggestion a member makes
  must be justified. So say what you think and why.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Some of you will make mistakes and that's normal. The purpose of this is to
  help me check what you know. So if you've forgotten something or you make an
  error, we can correct it. If your partner say something you think is wrong,
  you need to firstly listen and politely state what you think is wrong. You
  might say, “I disagree with that, and I think that's wrong because”, and I
  think the right way is. And then you would politely state your point.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  To begin with, I'm going to give you one minute independent thinking time. And
  then we will have four minutes on the main discussion. I'll be circulating the
  room and your one minute thinking time starts now.”
</em>

I want to draw your attention to a few things in that model.  First, I planned the activity around what I want pupils to think hard about. The different features of the circulatory system and how they function. Pupils learnt this content earlier in the lesson, and this is a good opportunity to consolidate their understanding. The task is designed to match the thinking that I want to encourage. By asking pupils to come to an agreement, they are forced to justify their answers and draw upon existing knowledge and connect it to this concrete example.

I put appropriate scaffolds in place to improve the focus and the rigor of the dialogue. Pupils were given time to think on their own before they start talking. And I provided them with a vocabulary bank to improve the accuracy of that talk. I also modelled how they might engage in this discussion to demonstrate that they need to use the words from the vocabulary bank to explain their response.

The task instructions were specific and sequential, and I gave clear behavioural expectations. Pupils should be treated with respect by allowing each person to finish their thought without interruption. All of this guidance helps to ensure that this talk activity will support pupils to think hard and learn.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>

## Teaching challenge

Ms Crosby is increasingly pleased that her questioning is prompting classroom talk but she is unsure how best to structure it to ensure it is having the intended effect. How can she keep pupils talking ‘on-task’ and what groups are best for pupils to learn in? How can Ms Crosby best support talk and thinking that underpins pupil learning?

## Key idea

Teachers can promote pupil learning by giving clear expectations and setting up routines for high-quality classroom talk in pairs and groups.

## Evidence summary

### Classroom talk supports pupil learning

When pupils have enough knowledge, high-quality talk can support them to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend vocabulary. Where pupils discuss concepts with peers, talk reduces individual cognitive load by distributing information across the group, making it more likely pupils will gain new insights into the discussed material (Kirschner et al., 2018).

Through talk, pupils refine their understanding of concepts they are learning about (Jay et al., 2017). It can also provide the opportunity for pupils to rehearse ideas and new vocabulary orally before committing them to paper. However, talk can only succeed where pupils have sufficient knowledge, skills and capabilities linked to a topic or problem, and where clear routines have been established. Talk tasks should not be introduced too early in an instructional sequence.

### Facilitating high quality classroom talk

Opportunities to introduce classroom talk might include:

- When checking pupil understanding, first giving pupils the chance to talk (for example pair talk) before taking a variety of pupil responses.
- Posing challenging questions which might require pupils to explain something to the teacher or to their partners, deepening their understanding of the material discussed.
- Guided discussions, for example during the ‘We Do’ part of the lesson, with teacher prompts guiding pupils’ discussions so they elaborate on one another’s ideas (Mercer & Dawes, in EEF, 2017).

High-quality talk is underpinned by clear behavioural expectations. By reinforcing and practising these, Ms Crosby can build positive habits for how pupils engage with one another, reducing the risk of inappropriate behaviour (IES, 2008). In addition to clear behavioural expectations, Ms Crosby should ensure talk is:

- **Collective:** Teacher and all pupils are involved in the dialogue.
- **Reciprocal:** Participants listen carefully to each other.
- **Supportive:** Contributions are valued and respected.
- **Cumulative:** Talk builds on others’ contributions towards answering an open-ended question.
- **Purposeful:** Building towards a meaningful learning goal (Alexander, 2018).

When pupils know the rules of engagement for classroom talk, for example how long they are to talk for and what each person should be doing, they are freed up to think about the material they are learning rather than behaviour.

### Whole class, paired and group discussion

Ms Crosby may wish to start with whole class discussion so she can support pupils and embed her expectations. As a culture of effective talk develops, Ms Crosby may feel confident about setting up first pairs and then groups for pupils to discuss content together for increasing periods of time. Groupings can affect pupil behaviour and motivation (Tereshenko et al., 2018). Therefore, Ms Crosby should pre-plan groupings, but ensure that they are flexible, and monitor groups’ impacts on pupil learning and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.

Some rules for pair and group work that Ms Crosby might consider introducing are:

- **All group members must contribute:** This helps to avoid some pupils relying on others to complete group tasks. Team members should encourage those who are saying less (with the caveat being that teachers should monitor groups, as pupils who are not speaking may be doing so because they lack the foundational knowledge needed to contribute and therefore require further explicit teaching).
- **Every contribution should be treated with respect:** Partners should listen thoughtfully and allow the speaker to finish.
- **Each group must achieve consensus by the end of the activity:** Teachers may need to resolve differences.
- **Every suggestion a member makes should be justified:** Pupils should say both what they think and why they think it (Mercer et al., 2004, in EEF, 2018).

As with all expectations, Ms Crosby should circulate to monitor and reinforce these rules (IES, 2008). Crucially, the success of classroom talk is reliant on ensuring several things: that pupils have enough knowledge to engage meaningfully in discussions, that they have the guidance and support to undertake meaningful talk tasks and opportunities to practise.

### Nuances and caveats

Pair and group work needs to be explicitly taught, scaffolded and practised like all effective learning (Rosenshine, 2012). Attempting to help pupils discover new ideas for themselves through talk without adequate support is likely to be ineffective (Coe et al., 2014).

<h3>Presenter intro: Helena Moore</h3>
We all want our pupils to improve, and high-quality, specific feedback shows pupils
how to get better. There are many ways in which teachers can give effective feedback,
and they don't have to take up a huge amount of time. Verbal feedback and lessons
can be effective, but when it's planned and delivered well, pupils will know how
to act from the feedback you give them. Good feedback helps pupils to move from where
they are now, to where you want them to be.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Feedback is about sharing information with pupils to change either their effort or
the goals of their work. This can be specific to the task, the areas of learning
or to do with pupils self-regulation. Effective feedback shows pupils what success
looks like in a task or problem, where they are in relation to that success, and
what practical steps they can take to close that gap. Feedback of this type can help
pupils to monitor and evaluate their own learning. For example, in a numeracy class,
reminding pupils is that they can use their fingers to add up two numbers, provides
them with a specific strategy that they can use and check for when they do the task
again. Or when competing an addition sentence, showing them an example that accurately
uses the equals sign, and an example that misses this out can help them to come up
with a better judgment about their own work and identify a specific way to improve.
Pupils can then apply this feedback when they try the task again. Over time, feedback
that shows pupils where they are going, how they are doing, and what they need to
do next, can help them to self-regulate their learning.

There are a number of key ideas that teachers need to bear in mind when planning and implementing feedback. The first is to do with ensuring that pupils can act upon your feedback, it's important to make feedback manageable. Whilst there may be lots of different things your pupils need to do to improve, they can only focus on a few things at a time. Identify one or two specific actions for pupils to do, model how to make those improvements, and make sure that you provide them time to act on the feedback. Feedback that is concrete and clear can be particularly helpful. For example, telling pupils to, <em>"Offer a more thoughtful analysis of Macbeth's character by discussing his doubts as well as his determination",</em> will be better than telling pupils to, <em>"Expand on your points with more thorough analysis of Macbeth's character."</em>

Equally giving direct feedback that gets to the point quickly works well. Try reducing the amount of words that you use so that you focus pupils’ attention on what matters most. In PE for example, pupils will have a better understanding of what to improve if you say, <em>"Try again, this time put all your weight on your left foot"</em>, instead of, <em>"I want you to have another go at that, and this time when you're coming to your run-up, remember to place all your weight on your left foot." </em>

And remember to give pupils enough time to use feedback to improve their work. In order for feedback to work, pupils need to understand it and be able to act upon it.

Another consideration is how to make feedback appealing to pupils. Some pupils respond better than others to feedback. The reasons for this are often to do with complex social factors, and teachers need to be sensitive to this. When giving feedback, show pupils improving work is a normal and continual part of learning by reminding them that the purpose of giving feedback is to help them to get better. Use a neutral tone so that the feedback doesn't feel personal or judgemental.

So far, we've talked about how teachers can support pupils to get the best out of feedback, but it's important to ensure that feedback is manageable for teachers too. Many teachers spend a lot of time writing detailed, written comments on pupil work, and this isn't always the best approach. Try using verbal feedback during lessons, in place of written feedback after lessons, where possible.

Another way to make the best use of your time, is to prioritize feedback that will benefit the majority of the class. That means checking if pupils hold common misconceptions, as well as identifying trends in pupil work. Good feedback can have a significant impact on pupil learning, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to respond to every single thing that your pupils have done in a lesson. Giving effective feedback involves focusing on the things that pupils can do to make the most impact on their learning.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see an Ambition Institute Coach model a way of giving
verbal feedback to the whole class. As you watch, pay attention to how they do the
following:
<ul>
  <li>Focuses on common misconceptions</li>
  <li>
    Provides specific actions for pupils, and enough time for pupils to respond
    to feedback
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
In this example, I'm going to model how we can give whole class feedback to
address misconceptions and provide specific actions for pupils to improve. Now,
this is a year nine RE class, who have been studying Christian beliefs. They've
been practicing writing paragraphs that follow a point, evidence and explain
format. And in their most recent assessments, pupils were asked to explain what
Christians believe about salvation. And I noticed that lots of the pupils
demonstrated a common misconception, that the Bible was written by Jesus. In
this model, I'm going to zoom in on the moment where I am identifying this
misconception, and I'm using a model answer to show them what good looks like.

<em>
  “So, what we've got on the board here is a good example of how to quote from
  the Bible. I'll read it out for you. So we see in the Bible, in the book of
  John, where it says, "For God loved the world so that he gave his one and only
  son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life."{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now, what I've seen in some of your responses when you've been quoting the
  Bible, is that you've used the phrase, Jesus says. And unfortunately, this is
  incorrect, because the Bible was written by lots of different people, inspired
  by the Holy Spirit. And although the New Testament does focus on Jesus' life
  and teachings, it was actually written after his death, by people who were not
  around during his life. And it's actually more accurate to use one of the
  following: in the Bible, it says, the Bible teaches that, or according to the
  Bible. And then you can also refer to the book where that reference is found.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now, look back at your own work and make sure that you've cited the Bible
  correctly. I'm going to give you three minutes to do that, and I'll leave the
  phrases on the board to help you.”
</em>

So let's focus on a couple of features within this model. First, I prioritized giving feedback about a common misconception that many pupils have with regards to Christianity, that Jesus wrote the Bible or that Jesus, at least, wrote the New Testament. And this is something that pupil often get wrong. Now understanding who wrote the Bible and when it was written, is crucial to understanding the beliefs and practices of Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, and is a concept that pupils need to master. And therefore it's an important misconception to address.

Second, I gave pupils a specific action to improve their work. They had to identify how they had cited evidence from the Bible, and make sure that they had done so correctly. Pupils then had time to act on feedback in the lesson, with sentence starters to help them to be accurate. You'll notice how my feedback was brief and to the point, and I delivered it in a neutral tone. I want pupils to act on my feedback quickly, and recognize that this is something that all learners need to do to improve.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we've considered how feedback can support pupil learning, and some
of the ways in which teachers can deliver feedback effectively. Before we finish,
take a moment to reflect on the key ideas of the video. Which of the following ideas
do you think the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced
    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts
  </li>
  <li>
    Focusing on specific actions for pupils and providing time for pupils to
    respond to feedback
  </li>
  <li>
    Using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after
    lessons where possible
  </li>
  <li>
    Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when
    using peer- or self-assessment
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Feedback is one of the most important tools that we have as a teacher. It can
have a profound and positive impact on our pupils. Proper implementation can
give pupils the support they need and encourage them to ultimately monitor their
own learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Ms Kearney is confident when leading the class in instructional sequences that support pupils to make sense of new material. However, pupils sometimes still need input to clarify misunderstandings and correct mistakes. How can Ms Kearney efficiently provide feedback through her instruction to support pupil learning?

## Key idea

Feedback helps pupils to improve and to manage their own learning. Effective feedback should be deployed after considering its benefits and costs and allow pupils the opportunity to respond.

## Evidence summary

### Accurate and helpful feedback

Used effectively, feedback can have a significant impact on pupil learning (EEF, 2018). However, it requires care and attention to ensure feedback is helpful. Done badly, teacher feedback can actually inhibit learning (Kluger & De Nisi, 1996).

There are many types of feedback, all of which have strengths and weaknesses. A key feature of effective feedback is that its _content_ helps a pupil to answer at least one of three questions:

- **Where am I going?** What does success look like in this problem or area?
- **How am I doing?** Relative to success, where am I?
- **Where to next?** What practical steps can I take to close the gap? (Hattie & Timperley, 2007).

While teachers often choose to give written feedback, we have little evidence that this is effective for long term pupil outcomes. It is also highly time consuming (EEF, 2016). Therefore, Ms Kearney should first use the questions above to ensure the content of feedback is useful. She can then decide the most time efficient method to deliver this feedback – written or verbal – rather than assuming written marking is best.

Self and peer feedback linked to these questions is far more time efficient than written teacher marking. However, it is difficult for novices to assess quality or give feedback on complex tasks (Christodoulou, 2017). Therefore, Ms Kearney might consider encouraging pupils to feed-back on more straightforward tasks and to scaffold this with a checklist to support those who need it.

Whole-class feedback involves teachers reviewing all pupils’ work and identifying common misconceptions and errors, before feeding back to the whole class. It is not necessarily tailored to individual needs. However, addressing misconceptions is important for pupil learning and is significantly quicker than written marking (Quigley, 2018).

Ms Kearney must be careful not overwhelm pupils with too much negative feedback; if pupils do not believe they can be successful they may avoid the task completely (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996).

### Feedback supports pupils to manage their own learning

Over time, effective feedback helps pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning (EEF, 2017). Feedback allows pupils to monitor their current performance and understanding. If pupils have a good grasp of their current performance and a clear sense of their goal, then they should increasingly be able to judge how well they are doing and to regulate their learning by identifying what they need to do to improve.

However, pupils can become dependent on feedback when it is given too frequently (Soderstrom & Bjork, in Hendrick & Macpherson, 2018). Additionally, where pupils are frequently given grades as part of their feedback, they can become preoccupied with ‘how I am doing?’ over ‘where to next?’ (EEF, 2016). Finally, pupils will only act on feedback if they believe they can be successful (Kluger & De Nisi, 1996). Ms Kearney must not only provide accurate feedback but also create time in her lessons to ensure her pupils are able to act on it.

### Deciding whether to give feedback

Feedback is part of effective assessment practice (Christodoulou, 2017). However, doing it properly can be time consuming so Mr Kearney must factor this into her decision about when and whether to give feedback.

If Ms Kearney decides she will give feedback, she needs to be clear what format it will take. For example, if she wants to provide individualised written feedback on extended writing, it will require a lot of her time. She might choose this approach if the feedback is very important but she should also plan significant time for pupils to respond. Dedicated feedback lessons can only be afforded sparingly as there is a curriculum to teach, so these may need to be identified in advance as good assessment practice always has a clear idea about the decision it will be used to support before assessment occurs.

A more efficient approach might be to assess pupil misconceptions through a short exit task. If designed well, analysing the proportion of correct responses could be much quicker and Ms Kearney can then decide to either feed-back by reteaching the content, or just move on. Ms Kearney could alternatively feed-back to individuals or small groups of pupils who answered incorrectly at an opportune moment during the next lesson.

Considering options for feedback before assessing pupils is effective practice (Wiliam & Leahy, 2015). Ms Kearney should ask herself the following questions in order to make good decisions about how and when to offer pupils feedback:

- Before I set a task, what will my teaching options be? Is feedback appropriate?
- If feedback is appropriate, what approaches are there?
- Of these approaches, bearing in mind my limited time, which is the most efficient for pupil learning?

### Nuances and caveats

Feedback and marking are often conflated. Marking is only one type of feedback and has significant downsides in terms of teacher time and the ability of pupils to act on it (EEF, 2016). Marking should be thought of as only one of a number of teacher feedback strategies, each with particular pros and cons.

Data from feedback only needs to be recorded when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes. It is usually more beneficial to ensure pupils have received accurate and helpful feedback that they then act upon.

<h3>Presenter: Chloe Wardle</h3>
Welcome to the subject strand. This strand is a combination of two areas, curriculum
and assessment, because curriculum and assessment go hand in hand. The better that
teachers know what they're teaching, the best order they should teach it in, and
the ways of strengthening what pupils know, the more they will be able to support
their pupils to develop their capabilities and understanding. This is what it means
to understand your curriculum.

But teachers also need to find ways of regularly checking how learning is going and ensure that they adapt their teaching in response. This is the role of assessment. Across this strand you will develop your responses to a number of key questions. What am I teaching? How can I make that learning secure? How will I know if my pupils are getting it? And what will I do if they're not?

<h3>Presenter: Harry Fletcher-Wood</h3>
Curriculum involves learning about your subject in depth, its core ideas and how
they're organized. Through access to a broad and balanced curriculum, pupils are
able to develop the knowledge, skills, and values that will enable them to succeed
in school and beyond. Understanding curriculum means understanding what you're teaching
and the best order to teach it in. This allows you to share this learning journey
with your pupils. Thinking about the curriculum that you're delivering is a rewarding
process, especially when you work with experienced subject specialists within your
school.

Assessment is all about checking what your pupils have understood and adapting your teaching based on what you find out. It's one of the most fascinating areas that teachers can explore. You've designed this great lesson, you've taught it really well, but what happened? Did they get it? Do you need to go back and reteach anything? Effective assessment is about revealing pupil thinking so that you can check how learning is going.

<h3>Presenter: Chloe Wardle</h3>
In the first half of this strand, you will learn how to identify what you are teaching,
where pupils may go wrong, and how to deepen pupil understanding. In the second half
of the strand, you will learn about the best ways of assessing what pupils have learned
and how to adapt your teaching in response.

Alongside a written evidence summary, there will be a video to watch each week. This will give you an overview of the content to provide a framework for your thinking. It will also provide you with a concrete model of how you might transfer some of the ideas into practice. You may choose to test out the model in a coaching session or in your teaching. When you do, remember that you will need to adapt what you see to your own context. Video models may not be subject or phase specific, depending on what you teach, but they will exemplify key ideas that are relevant to all.

## **Read | Strand introduction**

Welcome to the _Subject_ strand of the programme. This strand invites you to consider their planning and assessment through the lens of the subject or phase that you work in. It explores evidence and practice in curriculum and assessment in ways that will be of benefit now but will also be useful as your progress through your career.

By the end of this stand you will have explored:

- The curriculum and what it demands of the individual teacher.
- Your mental model of the subject/phase you teach – breaking down your own understanding – and its implications for your planning.
- How we can know what pupils have understood, the barriers we face in doing so and how we respond to their needs.

In _Instruction_ we asked you to explore some ‘rules of thumb’ of teaching. In _Subject_ we will apply the same rules in more detail and look at how _what_ you are teaching influences _how_ you apply those rules – and when you might need to break them. As a result, this strand covers multiple ideas around curriculum, planning and assessment. In the classroom, these ideas will lead to practices that all blend into each other.

However, to help you develop a clear understanding, this strand begins with modules focussed on curriculum and planning, before shifting to looking at assessment:

- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective subject/phase teaching.
- **Modules 2-6** cover the process of effective planning in your subject/phase.
- **Modules 7-12** cover the process of effective assessment and how this can further enhance subject/phase teaching.

### Making it work

This strand will support you to think deeply about your subject and will support you to zoom in on how the nuances of your subject or phase influence your planning and assessment. As with _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_, we also recognise that there may be aspects of this strand that you have less control over. This might include planning proformas or the frequency of your assessments. To make the most of this strand, we suggest that you use resources and materials aligned with your school curriculum and draw on your mentor and other experienced colleagues to support you in applying and adapting ideas for your classroom. Your growing expertise in your subject will also be of help.

As usual, we intentionally touch on content you’ve learned before. In particular, we will continue to prompt you to retrieve and apply your understanding of how pupils learn because it is so fundamental to effective teaching. Knowing how pupils learn is invaluable but it does not mean a ‘one size fits all’ approach will work across every subject or phase. The knowledge, skills and conceptual understanding in each subject or phase is unique. All subjects have their own way of structuring knowledge and curriculum planning differs by age.

While the Early Career Framework refers to ‘good subject and curriculum knowledge’, we know that some teachers – especially Primary and Early Years teachers – may refer to the content they teach as ‘phase’ or ‘topic’ knowledge, as the curriculum they teach includes multiple subjects. In line with the ECF, this strand uses the title ‘subject’ to encapsulate all of the content teachers might teach and recognises teachers might use other terms in their setting.

Whilst the _Subject_ strand has attempted to explore ideas and practices in ways that will be relevant to all subjects and phases, there will undoubtedly be specific things that just don’t apply. For this strand more than the others, teachers and mentors will need to draw on their own subject and phase expertise to adapt the learning experience where required. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to support. Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter, seeking their assistance, challenge, feedback and critique, will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context. Participating in wider networks can also strengthen your pedagogical and subject knowledge.

### A reminder of the programme pattern

The learning will be structured in the same way as _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_, following a weekly rhythm:

- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.
- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.
- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.
- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.

Year one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF. Now that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary, exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Mohamed is feeling increasingly effective at managing behaviour and adapting lessons planned by others. In doing so, his subject knowledge has been growing. How can he best use his developing knowledge to plan and deliver effective lessons which develop pupils’ mental models?

## Key idea

Understanding curriculum, planning and assessment, as well as the relationships between them, is an important foundation for effective subject teaching which develops pupil mental models.

## Evidence summary

### The power of subject teaching

Mr Mohamed’s teaching can make a big difference to pupils. It can transform both their academic results and life chances: increasing the likelihood that they attend university and have a higher salary and decreasing the chances they have children as teenagers (Chetty et al., 2014; Slater et al., 2011). Lower-achieving pupils appear to benefit most from effective teaching (Slater et al., 2011).

The expectations a teacher sets are likely to influence pupils’ efforts and responses (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). Where effective teaching helps pupils achieve success, pupils are likely to display greater subsequent motivation and thus greater effort (Coe et al., 2014). There is strong evidence that effective teaching is underpinned by teacher’s knowledge of their subject(s) and how to teach it (Coe et al., 2014; Ball et al., 2008). To make a difference to his pupils Mr Mohamed needs to develop his subject knowledge.

Subject knowledge is organised in mental models in the mind of the learner – a collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which fit together to provide an overall understanding of an idea (Sweller et al., 1998). Mr Mohamed needs to both develop _his_ mental model of his subject and consider how to best organise and use this information to develop his pupils’ mental models. For example, he can consider that a common misconception in history is that a church is a physical building rather than a group of people and target this misconception to ensure his pupils gain a correct mental model when he teaches this.

### What is curriculum?

A school’s curriculum sets out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that pupils will learn. There are many reasons for educating young people, and these inform which curriculum content is selected (Wiliam, 2013). Selection should also be guided by the National Curriculum. The overall aim should be that material is selected based on a coherent vision for pupils’ success. This is curriculum _intent_: the content selected to be taught and the sequence in which it should be explored, including how content builds in complexity or is revisited (Wiliam, 2013).

The school establishes the curriculum, but every teacher must also think about curriculum because they are the people who are ultimately putting it into practice. Mr Mohamed might not be writing schemes of work but he can bring content to life for his pupils. This is curriculum _implementation_: the instructional approaches, activities and resources specified to teach curricular intent. Implementation is therefore seen in both medium-term planning, individual lesson planning and the ‘lived’ curriculum of the classroom (Wiliam, 2013).

Mr Mohamed aims to use his subject mental model to implement the curriculum in such a way that it develops pupils’ mental models of his subject and pursues the intended curriculum as closely as possible. This incorporates both the knowledge that he hopes pupils will gain, and the ways he hopes they will be able to use this knowledge. In doing so, understanding the school’s vision and the reasoning behind its curricular choices will be useful.

### What is planning?

Planning takes the ideas of the intended curriculum and turns them into learning activities. It must therefore implement the curriculum choices the school has made, drawing on Mr Mohamed’s subject knowledge. One way Mr Mohamed might effectively plan is by following five habits:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Habit 1: Break down your goal** into the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject by analysing your assessment and wider curriculum goals for the unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Habit 2: Build on prior knowledge** by linking what pupils already know to what is being taught and sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Habit 3: Make the learning accessible** by seeking to understand pupils’ difference including potential barriers to learning and common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Habit 4: Build lasting learning** by planning for regular retrieval and spaced practice opportunities to build automatic recall of knowledge and supporting pupils to learn key ideas securely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Habit 5: Increase complexity** by providing opportunities for all pupils to learn and master essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject, ensuring pupils link new ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models through drawing explicit links between the new content and core concepts and principles and slowly withdrawing concrete examples and drawing attention to the underlying structures of the problem. |

Mr Mohamed notices quite a lot of overlap between the habits of planning and content covered in the _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_ strands. There also don’t appear to be clear-cut answers for how to implement these habits in his subject planning. He intends to discuss with his mentor what these might look like for his context, and how he can try these out of the next term.

### What is assessment?

To assess is to draw conclusions from evidence: inferences about what pupils have learned (Wiliam, 2010). Mr Mohamed might ask himself how much his pupils have understood in an activity, at the end of a lesson or at the end of the year. Effective assessment practices allow him to make inferences which truly reflect pupils’ understanding. Effective assessment builds on a well-specified curriculum so Mr Mohamed’s efforts at planning will support his assessment to be more effective and efficient.

Making these inferences can be difficult. Mr Mohamed must be careful that the inference he is making reflects what he really wants to know and that he is not distracted by poor proxies for learning (Coe, 2013). For example, not assuming that just because pupils are busy that they are learning. It also means recognising that pupils may perform better in the short term but then forget what they studied (Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015). To help, he should choose, where possible, externally validated materials – such as standardised test created by external bodies or groups of schools and administered in controlled conditions, perhaps at the end of the year – if he needs to make a summative judgement about how much his pupils have learned over a period of time with greater confidence.

### Assessment and feedback

Effective assessment can also be used much more frequently to allow Mr Mohamed to adapt his teaching and respond to pupils’ needs. This form of assessment is the main focus of the _Subject_ strand. Teachers can regularly collect information on pupil learning in a lesson, for example through questioning a number of pupils to check for understanding after conveying new content. They can use their inferences from this data formatively to adapt their teaching and respond to pupils’ needs where necessary (Christodoulou, 2017). Evidence suggests that among the most powerful ways to respond to pupil needs is to offer feedback. Effective feedback is motivating, guiding pupils on where they have succeeded and what they need to improve (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). It also leads pupils to act to close the gap (Sadler, 1989).

There are many ways to give effective feedback and Mr Mohamed’s choices should reflect what his pupils need and the importance of taking a sustainable approach. For example, he might offer verbal feedback or give abbreviated feedback using a marking code (EEF, 2016). These approaches are quick to do while giving pupils valuable information, encourage pupil effort and improve their learning. Mr Mohamed can work with colleagues to think about how he could ensure his assessment and feedback are efficient. He hopes to use it to support his pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning (EEF, 2017), helping them to become successful independent learners.

### Linking curriculum, planning and assessment

For assessment, planning and curriculum to be effective, they must be coherent. For example, teaching resources should align with assessments – the tests pupils sit should reflect what they have been taught – and both should align with the curriculum (Oates, 2011). Equally, Mr Mohamed should avoid letting summative assessments – like SATs and GCSEs – shape all his planning. Instead he should aim to use the knowledge of his subject to teach and assess a coherent, broad and balanced curriculum.

### Nuances and caveats

No exam can test everything that matters in a subject. Exams ‘sample’ from the subject: they choose a handful of questions to test key ideas. This is an effective and efficient way to assess but if this guides all of a teacher’s planning, they are likely to overlook basic ideas (which are implicit in exam questions), broader ideas (which lay the foundations for future study) and interesting ideas (Christodoulou, 2017). Mr Mohamed must avoid the trap of letting assessment narrow his teaching.

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
Behind every good lesson is a really good plan. The better teachers know what they're
teaching before they step into the classroom, the more effective they can be. But
identifying what to teach can feel daunting. So where should teachers start? A good
approach to planning is to start at the end. Teachers need to identify ambitious
learning goals for their pupils, and understand what they're made up of. Planning
backwards from ambitious learning goals can lead to success in school and beyond.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Teachers need to deliver a rich and carefully sequenced curriculum. In order to deliver
a curriculum well, teachers need a detailed understanding of it. This will include
a solid understanding of what the topic is, the best order in which to teach it and
where pupils are likely to go wrong. Planning backwards is a technique that can help
teachers to develop this knowledge.  In particular, planning backwards helps teachers
to know what they are teaching in depth.

Planning backwards begins with:

<ol>
  <li>Identifying learning goals and</li>
  <li>Unpicking learning goals to see what they are made up of.</li>
</ol>
There are several strategies that teachers can use to identify learning goals. Firstly,
the unit of work that they're teaching will often set out the most important content.
So highlighting learning goals in a unit of work is a good place to start. Most school
curricula are influenced by the national curriculum. Reading the relevant section
of the national curriculum is another way to identify learning goals. Some units
of work will include an end of unit assessment. Whilst this will not assess everything
that the unit of work covers, it should assess a sample of the most important content.
Completing the end of unit task can help teachers to identify learning goals because
it gives them a concrete example of what success may look like at the end of the
unit. Finally, teachers can draw on their own subject knowledge to identify learning
goals for pupils. They can ask themselves, what do I know about this content? Or,
what does a good example of this content look like?

The next key step in playing backwards is to unpick what the learning goals consist of. Learning goals needs to be broken down into specific content to make them more manageable for pupils. To do this, answering these two questions can help. What knowledge sits within this goal? What skills are required to achieve this goal? Unpicking learning goals gives teachers the detailed understanding that they need to teach. It's best to do this thinking with someone else. It takes time to identify learning goals and unpick what they consist of. Also, things that appear easy to do, can often be tricky to teach. A teacher may be brilliant at writing a persuasive essay but being able to identify what makes it so good, at least not yet. We all know how to tell the time from an analogue clock but working out what knowledge this draws on and why pupils often go wrong is really hard. Instead of doing this on your own, work with someone who knows the subject, and knows how to teach it.

Once teachers have identified learning goals and unpicked them, they can use this knowledge to make decisions about what content to prioritize, the best order in which to teach it and the best way to share it. Teachers need to break learning goals down so that they can piece this content back together in a way that will make sense for their pupils.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you're going to watch part of a coaching session with an early
career teacher. The aim of the coaching session is to identify the learning goals
of the following year three topic. Rain forests. As you watch pay particular attention
to how the coach and the teacher do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Identify the essential concepts, knowledge and skills</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>
<em>
  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So by the end of this unit on rain forests, what do
  we want our pupils to know and be able to do?
</em>

<em>
  ECT (PAULA DELANEY): Here is the list of knowledge that identified from
  looking at the scheme of work.
</em>

<em>KNOWLEDGE</em>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>To know what rainforests are</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To know what an ecosystem is</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know what the equator is and that it is warmer because it is closer to
      the sun{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To know that a continent is a mass of land </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that South America is a continent and that it is surrounded by the
      Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To know what deforestation is and what impact it has</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<em>
  COACH: Great, this is all important content specifically mentioned in the
  scheme of work. Let's see if we can break it down further. So it'd be good to
  do this with some of the items on your list of knowledge. So we can be more
  specific. If you're more specific in your thinking now, you'll save a lot of
  time later when you use this content in your lessons. For example, instead of
  to know what rain forests are, it would be better to say to know that rain
  forests are ecosystems filled with mostly evergreen trees, and typically
  receive high amounts of rainfall. And then go further and say that rain
  forests are made up of a canopy layer, the understory and the forest floor.
  You need to change those 'know what' statements to 'know that' statements. So
  as part of my planning for the unit, I did some of this thinking, by
  completing the end of unit assessment and coming up with a list of knowledge
  and skills, which I think it'd be really helpful for you to see. Let's have a
  look:
</em>

<em>KNOWLEDGE</em>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that a continent is an area of the world that contains different
      countries.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that there are seven different continents: Africa, Antartica,
      Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know  that rainforests lie between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic
      of Capricorn (invisible lines).
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that rainforest are found near the equator with high average
      temperatures and humidity{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that around two thirds of the world’s species live in rainforests.
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that rainforests are home to thousands of different animal
      species.
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that birds mainly live in the emergent layer of rainforests.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To know that larger mammals live on the forest floor. </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that some arboreal mammals live in trees, like monkeys and sloths.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that deforestation is when a wide area of trees cleared for
      non-forest use.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that it is estimated that an area of rainforest the size of a
      football pitch is cut down every single second.{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that rainforests play an important role in absorbing carbon
      dioxide and producing oxygen
    </em>
  </li>
</ul>
<em>SKILLS</em>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>To be able to use compass points to locate a place on a map</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<em>
  COACH: Are any of these statements ones we think pupils will already have?
  Let's put a star next to the ones where we think people's will have relevant
  prior knowledge.
</em>

<em>
  ECT: So to know that a continent is an area of the world that contains
  different countries, to know that there are seven different continents, and to
  be able to use compass points to locate a place in the map.
</em>

<em>COACH: How do we know that pupils will know what a continent is?</em>

<em>
   ECT: Well, I know what pupils were told what a continent is in year two in
  the topic our amazing world, and I've looked at some of my class assessments
  from this topic, and majority include the correct definition of continent.
  I'll also make sure that I recall this knowledge at the start of the unit, and
  at key points throughout to make sure that it's really secure.
</em>

<em>
   COACH: Great. Let's think now about the key misconceptions. So where do you
  think pupils might typically go wrong?
</em>

<em>
   ECT: I think that they might get confused about why it rains in a hot place.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: Yes, that's definitely a misconception. They associate heat with the
  sun not the rain. We'll need to correct it because it will get in the way of
  them understanding about rain forests, and the process of precipitation, which
  they learn next year when they study the water cycle. Another misconception
  that pupils hold is thinking that trees in the rain forest are a similar
  height to tall trees that they have come across, like an oak tree. They find
  it really hard to understand the difference in scale, but again, this needs
  correcting. If it isn't they'll find it hard to understand why such a large
  range of animals can live in the rainforests together. They wonder why jaguars
  roam around the forest floor and don't eat monkeys who live in the canopy.
  They won't understand that they're such a huge distance apart. We've done some
  really detailed thinking here. You'll be able to use this when you're
  preparing individual lessons and when you're delivering the lessons
  themselves. The next step is to think about how we sequence this content, what
  pupils will need to know at the beginning so that they can build on it
  throughout the unit.
</em>
<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
In this example, the coach and the early career teacher focused primarily on
identifying the essential concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils need to
learn about rain forests. They drew on a range of sources to identify this
content. The school's units of work, a completed end of unit task and their own
subject knowledge. They broke big statements into detail. Changing big 'know
what' statements into smaller 'know that' statements. And then they considered
their list from the pupils point of view, asking themselves which of the content
pupils already knew, and what common misconceptions they would be likely to
hold.

They didn't think about the best order to teach it in yet. Just like identifying the learning content of the lesson in detail before you plot out the activities, it is really important to identify the learning content of a unit of work, before you decide the order in which to teach it. That comes next.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored why it is important to plan backwards from end goals
and given some practical strategies that you can use during your own planning. Before
we finish, take a moment to read over the key ideas. Which of these ideas do you
think that the example illustrates the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify possible misconceptions and plan how to prevent these forming
  </li>
  <li>Be aware of common misconceptions</li>
  <li>
    Discuss with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important
    concepts
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Getting to know your curriculum and what you want pupils to learn takes time,
and it's an ongoing process. But this is an essential part of what teachers do.
The better that teachers understand the learning goals of their unit, the more
likely they will be to ensure that pupils achieve them. $EndContent

## Teaching challenge

Ms Andrews is increasingly confident in managing behaviour and motivating students to participate in lessons. This gives her more time to think about lessons. She wants to ensure she is making the best use of the limited time she has with pupils: how can her planning best ensure pupils learn?

## Key idea

Effective teaching is planned backwards, breaking down and communicating ambitious learning goals set out in the curriculum.

## Evidence summary

### **Basing learning on the curriculum**

Ms Andrews’ planning begins with the curriculum. The curriculum sets out the learning to which all pupils are entitled (Wiliam, 2016). It determines the ideas pupils should encounter and the knowledge and skills they should acquire (Wiliam, 2018). This guides teachers to teach the most important knowledge, skills and values effectively. For example, a carefully designed maths curriculum (alongside effective teaching methods) appears to increase pupil learning (Jerrim & Vignoles, 2016).

Most schools base their curriculum on the national curriculum, with adaptations to suit pupils’ needs and the school’s vision. Individual teachers are not responsible for setting the curriculum: what they do, which no curriculum designer can do, is make the curriculum comprehensible. They do this by connecting what pupils are to learn with their existing knowledge and experience (Young et al, 2014). Ms Andrews’ success relies on secure knowledge of the curriculum and her pupils in order to motivate and teach them effectively.

### What teachers need to know about what they teach

A challenge intrinsic to teaching is making complicated ideas in the curriculum comprehensible to pupils (Kennedy, 2015). In doing this, Ms Andrews must balance making ideas simple enough to understand, whilst remaining meaningful, and true to the curriculum. Ms Andrews’ skill in doing this rests on her developing understanding of the knowledge, skills and values she teaches. As well as being guided by the school curriculum, she can use colleagues and shared resources to build this knowledge. When she does so, to translate curriculum goals into effective learning experiences, Ms Andrews needs to know:

- **The topic:** What a non-specialist, but well-informed adult might know about it.
- **Ways to introduce and sequence ideas:** In what order to introduce key ideas, and how best to explain them.
- **Where pupils will struggle and what they might get wrong:** Allowing her to anticipate and overcome pupils’ misunderstandings.
- **Potential links:** How the current topic connects to past and future topics (Ball, Thames & Phelps, 2008).

Ms Andrews needs more than a knowledge of the topic: she needs to know how students learn it and how to make it comprehensible to them.

### Breaking learning down

This knowledge — of curricular goals and how pupils learn them – allows Ms Andrews to plan lessons which work towards her goals in logical, carefully-pitched steps. Ms Andrews is aware of the need to break complicated ideas down to make them comprehensible: she designs tasks so that they do not provide too much new or complicated information at once.

However, she recognises a broader point about breaking learning down when she plans lessons which work towards learning goals. Rather than designing isolated tasks and fitting them into a lesson, she seeks to link tasks to form a sequence of meaningful steps towards learning goals across multiple lessons. To succeed she needs to make explicit links to what has been previously studied and learned as she goes. For example, when she introduces a new idea with concrete examples and highlights the underlying principles and offers practice, each activity is a step towards achieving the learning goal, building on previous study.

This approach allows her to organise her lessons around a narrative structure of steps towards understanding and achieving a learning goal: this approach is both more comprehensible and more memorable for pupils (Willingham, 2009, pp.66-9).

### Nuances and caveats

While schools establish what they will teach informed by the National Curriculum, teachers are always doing curricular thinking, as they find new and better ways to teach the school’s curriculum. Their thinking then informs future revisions of the curriculum. Gaining this knowledge of how pupils learn a subject takes time. A new teacher would not be expected to achieve this depth immediately: the usefulness of these categories is in knowing what to think about in planning, and what to ask colleagues. High-quality curricular resources may also embody these forms of knowledge, for example textbooks or colleagues’ shared resources aligned to the school curriculum.

$Content

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
Everything that we decided to include in a lesson should help pupils to achieve clear
learning goals. But it can often feel like there is a large amount of content to
cover. Teachers need to identify the different types of knowledge that a lesson includes,
and know why they are there. How do different bits help to develop pupil understanding?
Identifying different types of knowledge helps teachers to understand the best routes
through the content and what areas they might prioritise.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
When you look at a lesson, there is often a daunting amount of content to teach.
It would be overwhelming to present pupils with a mass of content, but we can't simply
cut out all the detail either. Instead teachers need to create a meaningful pathway
that guides pupils towards clear learning goals. Put another way. We want to help
pupils to construct coherent mental models from the content that we teach them.

A mental model is what we know about something. It is a structured body of knowledge and skills that helps us to make sense of things. We use mental models to understand and navigate the world around us. When we enter a restaurant, our mental model of what a restaurant is and what people do within a restaurant guides our actions. Our mental model of a restaurant is likely to include the fact that there will be menus to choose from. So we might look for a menu when we sit down. When we read a text that mentions the word dinosaur, we draw on our mental model of what a dinosaur is to make meaning from the words. We know that dinosaurs are extinct and could be ferocious, and this will help us to make sense of the text. The more we know about the world and the better that knowledge is secured and organised, the more we can know and do. We want to help pupils to build mental models and retain them in the long term. Examining your own mental model of the content, what you know about it, will help with this process.

To identify the different types of knowledge within a lesson and the role that they play in forming pupils' mental models, it can be helpful to do a sorting exercise, in which teachers identify the most important content that they want pupils to remember, and the additional content that will be necessary for this. They can identify the critical content and supporting materials such as the best examples, analogies, stories, and details to frame it and make it stick.

Critical content is what you hope your pupils will remember in one year, three years or even more. The concept of solitude, the concept of evaporation. Supporting material enables pupils to access this critical content. But we may be willing to accept pupils forgetting some of it. Individual examples of solitude, that the puddles dried up in the playground before children had a chance to jump in them. Supporting material includes analogies, stories, and illustrations. There are different ways of presenting material and teachers need to think carefully about this choice. Examples give your understanding substance. Critical content will sit at the heart of our pupils mental models, and lots of other content will relate to it. We want our pupils to keep hold of it, and apply it in the future.

Both critical and supporting content are important. Supporting material may provide the concrete examples that make sense of an abstract concept to recall the prior knowledge that will help pupils to understand and remember something new. Supporting material can provide pupils with the rich breadth of knowledge through the broad and balanced curriculum should offer, and increased complexity. For example, when teaching the First and Second World Wars, including the contribution of BAME soldiers, helps to expand pupils understanding of the personal sacrifices made. Supporting materials might also bring the lessons to life and help pupils to pay attention. For example, a geography teacher may want pupils to understand the concept of biome. To do that they might teach pupils about some of the different plants and animals that live in a particular biome, perhaps the Amazon rainforest. Over time pupils are likely to remember the meaning of biome, but forget some of the details specific to the Amazon rainforest. That pupils retain the understanding of biome is important but that doesn't make the details redundant.

When teachers have a good understanding of the critical content and supporting material in a lesson, and how they are connected, they can sequence learning in a coherent way. They can identify prior knowledge that links to the critical material, and ensure that the lesson builds on that. They will know when to introduce supporting material and when to move on from it. And which content they will need to revisit in order to strengthen it. They can take their pupils on a better learning journey.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next model, you will hear part of a coaching conversation. The focus of the
conversation is to identify the different types of knowledge that one particular
lesson covers, and the order in which they should come. As you watch pay particular
attention to how they do the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject
  </li>
  <li>
    Sequence lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before
    encountering more complex content
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>
<em>
  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So our goal for this coaching session is to
  understand what content you're teaching in the lesson, and why that each piece
  of content is there. So we want to know the most critical content and what the
  role of the supporting material is playing in their learning. Remind me what
  the scheme of work is? What the overall learning goal the lesson? And how is
  the lesson is connected to the goal in the scheme of work?
</em>

<em>
   ECT (PAULA DELANEY): So this is a Year 3 scheme of work about the
  rainforests. And the learning goal for this lesson is to understand some of
  the differences between their lives and the lives of tribal families. And so
  far pupils have a good understanding of what a rainforest is and the vast
  amount of species and plants that the rainforest supports. But in this lesson,
  they will be learning more about the people that the rainforest supports.
  Later on pupils will learn what deforestation is. So a key goal of this scheme
  of work is understanding the detrimental effect of deforestation. In this
  lesson, pupils need to acquire an understanding of how vital the rainforest is
  to the people that live there, so they can recognise how bad deforestation is
  for the people that were rely on it.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: Great. I know that you've looked at the suggested lesson resources to
  identify what pupils are learning. Can you show me the list of knowledge and
  skills that you've identified?
</em>

<em> ECT: Yep, here's is the list.</em>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that most children in the UK tend to live with their parents{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that in the Amazon rainforest children live with their extended
      family in tribes{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that children in the UK have free access to healthcare via the NHS
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that tribal families in the Amazon rainforest have limited access
      to healthcare clinics or hospitals but instead rely on local plants and
      remedies{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that many of the medicines we use in the UK come from plants which
      grow in the Amazon rainforest{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that children in the UK must now be in education or training until
      at least the age of 16. In England the age is 18{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that education in the Amazon rainforest can take many different
      forms as communities can be quite small and remote: some pupils may have
      lessons which are delivered remotely while others attend small schools
      where there are pupils of different ages taught by the same teacher{" "}
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that in the UK much of the food we eat is bought from shops and
      supermarkets
    </em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>
      To know that in the Amazon rainforest communities tend to work together to
      grow and produce their own food locally or hunt for it using tools they
      have developed specifically for this purpose
    </em>
  </li>
</ul>
<em>
  COACH: Great. So now I want you to think about which of the content you would
  describe as critical. So by critical, I mean, it's the content that you want
  your pupils to remember in the long term. Perhaps because there's lots of
  other ideas that relate to it, or because it's critical to their understanding
  of other concepts in the scheme of work like deforestation or sustainability.
</em>

<em>
  ECT: Okay. Sure. I think that this is the content that I would describe as
  critical.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: Let's apply a couple of questions to these statements, to test out
  whether they really are critical content. Let's take this statement first. Why
  is it important that pupils know and remember this?
</em>

<em>
  ECT: So food is locally sourced by Amazon rainforest communities from the
  forest and river around them. They have developed a specific tools and
  practices for hunting local game, and children learn about different plants
  that are edible as part of their education. So if our pupils know this it will
  help them to recognise that one of the reasons why deforestation is so
  devastating because it deprives communities in the Amazon rainforest of that
  vital food source.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: Great. Is there any material that you think is supporting? So by
  supporting, I mean did it helps to understand this core content but we might
  not require pupils to remember it in the long term.
</em>

<em>
  ECT: Yeah, remembering the specific types of food that people in the Amazon
  rainforest eat.
</em>

<em>COACH: </em>
<em>Okay. So why is this material in the lesson?</em>

<em>
  ECT: So introducing them to different food types, gives them a concrete
  example, which will help them to see how much communities in the Amazon rely
  on local food production. I wouldn't expect them to remember the precise foods
  consumed in the Amazon, but I do want them to remember it, that they are
  reliant on local foods.
</em>

<em>
  COACH: I agree. And looking back at your original list, I would suggest that
  the following content could also be described as supporting material. It
  serves that important purpose in the lesson, but we're willing to accept that
  pupils may forget some of it. Let's have a look. So knowing what school is
  like for children in the Amazon rainforest will be really interesting to our
  pupils. And it's another example of something concrete that will help them
  relate to children in the Amazon, but it's okay if pupils lose this detail,
  once it's served its purpose in the lesson. In terms of sequencing, which
  items on your list do you think it makes sense to start with first?
</em>

<em>
  ECT: I think it would be good to start by looking at the different food
  sources in the rainforest. This gives pupils an opportunity to recall what
  they know about the different plant and animal species in there. This is
  something we explored in previous lessons. It also helps them to visualize
  what rainforest are like. And they will need to do this before they can think
  about the lives of the people who live in the rainforests.
</em>

<em>COACH: What would pupils need to learn next?</em>
<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
There were a couple of key ideas to highlight from this conversation. First,
both the coach and the early career teacher were clear about what they wanted
their pupils to remember from the lesson. From a longer list of knowledge, they
identified the critical content. Once they had identified what knowledge pupils
needed to learn, they discussed how to sequence it. They identified which
knowledge pupils needed to secure first. In this case, knowledge of the
different plants and animal species found in the Amazon rainforest.

This is only a snapshot of a longer coaching conversation. So it cannot show the full detail of everything discussed. However, even from this short example, it is clear that the early career teacher was thinking deeply about what pupils were learning in the lesson, what purpose each piece of content served and the best order in which to teach it. This will enable the early career teacher to plot a clear path through the large amount of content, ensuring that the pupils secure and revisit the big ideas of a subject over time.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored how to identify different types of knowledge in a
lesson, and how to sequence them. Before we finish, read over the key ideas that
we have covered. Which ones do you feel that the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the
    subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these
    critical components.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before
    encountering more complex content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts
    through a range of examples.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Thinking hard about what you are teaching is a vital part of a teacher's role.
Examining different types of knowledge in a lesson and how it is connected,
helps teachers to know what they're teaching and why. They can then use this
knowledge to make decisions in the classroom that can help motivate pupils in
their learning and develop sophisticated mental models of their subject.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones has reviewed the curriculum for his next topic: he is confident about the learning goals, has refreshed his knowledge of the key ideas and has talked to colleagues about how pupils can best learn them. However, the amount and range of content appears huge. He is unsure how he will find time to cover everything in depth. What should he prioritise teaching?

## Key idea

Teachers can develop pupils’ mental models by identifying and ensuring they understand and retain critical subject content.

## Evidence summary

### Mental models

Mr Jones is using guidance from the school curriculum, colleagues and curricular resources to build up an increasingly sophisticated mental model of the subject. A mental model is a structured body of knowledge. It is a collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which fit together to provide an overall understanding of an idea (Sweller et al., 1998). For example, most adults have a mental model of a restaurant: this means they know what to do (more-or-less) in a new restaurant or an unfamiliar country (Sweller et al., 1998). Similarly, Mr Jones has a mental model of the topics he is teaching: both the content that he is going to teach about and how to teach it in a way that links to a subject – what makes this content historical or mathematical? He knows the key ideas, the underlying principles and how they fit together. For example, he knows the key events of the English Civil War, how they are linked and different ways in which they can be interpreted.

To achieve curricular goals, he must use his subject mental model to motivate pupils to develop increasingly complex mental models of the subject. The more complex a pupil’s mental model, the better they can apply it to skills such as answering questions, solving problems or learning new ideas (Willingham, 2009). For example, a pupil whose mental model did not include the word “monarch”, or the concept of “Parliament” would struggle to make sense of a text describing the causes of the Civil War. In contrast, a pupil with a complex mental model would move from attempting to understand the story of the Civil War to using historical reasoning as to which cause was most significant.

### The importance of knowledge

When pupils learn, they gain – and retain – deeper and more sophisticated knowledge in their mental models. Developing pupil knowledge is important as the more pupils know (and the better organised their knowledge), the better they can understand a new idea (by connecting it to their existing knowledge) and the better they can solve problems (by applying their knowledge). Their existing knowledge reduces the burden on pupils’ working memory (Deans for Impact, 2015; Willingham, 2006).

Therefore, if Mr Jones is to help pupils achieve ambitious learning goals, his priority is teaching pupils knowledge in order to also develop their skills (Willingham 2009). He should focus on what he wants his pupils to know and be able to do. For example, a wide vocabulary will help pupils understand unfamiliar texts, while knowledge of long multiplication gives pupils the capability to solve previously unseen maths problems.

To develop pupils’ mental models, Mr Jones must first identify their constituent parts: exactly what he wants pupils to know. This helps him to reduce his sophisticated knowledge into comprehensible building blocks for pupils: doing so reduces the risk of overestimating pupils’ knowledge and underestimating how hard they will find new ideas (Wiliam, 2013). If he wants pupils to explain the causes of the Civil War, he can identify what he wants them to know about each cause, for example: “to know that King Charles I believed he ruled by Divine Right.” If he wants pupils to complete long multiplication, he can identify that he wants them to know that a number can be partitioned into tens and hundreds.

### Prioritising subject content

Having identified everything he wants pupils to know about a topic, Mr Jones is left with a problem: there is a huge amount of relevant and interesting knowledge. He can address this by identifying the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – the ‘critical’ subject content that pupils need to remember in order to have a complete mental model (Counsell, 2018; Sweller et al., 1998). Critical content is what he hopes pupils will recall in one, three, or perhaps even ten years: Iago’s jealousy, the causes of the English Civil War and how to design an experiment.

Mr Jones could also identify howhe wants his pupils to organise what they remember. For example, concepts are organising ideas that allow us to categorise knowledge (Chi, 2009). Critical concepts, then, are important _subject_ ideas Mr Jones will want to return to many times to help pupils develop _organised_ mental models of his subject. Therefore, he can introduce the idea of the _tragic form_ in English literature and teach Othello as an example of this. In science, he could teach the _scientific method_ in biology, chemistry and physics and use experiments as examples of these. This content also will influence how he sequences what he teaches. He can plan how a new idea can be linked to previous and future learning (Wiliam, 2013) by asking: which content is foundational and why? Where relevant, he might also identify subject principles (Chi, 2009). Subject principles are rules or theorems that serve to apply across a whole field. They can be used to transcend specific examples. For example, in physics he might teach the _Law of Conservation of Energy_ or _Newton’s Second Law (F=MA)_ and highlight when these principles are returned to, to help pupils organise their mental models. In an Early Years setting, teachers might return to the principle of synthetic phonics at different times as they teach reading.

The National Curriculum also calls for a ‘broad and balanced curriculum’. So, in addition to ‘critical’ content, Mr Jones should select ‘supporting’ content: further examples, stories and illustrations that he won’t necessarily expect his pupils to remember, but which will bring his teaching to life and support pupils to remember and understand the critical content. It is particularly effective if these examples explicitly link to pupils’ knowledge and experiences. This supporting content helps pupils make sense of critical content: Othello wouldn’t make sense without all its characters; getting the equipment wrong means an experiment will not work. So, while Mr Jones is teaching these topics, he wants pupils to know, understand and recall supporting content as well as the critical content. However, after teaching the topic, he will accept that he does not need to revisit supporting content (since not every item of information can be recalled and his time is limited); but he will want to ensure critical content is revisited to strengthen it.

### Nuances and caveats

Developing pupils’ knowledge does not just mean teaching isolated facts: mental models are organised collections of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles.

While it is important that supporting content brings critical content to life and makes it meaningful, teachers need to be careful that it does not distract from pupils remembering critical content.

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
As pupil learn something new, they begin to form and modify complex mental models
in their memory. They connect new content to existing knowledge that they hold. Whilst
it would be great to think that they will only add accurate information to their
mental models, the reality is somewhat different. Along the way pupils are likely
to pick up lots of misconceptions. Gaps may also appear in pupils' mental models.
Teachers need to identify the gaps and misconceptions that pupils may hold so that
they can help their pupils to correct them.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Misconceptions are beliefs which conflict with what is to be learned. This differs
from lack of knowledge, where pupils have gaps in their understanding about a topic.
Misconceptions also differ from mistakes. An example of a mistake might be spelling
a word wrong. Do pupil knows how to spell the word correctly but have forgotten in
that moment. It's just an oversight. A misconception on the other hand can often
be deeply rooted.

Misconceptions exist in every subject and phase. In early years, pupils might think that when leaves fall off the trees in autumn, the trees are dying or in science pupils often think that when liquids evaporate they have disappeared. Misconceptions like this can cause a significant barrier to pupils learning so we need to do something about them.

Here's one approach that teachers can take to misconceptions. First, identify what misconceptions pupils may hold. Next, plan a series of questions to check if your pupils do hold them or not. Lastly, adapt your teaching to address misconceptions that you find.

When identifying misconceptions it's best to focus first on the most significant misconceptions that many pupils hold. Individual pupils will hold lots of specific misconceptions depending on their prior knowledge. But to make this process manageable for teachers it is good to prioritise the most important misconceptions that will create a barrier to learning.

Another thing to bear in mind is that anticipating misconceptions can be hard to do so it's important to draw on the experience of subjects and phase colleagues, which may help. If teachers think about the misconceptions that their pupils are likely to hold about particular content before they teach it to them, then they will be more likely to know what to do when they spot them. They can aim to guide their pupils around misconceptions to prevent them forming part of their mental model.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to identify misconceptions. As you
listen, pay particular attention to how the coach does the following:
<ul>
  <li>Identifies common misconceptions</li>
  <li>
    Uses assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing
    misconceptions
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
The purpose of this model, imagine that I will be teaching my year seven
geography class about plate boundaries and their interactions. I need to make
sure that pupils have a really firm understanding of plate tectonics. As part of
my planning for the lesson, I discuss this with a colleague who had taught the
topic before, and she reminded me that this is something that pupils often get
quite confused about. She highlighted two misconceptions that are particularly
common. Here are the misconceptions.
<ol>
  <li>Each continent has its own plate.</li>
  <li>Continents sit on top of (but apart from) plates.</li>
</ol>
In this instance, a simple true or false question will help. I can get pupils to
read each statement and tell me if they think it is true or false. This will
give me a really quick snapshot of what the whole class believe. If I find out
they hold either misconception, I can deliver a pre-prepared response to address
it there and then.
<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
Let's focus on a couple of things in this model. First, the teacher made sure
that they thought about potential misconceptions in advance of teaching their
lesson. They worked with an experienced colleague who made sure that they were
focusing on a common misconception that many pupils held.

Second, the teacher planned a really quick way of assessing to see if pupils held either misconception by asking a direct question. If they said that either statement was true the teacher can be fairly safe to assume that pupils hold this misconception and so they can adapt their teaching.

Notice how they checked for one misconception at a time. It is important to do this so that you can pinpoint the precise misconception that the pupils hold and then address it.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we considered what the term misconception means and how teachers can
begin to identify them. Before we finish, take a moment to read through the key ideas
that the video has covered. Which of the following ideas do you think that the example
illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced
    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts
  </li>
  <li>
    Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing
    misconceptions
  </li>
  <li>
    Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge
    gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within
    multiple-choice questions)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Knowing your pupils' prior knowledge of misconceptions can help you address
barriers to learning. With sufficient planning to expose gaps in prior knowledge
and misconceptions, you can ensure pupils get the support they need. $EndContent

## Teaching challenge

Ms Brown is confident about what she wants pupils to learn. However, she is often surprised by the gaps in pupils’ knowledge and the misconceptions they sometimes hold. How can she plan to address gaps and misconceptions so all pupils can access the curriculum?

## Key idea

Teachers should proactively find out about pupil prior knowledge and deliberately address common misconceptions and pupil knowledge gaps.

## Evidence summary

### Gaps in pupil prior knowledge and implications for individual needs

Pupils enter the classroom with different prior knowledge. For example, some may have been exposed to a concept intentionally the previous school year, while other teachers did not prioritise the same concept; some may have been introduced to it at home or through personal interest, while others may not. These knowledge gaps have consequences for pupils’ understanding: for example, if they lack important vocabulary, they may not be able to read a text, or may simply misunderstand it (Willingham, 2006). Ms Brown needs to identify who knows what if she is to make new ideas comprehensible by linking them to pupils’ existing knowledge.

### Watching out for misconceptions

Misconceptions are potentially more problematic than knowledge gaps. Misconceptions are distinct from knowledge gaps (where pupils know nothing about a topic) and from errors (for example, a spelling mistake): they are beliefs which conflict with what is to be learned (Chi, 2009). A knowledge gap or an error can be addressed relatively simply but a misconception, whether held by pupils already or developed during a topic, may be harder to address. For example, if pupils believe that an apostrophe should be added whenever they see a plural ‘s’, this is harder for Ms Brown to influence than if a pupil forgot or had never been introduced to the rule.

Most misconceptions are specific to the topic being taught. For example, a common misconception in adding fractions is that pupils should add the numerators and the denominators together. Ms Brown needs to identify common misconceptions: her more-experienced colleagues may have valuable knowledge here. Once Ms Brown has identified likely misconceptions in an upcoming topic, she can check whether pupils have those misconceptions and can seek to overcome them.

### Responding to pupil needs

Ms Brown can anticipate and respond to pupils’ knowledge gaps and misconceptions. Once she has identified the knowledge pupils need to understand a new idea, and the potential misconceptions they may hold or develop, she can design checks of pupil understanding to uncover these barriers for this knowledge (Christodoulou, 2017).

Where she identifies knowledge gaps, she can address them by explicitly teaching anything pupils must know to understand a topic, for example, prerequisite vocabulary, or knowledge which has been introduced in previous years. Where she identifies misconceptions, she can address them by offering analogies which bridge between pupils existing knowledge and their misconception (Luciarello & Naff, n.d.). For example, if pupils believe objects sink because they are heavy (a misconception which confuses weight with density), she can give the example of a ship – which is obviously heavy, but floats – and use this to help pupils appreciate their misconception.

Developing pupils’ subject knowledge also helps all pupils in two ways:

1. By ensuring pupils have increasingly developed and organised mental models upon which they can draw.
2. By reducing the new information actively being processed in pupils’ limited working memory (Sweller et al., 1988).

### Nuances and caveats

While there is much overlap between what pupils know, each pupil will also have unique areas of prior knowledge (and lack of knowledge), based on individual experiences. Identifying exactly what each pupil knows would be impossible for Ms Brown: it’s more important that she identifies the most important knowledge for a topic and whether all pupils know that, than that she identifies everything they do and don’t know (Christodoulou, 2017).

$I

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Ms Brown can better tackle pupil knowledge gaps and misconceptions by understanding
that:
<ul>
  <li>
    A key reason for differing pupil needs is their different levels of prior
    knowledge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pupils may have – or develop – misconceptions: incorrect beliefs about a
    topic or subject.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teachers can identify and overcome these incomplete mental models by using
    knowledge of subject and common misconceptions, for example to generate
    analogies based on existing
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
We want pupils to use what they learn in lots of different ways. We want them to
develop complex mental models so that they can use beyond the classroom but learning
something new takes time. Before we ask pupils to apply what they have learned we
need to ensure that they have acquired it securely in the first place. Acquiring
knowledge takes repeated exposure a cross a sequence of learning.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Before applying knowledge on their own or in different contexts, pupils need to gain
knowledge in the first place. This takes time and effort. For example, pupils need
to know the rules for applying speech marks before applying them accurately in story
writing or pupils need to know that rainforests support a vast number of different
plants and animals in order to fully recognize the impact of deforestation. Relevant
foundational knowledge needs to be secure before pupils encounter more complex content
or think critically, but acquiring knowledge takes time and some content will require
more time and practice to become secure.

Teachers need to ensure that pupils acquire knowledge before they ask them to apply it. In practice they need to think carefully about how they will teach key knowledge and how they will check that pupils have obtained it.

In the early stages of learning, teachers need to give pupils plenty of opportunities to acquire knowledge. We also want pupils to retain what they learn. To help pupils both acquire and retain content, we need to identify relevant prior knowledge to build on and provide a careful balance of exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval. During the exposition stage, it is important to build what pupils already know, and breakdown learning so that it is manageable. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a subject can be beneficial. Repetition of content should be spaced out over a sequence of learning to ensure that pupils have to think hard about what they are learning. During the practice phase, it can be effective to stick to the same task and context as the exposition. Concrete representations of abstract ideas can help pupils in the early stages of acquiring knowledge. For example, in an earlier setting a teacher might ask pupils to recognise the number of oranges in a bowl in order to practise the abstract concepts of subitising, recognising number through visual arrangement. And it is important to come back to the same knowledge again to get pupils to retrieve it from their memory especially after a little time has passed. The short period of time allows a degree of forgetting to set in which makes the act of retrieval harder and therefore strengthens retention of knowledge. The psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, illustrated this in a graph known as the Forgetting Curve. After an initial period of practice sometimes called massed practice, spacing practice outs to allow some forgetting to occur, helps pupils to remember what they learn.

The next step in the journey from acquisition to application is to check pupil understanding. Before teachers ask pupils to apply their knowledge in a different context, they need to check the acquisition is secure. Of course, teachers will be checking for understanding as they go, but it is still important to carry out a check before setting a task that gets pupils to use this knowledge in a different way.

Ultimately, we want pupils to apply what they learn in many different contexts, this enables them to solve problems and to think critically. In order to do this, pupils need to have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they've been asked to think critically about.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of checking for how securely pupils acquired
some content. As you watch, pay particular attention to how the coach does the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Identifies essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the
    subject and provides opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these
    critical components
  </li>
  <li>
    Sequences lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before
    encountering more complex content
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
Imagine that I am teaching a year 5 science lesson. The topic is adaptions and
we're looking at how plants and animals have adapted to extreme environments.
Now in the first lesson, I introduced the concept of the food chain, the key
vocabulary and the flow of energy through that food chain. And at the end of the
lesson last week, the class showed a good level of understanding. However, I
want to revisit some of those key concepts through doing some retrieval practice
and checking for understanding as this is core knowledge which will be built
upon later in the unit. I want to ensure that every pupil has a solid
understanding of the content and embeds the ideas into their long term memory.
I'm going to ask questions and pupils will show me their answers on whiteboards
and this is a routine that is now really well-established. And I want to check
that pupils know the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    To know that a producer is a living thing that produces its own food from
    sunlight
  </li>
  <li>
    To know that a consumer is a living thing that doesn’t make its own food and
    gets is energy from eating either plants or animals
  </li>
  <li>To know that a primary consumer eats the producer</li>
</ul>
<em>
  "Okay, so the last time we did some work on this, we did some thinking about
  food chains. Now food chains are an energy transfer from one species to
  another and all living things need energy for growth and for health. Now we're
  just going to check some of your knowledge on that before we build on it with
  new content and so we're going to do a retrieval quiz.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  In a moment, you're going to see some questions on the board. There'll be
  three options to choose from, one of those will be correct. So you're going to
  have A, B and C and only one will be correct. To show me what you're thinking,
  I want you to write down the letter on the whiteboard of the response that you
  think is the correct answer. And then I will count down as usual from three,
  two, one, and then say, show me.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  So if you get your whiteboard and pen and you'll have 20 seconds to do that
  and then show me you're ready by folding your arms and facing this way. Okay.
  Go.
</em>

<em>[Pupils get whiteboards ready]</em>

<em>
   Right, so we've got question one here, and we're thinking about what is the
  definition of a producer? Option A: Is a living thing that does not produce
  its own food. Is it B: A living thing that produce its own food from sunlight,
  nutrients and water? Or is it option C: A living or non-living thing that
  produces its own food from sunlight, nutrients, and water. You've got five
  seconds to write your answer on your whiteboard. Three, two, one, show me.{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupils hold their white boards up and teacher scans the class]</em>

<em>
  Okay. Demi, now you've chosen option B, just talk me through why you didn't
  choose option C.
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>

<em>
  Okay. Great, I'm really pleased that you pulled out the fact that a producer
  is a living thing that produces its own food. Great. Alright everyone, so
  here's our next question. Which animal in this food chain is the secondary
  consumer?{" "}
</em>

<em>(A) Grass     (B) Caterpillar   (C) Black Widow Spider </em>

<em>Write down your answers. Three, two, one, show me. </em>

<em>[Pupils hold their white boards up and teacher scans the class]</em>

<em>
  Okay. So it looks like a lot of us here have selected option B. It's not
  actually the correct response but I need to understand why we've chosen it. Is
  there anybody willing to share their thinking? Mohammed thanks, what do you
  think?{" "}
</em>

<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>

<em>
  Right, okay, I can see what you're thinking. B is a consumer but is it the
  primary consumer? It's the first one in the chain to eat the producer. What
  we've got here is the next one in the chain and this would be the secondary
  consumer. What's confusing though, is here it's number two in our list. What
  might help is if I pop some headings above.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  [Teacher annotates example on whiteboard] So here, we've got our producer. Our
  first consumer, it's eating the producer so we call this one, our primary and
  then the answer to our question that we were looking for is the black widow
  spider, is our secondary consumer.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Okay, so let's look at another one. Which animal in this food chain is the
  secondary consumer? Is it A: grass, B: grasshopper or C: frog?{" "}
</em>

<em>Grass – (B) Grasshopper – (c) Frog – Python – Eagle </em>

<em>Write your answers down. Three, two, one, show me.”</em>

So I'd like to draw your attention to some key points in this model. So first, before designing my check for understanding questions I thought about the essential knowledge of this unit which the pupils need to acquire. In this case, I identified that it's essential that pupils know what a producer and a consumer is, and that they can explain the difference between a primary and a secondary consumer. I prioritized my questions on this because I need to be sure that my pupils are secure about this particular content.

Second, I sequenced this lesson to check that pupils were secure about this foundational knowledge right from the beginning. So any gaps or misconceptions at this stage could cause problems later in the topic. And also if pupils are under-confident with the knowledge itself, they would not be successful at the independent practice later in this lesson. It's crucial that I check the most important content before moving on and getting them to apply it.

When designing the questions I considered some of the misconceptions that were common and rational and included these to check that pupils had a really secure understanding of the foundational knowledge. I was conscious that if I included false statements that were obviously false, the pupils may guess the answers and that could really get in the way of understanding how pupil learning is going.

By checking for gaps in knowledge or misconceptions, and then addressing them, I can increase the chance of pupils' success in future learning.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored why it is important that pupils acquire knowledge
before teachers ask them to apply it and some of the ways in which teachers can tell
that knowledge is secure. Before we finish, take a moment to read over the key ideas
that we have covered. Which of the following ideas do you think that the example
best illustrates?
<ul>
  <li>
    Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the
    subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these
    critical components
  </li>
  <li>
    Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before
    encountering more complex content
  </li>
  <li>
    Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical
    knowledge and skills
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Learning something new takes time. We need to be patient and allow for lots of
opportunities to practice because this hard work will be worth it. Acquiring
knowledge securely helps pupils to apply it in lots of different ways.

## Teaching challenge

Ms Smith has a clear sense of her learning goals and is confident at breaking the curriculum down into small, meaningful components. However, she struggles to know how quickly can she get pupils doing complicated thinking and when should she introduce more sophisticated tasks.

## Key idea

Students must develop solid foundations of knowledge through carefully sequenced teaching and practice if they are to develop and apply sophisticated mental models.

## Evidence summary

### Mastering foundational knowledge and linking using core concepts

Ms Smith is already aware of the value of building her pupils’ subject knowledge, the risks of pupils’ misconceptions and the potential for knowledge gaps. She wants her students to solve problems and think critically, but they cannot do so if they have critical knowledge gaps and she has noticed that weak prior knowledge leads to misconceptions. This is because pupils use knowledge integrated in their long-term memory to learn more complex ideas and successfully apply what they have learned (Deans for Impact, 2015).

This implies that:

1. The sequence in which knowledge is introduced is crucial. For example, pupils are likely to struggle to evaluate the effectiveness of international aid if they are unclear about the challenges facing developing countries. They are likely to struggle to master algebra if their grasp of number is weak. This means Ms Smith needs to sequence the introduction of new ideas carefully so that _foundational knowledge_ is introduced first. It also means she needs to check pupils have relevant prior knowledge before she introduces new ideas.
2. Ms Smith needs to highlight the link between past learning and new ideas to pupils – or help pupils to make those links themselves – so that they gain a deeper and better organised understanding of the subject. Pupils learn new ideas with reference to what they already know (Deans for Impact, 2015), but Ms Smith cannot be sure they will make these links unprompted. Using core concepts help with these links.

Having broken down the knowledge she hopes pupils will gain and sequenced this carefully through one or more lessons, she can identify effective ways to introduce these ideas.

### Teaching abstract ideas

Ms Smith needs to ensure pupils acquire foundational knowledge and core concepts successfully, and that she does not begin more complicated activities too soon. It’s easy for a relative expert in a topic – like Ms Smith – to grasp the abstract concepts and apply them. For example, she sees ongoing struggles over how much power ordinary people have throughout the political events of the nineteenth century; she uses symbolic representations of chemical reactions to understand what is happening in an (invisible) chemical reaction; and she can use the slope and intercept within a line graph to write an equation for that graph. However, for novices, abstract ideas can be particularly hard to grasp. If Ms Smith opens each of these topics with the abstract ideas, pupils may struggle to grasp them.

Concrete examples are much easier to understand (Willingham, 2009): in each case, pupils are likely to find it easier to first encounter the concrete example then to identify the underlying abstract principle. For pupils to be able to use both, Ms Smith needs to connect and integrate abstract and concrete ideas, and show the links between them (Pashler et al., 2007). An understanding of the abstract features allows pupils to successfully apply subject knowledge and concepts in new situations: for example, an understanding of the structure of a narrative can help them comprehend a new text.

### Checking pupil understanding and offering opportunities for practice

Ms Smith needs to check pupil understanding before beginning tasks which ask pupils to apply their new learning. She could use diagnostic questions, presenting pupils with several options, working with colleagues to identify answers which are either correct or common misconceptions. Pupils responses allow her to identify pupils who hold misconceptions and ensure they have grasped key ideas before continuing (Christodoulou, 2017). Ms Smith needs to ask herself, “how would I know pupils have acquired enough knowledge to practise successfully?”

Once pupils have enough knowledge, Ms Smith can ensure pupils practise applying it through meaningful tasks which promote their learning of new ideas (Willingham, 2009). Although pupils will initially have inflexible knowledge – knowledge which they struggle to apply to new contexts – through continued thinking and processing of new ideas, they will come to use this knowledge increasingly flexibly (Willingham, 2002).

### **Nuances and caveats**

Ensuring pupils have mastered foundational knowledge and core concepts depends on first identifying what is core – fundamental to understanding the topic and discipline – which she will return to many times to ensure pupils have successfully acquired them.

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
We want our pupils to remember and use what we teach them in the long term. We want
them to be able to solve complex problems in the wider world. In order to do that,
their knowledge needs to be deeply rooted so that they don't forget it and well connected
so that they can spot when they should use it. To deepen understanding, teachers
need to give pupils plenty of opportunities to think about new content and help them
to connect that knowledge together.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Deepening understanding means thinking of ways to ensure that pupils can remember
and use what they learn in the long term. It means helping pupils to develop knowledge
that is securely embedded so that they don't forget it. It also means ensuring that
knowledge is well connected. This makes it more likely that pupils will be able to
transfer their knowledge from one context to another, which can be hard to do. For
example, if pupils connect business letters with formal writing and they know the
different elements of formal writing when they are given a task to write a business
letter it should prompt them to recall relevant knowledge such as:
<ul>
  <li>to write in a formal style</li>
  <li>to limit overly descriptive language</li>
  <li>to avoid the use of abbreviations.</li>
</ul>
The better connected our knowledge is, the more useful it is to us. How then can
teachers help pupils to deepen their understanding?

One way to ensure a depth of understanding is to identify the essential concepts, knowledge and skills of a subject, and revisit these big ideas over time. There is a limit to how many ideas teachers can revisit, so they need to make sure that they are selecting the most important ones. What is the core content of a lesson or unit of work?

Another way to deepen understanding is to help pupils develop connections between content. In particular it can be helpful if teachers switch between concrete examples and abstract concepts and make links between the two clear. Concrete examples tend to be specific to a particular task, whereas abstract concepts can apply across a range of different examples. Abstract concepts are like the glue that holds related content together. This is likely to help pupils to retrieve relevant content in the future. For example, when teaching multiplication, you might first use physical objects to create multiple groups and show that say 2 X 3 = 6. This would be a good concrete example. Later you might introduce multiplication of written numbers sticking with two times, again, as an abstract example.

Finally, teachers can provide pupils with a range of different examples when teaching key concepts. Not only does this help pupils to identify the underlying principles that occur in each example, but it also provides them with more opportunities to create connections between content. In English, teachers might teach the concept of tragedy in a variety of texts, such as "Othello", "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible" and see how it is similar and different in each context. Regular purposeful practice of content across a range of different contexts helps pupils to develop a more secure understanding. Varying the context of practice can also help pupils to develop knowledge which they can apply more widely.

Ultimately, deepening understanding is about building mental models that are securely rooted and well connected. The greater the depth of understanding, the more likely pupils are to remember and apply what they learn in the future.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see a model of how to interleave concrete and abstract
examples. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Draws attention to the underlying structure of problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>
For the purpose of this model, imagine I'm teaching a year seven geography
class. I'm going to explain to them what a protective measure is. I'm doing this
so that I can model how to interleave concrete and abstract examples.

<em>
  “We can't prevent natural hazards from occurring. What we can do is put into
  place measures to reduce their impact on local populations. We call these
  protective measures. They're put in place in advance of a natural hazard in
  order to reduce the amount of damage the natural hazard causes.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Today, we're going to look at an example from a country where earthquakes are
  common. One example of a protective measure against earthquakes is to design
  our buildings to absorb the earthquake's energy. One way of doing this is
  called cross bracing where a structure comprised of steel beams crossing each
  other is built into the building, supporting the building's frame [teacher
  draws example on white board]
</em>

<em>
  The cross bracing absorbs the energy from the earthquake preventing the
  building from falling down. So the architects have thought about this while
  they were designing the building. They thought about it in advance of an
  earthquake happening. They haven't prevented the earthquake from occurring,
  but they've reduced the amount of damage that the earthquake does.”
</em>

In this model, there are several examples where I interleaved concrete and abstract content. The original definition of a protective measure is an abstract concept. A protective measure is something we put in place in advance of a natural hazard to reduce the effect it might have. Using cross bracing when designing buildings, so that they absorb energy from an earthquake is a concrete example of this abstract. This concrete example helps people as to understand what I mean by a protective measure. It gives them something to hold onto.

Secondly, I drew attention to the underlying structure that is present in both the abstract concept and the concrete example. I did this by using precisely the same language both times. I talked about putting things in place in advance and to reduce the effect. By using the same language, I'm repeating the underlying structure which helps people to notice it. It isn't enough to simply alternate between abstract and concrete concepts. Teachers also need to identify how they are similar. The underlying structure is present in both examples and it has this underlying structure that we want pupils to remember.

To create this example, I came up with a definition of the abstract concept, identified a concrete example, and look for ways in which the example illustrated key aspects of the concept that I'd included in my definition.

This is just one way in which teachers can interleave abstract and concrete examples to deepen understanding. To be effective, teachers need to look for ways to do this across a sequence of learning and gradually reduce the need to rely on concrete examples as a support.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have looked at why it is important to deepen pupil understanding.
And some of the ways in which teachers may do this. Take a moment now to read over
the key ideas that we have covered. Which of the following ideas do you feel the
example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts
    through a range of examples
  </li>
  <li>
    Interleaving concrete and abstract examples, slowly withdrawing concrete
    examples and drawing attention to the underlying structure of problems
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Whatever subject or phase we are teaching, it is important to remember that
teaching pupils something once or in just one way will never be enough to
provide a secure understanding. Instead, we need to look for ways that we can
deepen understanding so that pupils can retain and use what they learn in lots
of different ways.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones has worked to identify and convey the key ideas in each topic to his pupils. However, he wants pupils to develop more than a basic, inflexible knowledge of the facts: he wants them to develop sophisticated mental models of the subject which allow them to apply what they have learnt to new and complex problems. How can he support his pupils to develop the kind of mental model which makes this deep thinking possible?

## Key idea

Teachers can develop increasingly complex pupil mental models by promoting practise of thinking which supports pupils to access and apply their subject knowledge flexibly; carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

## Evidence summary

### Deep thinking requires background knowledge

Mr Jones wants his pupils to be able to tackle new problems, to think critically and to be creative. Pupils must have good mental models to do so. Mr Jones cannot simply ask his pupils to think critically about a source, a problem or an image. This is because pupils need background knowledge, an understanding of how to think critically in the subject and the habits of doing so (Bailin et al., 1999). For example, to think critically about the design of an experiment, pupils need to know what effective experiment design looks like, what equipment is available, the goal of the experiment and so on. In the same vein, they rely on existing mental models to solve problems and come up with ideas which are creative but also feasible.

### Deep thinking relies on flexible knowledge

The first step in developing mental models to permit deep thinking is moving from inflexible to flexible knowledge. When pupils learn about a new idea, their knowledge is inflexible: tied to the context in which it was learned. This cannot be avoided, it is how new information enters long-term memory: “a natural step on the way to the deeper knowledge that we want our students to have” (Willingham, 2002). For example, if Mr Jones introduces addition through an example about a child collecting feathers, pupils will associate it initially with feathers.

Having gained inflexible knowledge, pupils’ knowledge can become more flexible if they access it through different cues: increasingly varied and difficult questions with decreasing amounts of scaffolding and hints.

Effective forms of variation include:

- **Contextual variation:** Encountering the same knowledge in different contexts.
- **Conceptual variation:** Presenting examples and non-examples to refine understanding.
- **Situational variation:** Providing a broad range of application problems in pursuit of a more generalised understanding of a concept (Pan & Rickard, 2018).

By doing this, Mr Jones balances the desire to make the task more difficult – increasing the level of thinking required – and the wish to ensure pupils’ continued success, for its own sake and to maintain their motivation.

### Transfer is more likely if pupils are proficient at accessing their knowledge

Mr Jones also wants pupils to be able to transfer what they learn to new topics, and even to other subjects within and beyond school. Transfer means being able to apply existing knowledge to new questions and situations (Barnett & Ceci, 2002). For example, he may want pupils to recognise that they can use a previously learned technique to answer a new question – using the idea of perimeter in a more complex maths problem, or maybe an everyday problem they need to solve. He may want them to see similarities between topics or ideas and themes across lessons, topics, or subjects. However, transfer is difficult and does not come naturally – pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.

Transfer can be supported by retrieval practice – the act of recalling prior knowledge. After completing a unit, pupils can be asked to retrieve core knowledge and concepts frequently to ensure they retain them (Pashler et al., 2007). This makes it more likely that pupils will be able to transfer knowledge to new contexts (Pan & Rickard, 2018). When planning, teachers should think about which aspects of subject knowledge are most significant for pupils – ideas and concepts that are pre-requisite to developing knowledge in other topics – and build in retrieval practice to ensure that that these are readily accessible.

### Pupils must practise deep thinking

Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help pupils to develop and consolidate their mental models (Pashler et al., 2007). If Mr Jones wants pupils to transfer ideas to new or unfamiliar contexts, or to think deeply, he must show them how to do so and offer opportunities to practise. Mr Jones should seek to show pupils the links between topics he hopes they will make. He might say: “we can use what you have learned in English about paragraph structure and grammar when writing in history. You have also been studying Victorian novels which you can use to illustrate what some Victorians might have thought about the Industrial Revolution, as long as you make clear it’s fiction. What other learning can we use to make our historical writing better?”. Likewise, if he wants them to think critically about a topic, he has to offer practice in this kind of thinking, he cannot rely on the accumulation of factual knowledge to lead to critical thinking automatically.

### Nuances and caveats

Transfer and critical thinking are both hard: neither of them come naturally – if teachers want pupils to think critically and to transfer knowledge to new contexts, they must teach this explicitly and allow pupils to practice doing so.

Pupils cannot exercise critical thinking without a strong knowledge of the thing about which they are being invited to think critically: teachers are unlikely to experience success if they teach critical thinking skills in isolation or expect pupils to transfer knowledge from one context to another without practise and models.

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Mr Jones can promote deep thinking by:
<ul>
  <li>
    Seeing deep thinking as an extension of pupils’ mental models of the
    subject.
  </li>
  <li>Helping pupils access knowledge more</li>
  <li>
    Showing pupils how to apply knowledge to new problems and contexts and
    supporting them to practise this.

<h3>Presenter intro: Chloe Wardle</h3>
Literacy is essential for learning. Literacy is about words that we encounter in
speech and text and the ways in which we use them. Whatever subject you teach, words
are a critical way in which you share meaning. Every subject provides opportunities
to develop pupil literacy and every teacher needs to consider how they can do this
well.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>
Literacy is about our use of words. To access the curriculum, pupils need to understand
the meaning of a vast array of words, whether they come across them in speech or
text. Literacy applies to speaking, listening, reading and writing. When it applies
to reading, literacy is the ability to read words through sight recognition and decoding
using phonological knowledge and to comprehend their meaning within a specific context.

But words alone are not enough. Literacy is also about knowledge. In order to comprehend what someone says to us or what we read, we need to draw on what we know in order to accurately interpret the words that they use. For example, if pupils read a text about an area of wetlands, they will need to know what a wetland is even in very basic terms before they can properly understand what they read. In a science classroom, we may teach pupils specific words to label the different parts of the heart but if they don't know that the heart is the organ that pumps blood around the body, they will find it much harder to understand what these words mean or to remember them. This also applies to knowledge of how we read and write certain texts. If you don't know how an information text is typically organized, for example, you'll find it harder to follow what it means. As well as thinking about the words that they use, teachers need to ensure that pupil secure the underlying knowledge that they need for understanding.

Given that literacy is so critical to all learning, what are some of the practical ways in which all teachers can develop pupil literacy? Teachers need to plan for, teach, model and provide opportunities to practise the various aspects of literacy that they want to develop.

To begin with, teachers need to think about how they can develop pupils' vocabulary. Lots of the words that pupils come across at school will be unfamiliar. We need to identify key words in advance and explicitly teach them to pupils. When teaching a new word, one strategy that teachers can use is to introduce the word, define it using words that pupils will understand and then give a few examples of its use in practice. Teachers can continue to use this specific vocabulary in their own speech, scaffolding pupil understanding by pausing to clarify what it means. Teachers also need to give pupil lots of opportunities to practise using new vocabulary. Getting pupils to use new words in speech first can be particularly effective. Oral literacy supports reading and writing. One way of developing vocabulary through oracy is to provide vocabulary banks of keywords and ask pupils to rephrase what they say with words from the vocabulary bank. Practising using vocabulary and speech helps pupils to learn new words and refine their thinking.

Teachers also need to think about how they can teach words that are specific to a subject. These are called tier three words and pupils may not encounter them outside of the subject but they will help pupils to access and think about a subject if they know them. Words like evaporation, circumference and figurative language. Also every subject has its own styles of writing. Pupils need to see a model of a particular type of text and teachers need to identify its key features. Writing frames can be a useful tool to support pupils as they learn about different types of texts.

Some lessons will provide more opportunities than others to develop literacy. A lesson that's focused primarily on a practical task like learning to kick a football will provide fewer opportunities to develop literacy than an English lesson. But even in entirely practical lessons, teachers and pupils still use words. Teachers need to choose the words that they use carefully and make the most of every opportunity they have to develop pupil literacy.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see one way of teaching a new word to a class. As you
watch, pay particular attention to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Provides a concrete model of the word that she is teaching</li>
  <li>Uses high-quality talk to support pupils to extend their vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>I want you to imagine that I'm
teaching a year four class during a unit of work on the Romans. I'm going to
model how to explicitly teach a new word them. It's early on in the unit and
we're learning about when and why the Romans first invaded Britain. In this
example, I want to explicitly teach the word and meaning of the word invade. I
want to be sure that all the class know the word as it's important for their

  “In 55 and 54 B.C., the Roman army invaded Britain. My turn, your turn,

  The word invade means when a group of people enter country to take control and

<em>
  Thank you. An invasion is when a group of people enter country to take control
  and to steal its resources. Elliot is partly right. Often when a group
  invades, there is a battle but not always. So we're not going to include that
  in our definition.{" "}
</em>

<em>
  Now with your partner, come up with a sentence that uses the word invade or
  invaded. Use what you know about the Vikings to help you with your sentences.
  One minute.”
</em>

I want to draw your attention to a couple of features of this model. Remember that the purpose was to explicitly teach a new word. First, I explicitly introduced the word invade. I said the word clearly and ask the class to repeat it. I did this for two reasons: firstly, I wanted pupils to experience saying the word so I could ensure that the pronunciation was correct. Secondly, I focused the class's attention on the word itself. I then gave pupils a clear definition of what the word invade means with a few more examples. This is a routine that I have developed with pupils and they now understand it well. They knew that when I said your turn, they needed to state the word back to me in unison.

Second, I used high quality talk to help the pupils extend their vocabulary. Pupils practise using the word invade first in pairs. This helps them to process their understanding of it and rehearse using it in a safe context. Pupils often stumble when learning new vocabulary so this time practising it is really important. Once pupils had a go trying out the word and pairs, I got them to share their sentences. The time that pupils have practising the word increased the quality of their talk to the whole class.

After this, I would have got pupils to write down a definition in their books, using key words as a scaffold. This concept will come up lots in history units so it's important that pupils are secure with it. I'll support pupils to use the word invade by using it my teaching and including it in vocabulary banks or talking and writing frames. These supports will be gradually withdrawn as pupils demonstrate that they have successfully acquired this new word.

<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>
In this video, we have explored the importance of developing pupil literacy and highlighted
some practical ways in which all teachers can do this. Before we finish, take a moment
to read over the key ideas that we have covered. Which of the following ideas do
you think that the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Recognise that every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by
    explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to
    individual disciplines
  </li>
  <li>
    Know that modelling helps pupils to understand new processes and ideas; good
    models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible
  </li>
  <li>
    Know that high-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key
    ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary
  </li>

<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
Literacy is fundamental to pupils' success in school and their future life
chances. The more literate pupils are, the more that they can understand and
learn. Improving pupils' generic and subject specific literacy through explicit
teaching, modelling and talk can help pupils to access a subject and drive
learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones is increasingly successful in developing pupils’ mental models and helping them to grasp crucial ideas. However, he has become concerned that their written work is not keeping pace with their understanding. He notices pupils struggling to master and use technical vocabulary, and to articulate key ideas clearly. How can Mr Jones improve pupils’ literacy within his subject, and more generally?

## Key idea

Teachers can improve pupils’ literacy – in general and specific to their subject – through explicit teaching, modelling and carefully-planning reading, writing and speaking activities.

## Evidence summary

### Every lesson is a chance to improve pupils’ literacy

To understand a text, pupils must both recognise the words (by decoding what sounds the letters make in this combination) and comprehend their meaning (EEF, 2018). English and literacy lessons support pupils to improve in both.

However, Mr Jones sees every lesson as a chance to improve pupils’ literacy. Partly, this is because every lesson is a chance to reinforce and build upon what pupils learn in English and literacy lessons. Pupils benefit from additional opportunities to increase their vocabulary, to read and to practise articulating their thoughts; this may also help them to grasp the underlying principles better. In particular, additional opportunities to read are one of the most powerful ways to encounter new knowledge and to increase their vocabulary (Willingham, 2009).

Moreover, English and literacy lessons do not teach the technical terms and styles of writing specific to different subjects (Scott et al., 2018): each teacher must teach the vocabulary and writing structures specific to their subject.

### Developing pupils’ vocabulary

Mr Jones plans to improve pupils’ vocabulary in the same way he plans other aspects of the lesson. He identifies critical words – high frequency words that pupils will use often and high utility words that are particularly important in his subject – and introduces them explicitly. He finds it useful to distinguish between:

- **Tier 1 vocabulary:** Everyday words, which might need to be taught explicitly, such as ‘good’, ‘child’ or ‘Sunday’.
- **Tier 2 vocabulary:** Words which appear across the curriculum but less commonly in everyday speech, such as ‘examine’, ‘deceive’ or ‘forthright’.
- **Tier 3 vocabulary:** Words which are specific to a subject: for example, in science, pupils need to grasp the scientific meaning of terms such as ‘evaporation’ (Beck et al., 2002; EEF, 2018).

His focus is on teaching Tier 2 words – which pupils are unlikely to pick up without teaching – and Tier 3 words, which they are unlikely to encounter outside his lessons.

### Modelling reading and writing

Models are a powerful way to show pupils how to articulate key ideas. Models help pupils understand new processes and ideas by making them more concrete and accessible (Willingham, 2009). For any written task, pupils need to see an example – or ideally more than one – and break it into its constituent parts: this may mean examining examples of coherent sentences, clear reports or well-structured essays. Pupils can use these as models to guide their own writing. Likewise, teachers can model the process of reading and writing: for example, articulating their own thinking such as the questions and predictions they are making, or showing pupils how expert readers comprehend texts (EEF, 2016).

### Talking is preparation for writing

Classroom dialogue is an opportunity for pupils to practise articulating ideas clearly: this is both valuable for its own sake and to consolidate pupils’ understanding in preparation for their writing. Promoting better talk practices in classrooms directly improves pupils’ outcomes in core subjects and appears to improve their confidence and participation (Jay et al., 2017). For example, Mr Jones might model accurate use of terminology and the language structures he hopes pupils will use. He could also invite pupils to articulate their ideas fully and accurately in speech. Doing so is an opportunity for them to practise and refine how they express ideas, making subsequent writing easier.

### Nuances and caveats

While literacy development can be a feature of every lesson, some will lend themselves to this better than others. All subjects have specialist vocabulary which pupils should be taught to use accurately; likewise, all subjects can promote high-quality talk during discussion.

However, if the key learning goal is practical – learning to pass a football correctly, shade accurately or master times tables – teachers should not feel that they are expected to create written activities solely to promote generic literacy.

Promoting literacy might also look different at different ages. For example, for younger pupils, a priority is reading fluently and writing fluently and legibly, whereas once pupils have mastered this they may benefit from improving their reading comprehension skills, or from more time planning, drafting and editing their writing (EEF, 2018).

Promoting reading for pleasure, by using a range of whole class reading approaches and regularly exposing pupils to high quality texts, can also support literacy development (EEF, 2016).

<h3>Presenter introduction</h3>
Showing pupils what an example of good looks like gives them a clear goal to aim
for. But just showing it on its own is not enough. Teachers need to identify the
precise features that make the example effective. We need to break it down for our
pupils. Academic expectations need to be clear, concrete and specific if we want
our pupils to meet them.
<h3>Expert insight</h3>
Knowing what success looks like helps pupils to achieve, particularly when the teachers
point out the details within a successful piece of work. Concrete examples help to
convey complicated concepts to pupils. They also help pupils to see what good looks
like. Knowing what good looks like can in turn help pupils to monitor their work
more effectively, leading to improved learning.

There are several ways that teachers can share academic expectations. Constructing models that shows pupils what good looks like make abstract goals concrete. Hearing that they need to “argue more systematically” doesn’t mean anything unless you already know what “arguing systematically” means and looks like. Showing examples can help. For example, a teacher might present pupils with a neatly formed letter, an accurate labelling of a diagram or a good introduction to an essay.

When teachers present models, they need to direct pupils’ attention to the important features within them. Without doing this, pupils often skip over them entirely or miss key details. Also, novice learners tend to focus on surface level features that are specific to one particular model. Showing a range of different examples can help pupils to see the underlying principles that are present in each of them. Seeing a range of different ways to write the introduction to an essay question can show pupils that whereas they may have different ideas to share, introductory paragraphs should always respond to the question and present the main ideas that the essay will discuss. Knowing what a good example looks like before attempting a task can help pupils to plan how to carry it out effectively, give them something to compare their work to as they monitor how it is going and evaluate against once it is completed.

Once pupils have a detailed understanding of what good looks like, teachers can encourage pupils to monitor their work by comparing their responses to the model.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see coach Matea Marcink present a model answer to her
class and identify the key features that she wants them to include in their own work.
As you watch, pay attention to how she achieves the following key ideas:
<ul>
  <li>
    Sets tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a
    challenging curriculum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Narrates thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts
    think.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
Imagine that I am teaching a Year Seven geography lesson. We have been looking
at the impact of transnational corporations on Nigeria’s development and I want
them to answer a question that summarises their learning through a case study of
the fast food chain KFC.

I am going to model a response to the question, narrating my thought processes and pointing out what makes this answer good.

“In a moment, you are going to answer a question. I’m going to show you one way of responding to it so that you can see how to do this well. Here is the question: ‘Explain whether you think that the presence of KFC is a positive or negative development for Nigeria.’

“First, let’s have a look at the key words in the question. It is asking you to explain what you think. I need to decide if I think that KFC being in the country is a positive or negative for Nigeria and then I need to justify my answer using the evidence from the text.

“Second, I need to come up with some ideas. I’m going to think about what we have learnt this lesson. We have learnt that there are both positives and negatives to KFC being in Nigeria. But on balance, I think that KFC is a negative development for Nigeria. So that is going to be my first sentence. You might decide the opposite to me, that KFC is positive for Nigeria, and that’s totally fine, as the question is asking for your opinion.

“I’m going to use some of the words from the question to help me get started. It says, “Explain whether you think that the presence of KFC is a positive or negative development for Nigeria.” So I’m going to say in my head, I think that the presence of KFC in Nigeria is and then write: (writing on the visualizer and reading aloud) I think that the presence of KFC in Nigeria is negative because

“Right, now I need to justify my answer with evidence from the text. I’m going to justify my answer with three reasons from the text. There are more than three reasons in the text, so I need to choose the three that match my opening statement, that it is a negative presence. And I want to choose the three strongest reasons. “

This is just the opening of the model, but it is enough to demonstrate some of the key ideas about sharing good examples with pupils.

First, the task itself is challenging. Pupils have to pull together a range of different pieces of evidence into a coherent argument. They have to recall what they know about development in Nigeria and apply it to the question. Pupils are supported to achieve this task because I know that they have a good understanding of the content. The model that I am providing here is another form of support.

Second, I narrated my thought processes out loud to show pupils how experts think. For example,: “I’m going to use some of the words from the question to get me started.” This may seem like an obvious thing to do, but pupils often struggle to get started so it is worth pointing it out. How can we be sure that pupils will know to do this if nobody has ever told them?

Finally, I drew attention to some of the features of the example that made it good. In particular, I stressed that the evidence that I select needs to match with my overall point. Again, this is something that experts who know how to construct a good argument would do instinctively. But in order to develop expertise, it helps if we identify the specific knowledge and skills that it is made up of.

Providing a model of an excellent response does not remove all of the cognitive effort required. This isn’t about getting pupils to copy. Pupils will still have to think about the content carefully when writing their own response. The purpose of the model is to help to guide their thinking. In doing this, it increases the likelihood of success.

<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
In this video, we have explored the importance of showing pupils what a model of
success looks like, ensuring that we set our expectations high. Before we finish,
take a moment to read over the key ideas in the video. Which of the following ideas

    more structure early in a domain.
  </li>

    think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working
    independently and drawing pupils’ attention to links with prior knowledge).
  </li>

We all want our pupils to do well, both in school and future life. In order to achieve
academic success, we need to show them what success looks like. Sharing academic
expectations through strong examples can transform understanding and achievement.

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones is gaining confidence in his planning and wants to assess his pupils’ progress. However, he is unsure how to give them the best opportunity to perform well and demonstrate their understanding. He finds that describing the components of a strong piece of work is useful but often insufficient to convey the key ideas. How can he share his academic expectations for pupils concretely and clearly?

## Key idea

Effectively directing pupil attention to high quality models helps pupils succeed by clarifying subject goals. Practise and metacognition help them apply these to their own work.

## Evidence summary

### Models show pupils how to succeed

Conveying academic expectations to pupils is challenging. Effective teachers set goals that challenge and stretch pupils, while providing enough support to make it likely pupils will succeed (Coe et al., 2014). Previously, Mr Jones has focused on describing to pupils what they need to do to succeed. However, he has found this problematic: he invites pupils to structure sentences “carefully”, to select the “most telling quotations” and to approach their work “methodically”. Some pupils seem able to do this but for others his advice appears not to help. Mr Jones realises that these concepts may be too abstract to be easily applied by many pupils so he needs a better way to convey them (Christodoulou, 2017).

Models can show what pupils need to do to succeed. Mr Jones has already encountered the power of a concrete example in making abstract curricular concepts and ideas accessible. He realises that they can also be used to show pupils how to succeed in a specific task. He can use models to demonstrate the components of a good response and the process behind constructing one. One approach is to show pupils completed models, such as a finished calculation, sentence, or essay paragraph. He can also show pupils the process of creating an answer, either by showing finished worked examples (Sweller et al., 1998) – for example, the stages of a sum or an edited document – or by live modelling: completing a task or editing an answer in front of pupils and talking about his thinking process (EEF, 2017). This is a chance for Mr Jones to share his subject expertise with pupils, by describing the choices he is making and the reasons for them as he is making them.

### How teachers use their models matters

Mr Jones recognises that the design of the model is important but insufficient in helping pupils identify crucial features as pupils may be tempted to skip over examining them (Sweller et al., 1998). Effective modelling involves directing pupils’ attention to the most important aspects. Some specific tasks appear to help pupils engage with models and identify their critical features. These include:

- **Completion problems:** Partially completed examples which pupils finish (Sweller et al., 1998).
- **Example-problem pairs:** An example with an equivalent problem, for the pupil to complete.
- **Examples contrasted with non-examples:** Helping pupils contrast strong and weak responses allows them to identify the crucial features of good answers and those which are less important (Lin-Siegler et al., 2015; EEF, 2018).

The crucial point which Mr Jones appreciates is that just producing a model is insufficient to ensure pupils benefit: he must also design a task which ensures pupils engage with it, effectively modelling the features he wishes to convey.

Mr Jones can also use models to provide feedback and help pupils to improve. For example, once pupils have completed a task, Mr Jones can invite them to return to the model and identify the similarities and differences between their approach and the one illustrated by the model. Alternatively, he can construct a new model which incorporates the strongest (or weakest) features of pupils’ answers, and then invite them to review it and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Pupils can then be invited to revise their own work with the model in mind.

### Promoting metacognition

Models can also promote pupils’ metacognition by helping them to get a clear sense of what their work should look like. This makes it easier for them to plan and monitor their work – comparing what they are doing to the model – and to evaluate their approach by making adaptations if they notice that their work does not exhibit key features shown in the model (EEF, 2017). This may be particularly important where a teacher anticipates common misconceptions may arise about a topic. Pupils may have acquired ideas, either in school or from everyday experience, that are ‘in conflict with’ the to-be-learned concepts (Chi, 2009).

Mr Jones can use his models to draw pupil attention to misconceptions as well as ways to overcome them. For example, as he models how complete a problem, he might ask pupils “What trap are we going to avoid falling into here?” and emphasise that “I’m going to avoid falling into this trap”, showing them what he wants them to do instead. Knowing what is expected of pupils and what they should avoid is therefore a powerful way to help pupils to monitor and evaluate their own work.

### Nuances and caveats

When sharing academic expectations, it is important both to select a high-quality model and use effective instructional approaches when modelling, drawing pupil attention to specific aspects of the model to develop their subject knowledge.

Mr Jones can discuss with experienced colleagues what important misconceptions are to help identify them.

<h3>Presenter introduction</h3>
Every lesson, teachers make lots of decisions that have an impact on what they teach
and what pupils learn. They make decisions about whether a pupil has understood something,
or if they need to go back and re-teach it. In order to ensure that we make good
decisions and act in ways that will have the most impact on pupils’ learning, we
need to ensure that they are based on a good information. Teachers need to design
and deliver formative assessments so that they can make the right decisions.
<h3>Presenter main</h3>A great way of understanding what a formative assessment is,
is to consider the definition that Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam gave in their influential
work, ‘Inside the Black Box.’ An assessment is formative if it is designed to lead
to a change in what the teacher (or student) does. Effective formative assessments
allow teachers to develop an understanding of how learning is going, and make decisions
about how they will adapt their teaching. This is different from summative assessments,
which are designed to demonstrate what pupils have learnt over a long period of time.
By the time that teachers get information back from summative assessments, it is
often too late to do anything about it. Designing and delivering formative assessments
enables teachers find to make decisions about how and what they are teaching as they
go.

Perhaps one of the most important decisions that teachers make and will need to make most regularly is this: I have taught my pupils something. Have they understood it and are they ready to move on? Formative assessments need to be carefully designed so that they give teachers the answers to these important questions. They need to be linked to key learning in the lesson.

In practice, there are a number of key steps that teachers can take when designing formative assessments. 1) Teachers need to identify what the most important content in the lesson is. They also need to identify the most likely misconceptions related to it. We want to know if pupils have understood this key content and if they hold any misconceptions that will get in the way. 2) Teachers need to design a question that tests for one piece of information at a time. This is particularly important for misconceptions: ensure that each question tests for one misconception. That way, you will have a better chance of identifying the specific problem that you need to address 3) One you have designed a question, it is really important that you test it out yourself to check that it tells you want you want to know. Sometimes we come up with what looks like a great question, but when we test it out it doesn’t tell us the information we need. For example, you might want to know whether a pupil can add tens and units together. Say you decide to give them a worded maths problem like: “Adam has ten apples in his basket and puts two more in. How many apples does he have?” The problem with a question like this is that it requires pupils to know how to read as well as how to add tens and units. If they get the answer wrong, how will you know if the problem lies with their ability to add up or with their ability to read? It could be that the pupil’s understanding of addition is secure. In this instance, the teacher won’t be able to use this information to decide whether or not they have understood enough about addition of tens and unit to move on, so it won’t be an effective formative assessment.

As well as designing formative assessments carefully, teachers also need to think about how they can deliver them. Pupils need a positive learning environment in order to feel comfortable making mistakes. It is helpful to explain to pupils why you are giving them an assessment, that you want to know if they have understood what you have taught them and if they are ready to move on.

One further important point to bear in mind about formative assessments is that, while they are good at capturing what pupils have understood in the moment, they are not always the most reliable way of telling you how secure learning is. A correct answer might be a lucky guess, or they might have performed well because the content is fresh in their minds. It is quite possible that pupils will have forgotten by the next lesson. Teachers will need to go back to content to check whether pupils have a secure and lasting understanding. Formative assessment is most useful for identifying pupils’ misconceptions and knowledge gaps.

When designed and delivered well, formative assessments can help show teachers how learning is going and help them make good decisions about what to do next.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will hear a conversation between Ambition Institute coach
Emma Larkin and early career teacher James White. Emma is supporting James to create
a formative assessment task that will test if pupils have understood the key learning
in the lesson. As you watch, pay particular attention to how Emma guides James to
achieve the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Plan a formative assessment task that is linked to the lesson objective
  </li>
  <li>Think ahead about what would indicate understanding</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
Coach: what is the lesson objective

ECT: to form the lower-case letter m.

Coach: let’s think about this in more detail. What key knowledge and skills do you want pupils to achieve in this lesson?

ECT:

To know how to accurately form the letter by:

<ul>
  <li>Starting at the top of the letter</li>
  <li>Using straight lines</li>
  <li>Starting the first curve 2 thirds up the straight line</li>
  <li>Ensuring two curves are the same size</li>
  <li>Adding a flick at the end (feeds forward to cursive handwriting)</li>
</ul>
To be able write slowly and check for accuracy

To be able to say/think the key steps for forming the letter as they write

Coach: What task could you get them to do show that they had understood?

ECT: I could ask a carefully scripted series of questions to the class

Coach: What question would you ask to assess each piece of key learning?

ECT: I can turn a lot of my key knowledge and skills into questions. So instead of “to be able to start forming the letter at the top, I could say: “where should I start when I am forming my letter?”

Other questions are: What should I take care of when drawing my downward line? Where should I start the first curve? What do I need to remember about the second curve? Why do I need to take my time?

Coach: Let’s look at this question in more detail. When you ask “what do I need to remember about the second curve”, Can you be more specific?

ECT: How about “what size should the second mountain be?”

Coach: Great. That narrows the potential answers down. Now let’s test out this question: “Why do I need to take my time?” I imagine that pupils could say something like “to take care” or “so that I can be proud of my work”. But you are testing to check they know that they should be accurate. If they said that they needed to take their time so that they could be proud of their work, would that tell you that they knew to be accurate?

ECT: Not really

Coach: And would it tell you that they didn’t know about the importance of being accurate?

ECT: No, because both answers could work.

Coach: How could you refine the question to make sure that the answer you get tells you what you want to find out?

ECT: I could give them a couple of statements and ask them to choose which one is correct? For example, I could say: “Is it better to write lots of letters quickly or to write one letter accurately?”

Coach: Good idea. Only one of those answers is right, and the right answer (being accurate) tells you what you want to find out.

<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
This is just a short example of a longer coaching session. It doesn’t tell you everything
that you need to know about formative assessment. But it does illustrate a couple
of key ideas. First, the assessment was clearly linked to the lesson objective. Emma
asked James to identify what they most important learning content was and ensured
that he designed questions to test for these. They created one question for each
key idea. If pupils could give a correct answer to each question, there is a good
chance that they had understood enough about how to form the letter m to mean that
they can move onto the next stage of their learning. Secondly, they thought really
carefully about what would indicate understanding. They tested out a range of possible
answers to the question: “Why do I need to take my time?” As a result they realised
that the question itself wasn’t accurate enough: some of the valid answers that pupils
could give would not indicate the understanding that they were looking for. James
may want his pupils to be proud of their work, but the primary reason for taking
their time is so that they can be more accurate. Carefully designing the formative
assessment at the planning stage means that it will provide James with much more
useful information in the lesson. He has taught them how to form the letter M. After
he refined them, his questions should now tell him where pupils understand enough
to move on, or if they need more support.
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
In this video, we have explored the importance of formative assessment and provided
some practical strategies for designing them. Before we finish, take a moment to
read over the key ideas that the video has covered. Which ideas do you think the
example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>Making use of formative assessment</li>
  <li>Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives</li>
  <li>
    Thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using

  </li>
</ul>
The better teachers know what their pupils have understood or misunderstood, the
more they will be able to adapt their teaching in response. When they are designed
and delivered carefully, formative assessments can provide teachers with the information
that they need to make the best decisions in the classroom. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones feels his lessons are increasingly clearly designed and convey the key ideas to his pupils. However, he often feels unsure how much pupils have understood during the lesson or by the end. Sometimes, end-of-unit assessments suggest that pupils have failed to grasp key ideas. How can Mr Jones develop ways to identify what pupils are thinking – and what they have misunderstood – in order to ensure they are all meeting the learning goals?

## Key idea

Effective formative assessment shows the teacher what pupils are thinking: this makes it possible to meet pupils’ needs, making it more likely they will meet learning goals.

## Evidence summary

### The role of summative assessment

Mr Jones encounters many forms of external assessment on a regular basis in school. Often, pupils complete practice versions of external exams or commercially-developed tests in order to demonstrate progress or highlight gaps in their knowledge. However, the information this provides often comes too late to enable him to make the kind of changes he hopes to make. He is unwilling to wait until the end of the key stage to find out exactly how much pupils have understood.

Mr Jones’ initial idea is that he will adapt these external assessments and use them in his lessons. However, this proves problematic. These assessments are designed to demonstrate what pupils have learned over a long period of time (Wiliam & Black, 1996). To do so, many questions integrate knowledge of multiple concepts: a question may ask pupils to draw on their knowledge of algebra and number, to write a paragraph or to compare different concepts. Errors may not tell him whether a pupil lacks basic knowledge, misinterpreted the question or holds an underlying misconception (Christodoulou, 2017).

Creating exams and ensuring they are marked reliably is a complicated, intricate and time-consuming process: this is not something an individual teacher can easily simulate (Christodoulou, 2017). Mr Jones still wants his pupils to succeed in summative assessments and he uses them to help ensure he is teaching everything pupils need to know. Moreover, if he needs to make a summative judgement, he should choose these materials where possible and draw conclusions from patterns of performance over a number of these, while remembering that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance. However, his focus is identifying what pupils have learned - or misunderstood - in order to adapt his teaching accordingly. This means he focuses on using formative assessment.

### The role of formative assessment

An assessment is formative if it is designed to lead to a change in what the teacher (or the student) does (Black & Wiliam, 1998). Effective formative assessment practices help teachers collect evidence about pupil understanding and needs and adapt their teaching to support pupils to be more successful (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Speckesser et al., 2018). Mr Jones is aware of the risk of using ‘poor proxies’ for learning (Coe, 2013): of believing that students have understood because they are busy, engaged, working hard, or answering questions correctly even if they haven’t fully understood or couldn’t reproduce the work independently. All of these are valuable and desirable, but they do not show that pupils have understood the key ideas and avoided misconceptions.

### Designing formative assessment

Mr Jones’ previous work identifying and setting clear learning goals proves useful in formulating precise assessment questions. He focuses on questions that show whether pupils have mastered the key idea in the lesson or whether they hold misconceptions – being particularly mindful of pupils with specific learning barriers linked to special educational needs or disabilities. It helps to design questions with data analysis in mind (Wiliam, 2014) and Mr Jones is mindful of this as he plans formative assessment.

For example, he knows that a fifty-question quiz will provide very detailed information about what every pupil understands but he also knows that he will not have time to review every pupils’ quiz for at least a week. It is better to decide to choose one crucial question – and use the information he gains – than to choose several important questions and run out of time to ask them or assess students’ answers. However, Mr Jones is aware that he will still need to be cautious about the conclusions he draws: pupils may produce correct answers now but struggle to recreate them in future (Coe, 2013; Christodoulou, 2017).

### Using formative assessment

Once he has designed a formative assessment, Mr Jones applies it in class. He appreciates the need to gain a response from all pupils independently, since the answer of one pupil in discussion may influence that of other pupils. As a result, he gets his pupils to respond simultaneously, using whiteboards or on paper. Having collected the data, he is able to analyse it, adapt teaching and provide feedback as appropriate.

### Nuances and caveats

Formative assessment, such as end of class questioning, is a powerful way to identify what pupils have understood in the moment. However, getting an answer correct one day doesn’t mean that pupils will recall it in future: they are very likely to forget some of it. Formative assessment is most useful for identifying pupils’ misconceptions or knowledge gaps and addressing them.

Formative assessment is an approach, not a technique. Using mini-whiteboards, exit tasks or hinge questions does not mean a teacher is using formative assessment: what matters is why and how they are used: if they are used to find out what pupils understand and to improve their understanding, the teacher is using formative assessment and practising responsive teaching (Christodoulou, 2017).

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Mr Jones can check pupils’ developing understanding by:
<ul>
  <li>
    Recognising that summative assessment has value but that it cannot provide
    rapid, detailed information about pupil understanding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Formative assessment practices can provide valuable information about what

<h3>Presenter introduction</h3>
Teachers spend lots of time gathering information about pupil learning. They gather
information when they ask questions, circulate as pupils work and when they mark
their work. In order to make the most of this information, it is important that teachers
pause to examine what the information may tell them. By making inferences from formative
assessment, teachers are likely to make better decisions about their teaching.
<h3>Expert insight</h3>
Making inferences from formative assessment is about drawing tentative conclusions
about what pupils do or do not understand so that teachers can decide what to do
next. Tentative language is important here. It is almost impossible to identify with
real certainty what pupils are thinking and what they know. Any information that
teachers get from a formative assessment will only provide them with a momentary
snapshot of thinking. It won’t be the whole picture. And yet, it's still valuable
information that can give teachers a good indication of how learning is going, especially
when it comes to identifying misconceptions. While we need to be careful about the
conclusions that we draw, teachers still need to examine and use the information
that they gain from formative assessment.

For teachers to examine pupil responses, they need to have gathered some data first. Some of the ways in which teachers might do this include observing pupils work when circulating the classroom, asking a series of questions or asking pupils to complete an exit task. An exit task is a short task that pupils complete at the end of the lesson. These tasks should be focused on the key learning of the lesson or the identification of common misconceptions and be relatively quick to complete and assess.

Once data has been gathered, teachers need to think about what they can infer from it. There are a number of questions that teachers can ask themselves to help them examine and interpret the information. Here are some useful questions to ask when pupils have made a mistake. 1) How many pupils have made the mistake? 2) What is the error? 3) What might the source of the error be? For example, is it the result of a gap in understanding or is it a misconception? The answers to these questions will determine how teachers decide to respond. For example, teachers may infer that lots of their pupils hold a common misconception and decide to pause the lesson to address it. Or they may infer that lots of their pupils have a significant gap in understanding and that it would be worth re-teaching the relevant content in a subsequent lesson.

One of the challenges that teaches face when examining pupil responses is that they have huge amount of information to consider and it can take a long time to do this. One way in which teachers can avoid making their workload unmanageable is to prioritise their time by looking for knowledge or understanding of the most important ideas. It is equally important to bear in mind the most common misconceptions when examining pupil work. Knowing what knowledge and misconceptions you are looking for in advance will make it easier for you to spot when you come across it.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see Ambition Institute coach Fran Denley model how
to examine a set of pupil responses to an exit task. As you watch, pay attention
to how Fran does the following:
<ul>
  <li>Is aware of common misconceptions</li>
  <li>
    Draws conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of
    performance over a number of assessments.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
For the purpose of this model, I want you to imagine that I have just taught my
Year Six class a lesson on adding fractions with different denominators. At the
planning stage, I spoke to a colleague who has taught this content effectively
on many occasions and she helped me to identify a number of common mistakes that
pupils make. I designed an exit task for pupils to complete at the end of the
lesson to see if any of them had made these mistakes. Here are the most common
errors that I decided to check for:
<ul>
  <li>
    Pupils have taken the largest number instead of identifying a common
    denominator.
  </li>
  <li>Pupils have added the numerator and denominator separately.</li>
  <li>Pupils have not simplified the fraction.</li>
</ul>
Here are all of the exit tasks from the class. The first thing that I do is to
scan them quickly to see which pupils have got the answer correct and which ones
have got it wrong. I have written down the correct answer here to help me do
this more quickly. I’ve divided the exit tasks into two piles. I am going to
concentrate on this pile of incorrect answers.

The next step is to dig into these incorrect answers. I want to see which errors pupils have made. Again, the fact that I have thought about these misconceptions in advance really speeds this process up.

I have now identified that the majority of pupils have gone wrong because they have forgotten to simplify the fraction. A few of them have not found the common denominator.

Finally, I need to decide what to do next. I’m going to draw on information that I have from exit tasks along with what I know about my pupils and the scheme of work. I am going to prioritise re-teaching how to simplify a fraction at the beginning of our next lesson. Quite a few pupils have got this wrong so it is worthwhile re-teaching and since this is a really important process to get right, it won’t harm the pupils who have the correct answer to give it another go. I’m going to hold off addressing the error of not identifying the common denominator. I first taught this to the class a few lessons ago and lots more of them got it wrong than have today so it looks like the majority are getting the hang of this. Also, I know that we will be coming back to this later on in the scheme of work so I will have another opportunity to address it then.

<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
There are a couple of key points to draw out from this short example.

First, Fran had identified in advance which misconceptions she wanted to test for. This made it much easier for Fran to spot them when interpreting the exit tasks. It should also make her inferences more accurate because each question on the exit task targeted one misconception, helping Fran to identify a precise problem.

Second, when scanning information in the exit tasks, Fran looked for patterns. She identified a pattern of pupils who had made particular errors and she also considered patterns of performance when she compared pupils’ responses on this exit task to previous performance on the topic. Looking back at past performance provided Fran with more information with which to draw an inference: in this case that the majority of pupils seem to be improving their understanding of simplifying fractions.

Overall, Fran was able to come to a number of likely conclusions fairly quickly and adapt her teaching in response. This was time well spent.

<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
In this video, we have considered the importance of making inferences from formative
assessment and some of the ways in which teachers can do this. Before we finish,
read the key ideas that the video has covered. Which ideas do you feel that the example
illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced
    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitoring pupils’ work during lessons, including checking for
    misconceptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of
    performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments
    draw inferences about learning from performance).
  </li>
</ul>
Drawing inferences from formative assessment can feel easier the more that teachers
know their subject and pupils. When teaching something new for the first time, it
is a really good idea to work with an experienced teacher when reviewing pupil assessments.
This can help teachers to make better decisions for their pupils, and ultimately
improve learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones is designing and using assessments frequently to check pupil understanding and misconceptions. However, he finds the amount of information they provide challenging to manage, particularly with so many pupil responses. He must decide what to do next rapidly, either during the lesson, or before the next. Doing this slowly during a lesson risks losing pupils’ attention; doing this slowly after the lesson adds to his workload dramatically. How can he use the information available to identify rapidly what pupils have understood, their misconceptions and their knowledge gaps?

## Key idea

Teachers need a simple, systematic approach to decide how to respond to pupils’ knowledge gaps and misconceptions.

## Evidence summary

### Identifying critical knowledge gaps and misconceptions

When faced with an array of pupil responses, Mr Jones must be able to identify the crucial points rapidly. Since his goal is to develop pupils’ mental models, his focus must be on what pupils are thinking, not just on whether they have got the correct answer. Understanding pupils’ thinking allows teachers to recognise the strengths and gaps in their mental models, and to plan ways to respond (Wiliam, 2011). Mr Jones can do this best by taking a systematic approach. Teachers can use their knowledge of likely misconceptions and knowledge gaps (Ball et al., 2010) to design tasks which will reveal them. Similarly, they can analyse assessments with the most likely misconceptions and knowledge gaps in mind. Mr Jones’ previous work with colleagues, breaking learning down, specifying goals, sequencing ideas and identifying misconceptions should allow him to look for evidence of their knowledge and understanding of the most fundamental and important ideas.

### Deciding on next steps

In reviewing pupils’ work, Mr Jones must decide whether to revisit an idea or to move on. His decision will reflect the importance of the idea: if a pupil misconception is core to understanding the subject, or to understanding the current topic, it is worth reviewing immediately. If a misconception is peripheral to the subject or the topic, it may not be a priority (Wiliam, 2011). Mr Jones may also be influenced by the prevalence of the misconception or knowledge gap: the more pupils who hold it, the more important it is to address.

Having identified the prevalence and importance of the knowledge gap or misconception, he can choose how to adapt his teaching and/or how to provide feedback to pupils. For example, if an assessment activity shows him that a handful of pupils have retained a misconception from a previous unit, he may defer addressing it since it is not foundational to the subject or the current unit. Conversely, if pupils have a fundamental misconception, or many pupils have the same knowledge gap, he may offer a fresh explanation, a new learning task and then reassess pupils’ understanding. His mental model of the subject and his sense of pupils’ developing mental models should allow him to prioritise the most crucial barriers to their understanding, drawing on the support of colleagues and resources where necessary.

### Learning and performance are distinct

Learning and performance are different things. Performance is a temporary change in behaviour or knowledge which can be measured immediately after acquisition; learning is a lasting change in behaviour or knowledge (Christodoulou, 2017). Pupils’ responses during or after a lesson that introduced new information are an indication of their performance, not of their learning. For example, pupils may answer correctly initially but subsequently forget new information. In analysing pupils’ responses, Mr Jones prioritises using them to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions, rather than seeing them as a guarantee that pupils will recall key ideas: his plans to revisit key ideas will check and support pupils’ subsequent retention.

### Nuances and caveats

Whatever the process Mr Jones follows, it must be quick. Within a lesson, the process could take a few seconds; after the lesson, he needs to have enough time having examined pupil responses to plan a next step. Equally, it is difficult for teachers new to an idea to identify misconceptions or gaps in pupils’ mental models immediately. Mr Jones may usefully review assessments and decide on next steps in collaboration with his mentor or a more experienced teacher. They can help him decide best what to do next and can model their approach to reviewing assessments.

$I

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
Mr Jones can reach conclusions about next steps from formative assessment if he:
<ul>
  <li>Takes a systematic approach to identify patterns of understanding.</li>
  <li>
    Tries to understand pupils’ thinking by seeking common misconceptions and
    knowledge gaps, rather than just looking for the correct answer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Judges the prevalence and importance of misconceptions and knowledge gaps
    when deciding whether and how to adapt his teaching.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Presenter introduction</h3>
Really effective teachers are fascinated by how pupil learning is going. They ask
lots of questions, both during and after the lesson, to identify how knowledge is
taking shape. But as well as asking questions, effective teachers do something with
the information that they gather. Great teachers adapt their teaching in response
to what they find out. Adapting teaching helps teachers to provide targeted support
and is likely to increase pupil success.
<h3>Expert insight</h3>
Adapting lessons to meet pupils’ needs is about drawing on analysis of information
from formative assessments to make better decisions. Learning is a complex process
and pupils need lots of support along the way, such as more practice or opportunities
to correct misconceptions. Pupils learn more when their teachers know what they have
understood and adapt their teaching in response.

In order to adapt lessons to meet their pupils’ needs, teachers first need to understand what those needs are. This occurs through effective design and delivery of formative assessment - looking out for particular misconceptions as they circulate, asking carefully targeted questions, and examining their pupils’ work.

Once teachers have useful data, there are several ways they can use it. One way is through using whole-class or group feedback. This allows for teachers to address common errors or misconceptions for multiple students. Another way teachers might adapt lessons to meet their pupils’ needs is through further support. This might be done through greater scaffolding and additional practice.

Sometimes a teacher might make the decision to adapt teaching over time. Teachers might plan time into future lessons to respond to common misconceptions or errors. Depending on how important the concept is, a teacher might use the start of a lesson, or in some instances, whole lessons to explain or re-teach concepts to pupils.

Pupils’ needs will differ across the class and it can be tough to balance the needs of the whole class and the needs of individuals when adapting teaching. It is important that teachers continue to support pupils individually. This can be done through one-on-one conversations, working effectively with teaching assistants and working closely with the special education needs co-ordinator in their school. Many pupils will have preferences about how they learn. However, the idea that tailoring teaching to pupils’ preferred learning style will benefit them is not supported by evidence.

Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and require different support from their teachers in order to succeed. Carefully planning lessons in advance to help pupils to access and remember what they learn is essential, but teachers can’t always predict what will happen when they teach something. Seeking to understand the differences in pupil learning and responding appropriately is a key part of teaching. This is what adapting teaching is all about. At its best, adapting teaching can ensure teachers target support effectively, both for individuals and groups.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see Ambition Institute coach Rosie Clark plan how to
adapt a lesson in response to formative assessment information. As you watch, pay
particular attention to how Rosie does the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Considers carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and
    small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different
    lessons for different groups of pupils.
  </li>
  <li>Builds in additional practice or removes unnecessary expositions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
In this example, imagine that I am teaching a reception class how to form the
lower-case letter M. Prior to the lesson, I am going to spend a short amount of
time thinking about what misconceptions I might encounter and planning how I
will respond.

“First, I need to remind myself what misconceptions I am likely to encounter. I thought about it this when planning the lesson and when designing a formative assessment, so I’m able to do this fairly quickly now. These are the misconceptions I anticipate:

[Participant reads on screen]

<ul>
  <li>Holding the pencil incorrectly</li>
  <li>Starting at the bottom of the line instead of the top</li>
  <li>Doing the curves different heights</li>
</ul>
Next, I need to consider who is likely to hold this misconception and how important
is it. Specifically, I need to ask, do I think one pupil will hold this misconception
or the whole class? Will this misconception get in the way of learning now or can
I address it later? The answer I give here will determine my next step.

Finally, I need to think about how I might adapt the lesson if the misconception arises. I have several options that I can chose from, including breaking the content down for pupils further, re-teaching something that they have got wrong or coming back to the content in another lesson. All of these options could work for either a whole class, a small group or an individual. Let’s look at my list of misconceptions one by one:

[Read on screen]

<ul>
  <li>Holding the pencil incorrectly</li>
</ul>
Most of my pupils are now very good at holding the pencil correctly, but one or two
are still holding it too high up. This will make it much harder for them to complete
this task accurately. I’m going to pay particular attention to this when I circulate
during the independent practice task and if pupils are making this mistake, I am
going to stop them and show them how to hold the pencil. It isn’t something that
I intend to address with the whole class.

[Read on screen]

<ul>
  <li>Starting at the bottom of the line</li>
</ul>
Again, I think that this is likely to be a common mistake, based on what I have seen
elsewhere. It matters a lot because it will make their letter formation much less
accurate, so I do need to address it if it arises. This is the first time that pupils
have attempted this task and I want them to get this right. Again, I will look for
this misconception when I circulate during independent practice. If I need to, I
will break this content down further by telling pupils to 1) identify the two lines
on the page and 2) place their pencils in the middle and then draw the line down.

[Participant reads]

<ul>
  <li>Doing the curves different heights</li>
</ul>
I think it’s likely that a lot of the pupils will make this mistake. However, at
this stage of their learning, as long as the heights are not vastly different heights,
it isn’t going to stop them from developing accuracy. They may well be accurate elsewhere
in their letter formation and I know that will improve over time. I’m only going
to address this if none of the other misconceptions arise, in which case, I will
model this aspect of the letter formation again.
<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>
There are several important ideas to highlight in this model.

First, the coach considers carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils. Throughout the model, she repeatedly considers how significant the misconception is and which pupils are likely to hold the misconception. For example, Rosie anticipates that only a few pupils will hold their pencils incorrectly.

Therefore, she plans to respond through a one-to-one conversation with these pupils. Whereas if Rosie spots that lots of pupils begin their letter formation at the wrong point on the line, she plans to pause and quickly remodel this bit because this is an important thing for all pupils to get right. In planning her response to this particular misconception, Rosie also considered what additional practice might look like, in this case breaking it down further by giving pupils a strategy for finding the correct place to start.

By anticipating and planning her response in advance, Rosie will be able to adapt more effectively in the moment. She knows which problems to address immediately, and which ones to pick up in a subsequent lesson.

<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
In this video, we have considered the importance of adapting lessons to meet pupil
needs and some of the ways in which teachers might do this. Before we finish, read
the key ideas that the video has covered. Which of the following ideas do you feel
that the example illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Adapting lessons, while maintaining high expectations for all, so that all
    pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Considering carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals
    and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning
    different lessons for different groups of pupils.
  </li>
  <li>Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions.</li>
</ul>
There are no perfect solutions when it comes to adapting teaching. But when teachers
adapt their teaching effectively, it helps them to target their teaching better so
that it addresses what pupils do and not understand. If we do this well enough, pupil
learning increases. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones is using formative assessment regularly and becoming increasingly skilled in analysing what he learns from it. He is confident he can identify the knowledge gaps and misconceptions pupils face. However, he is uncertain how best to adapt lessons to meet pupils’ needs. Should he create tailored activities and resources for individual pupils? How can he meet pupils’ individual needs efficiently?

## Key idea

Teachers can use information about pupil understanding and needs to target support at the whole class, groups and individuals.

## Evidence summary

### Using information from assessments to adapt lessons

Mr Jones designs assessment tasks and analyses the information they provide to allow him to adapt his teaching to meet pupils’ needs. When teachers know what their pupils have understood, and use this information to adapt their teaching, pupils’ achievement increases (Speckesser et al., 2018). Mr Jones should also collect information about pupils needs and possible strategies, particularly for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, by working closely with colleagues including the SENCO, families and pupils. However, using information on pupil needs to adapt teaching is challenging as it requires teachers to decide how to respond rapidly and there are no perfect solutions. Pupils learn at different rates and require different levels of support. In any class, when seeking to understand pupil differences including levels of prior knowledge and barriers to learning, at any one time some pupils will be ready to move on and others may need further support.

### Learning styles and individualisation will not be effective or sustainable

Mr Jones could design a different lesson or task for every pupil, but this would be a mistake. Pupils have distinct learning preferences: some prefer to read, some would rather listen, some might prefer group activities. Mr Jones could try to create distinct activities for different groups. However, no evidence exists that tailoring learning to pupils’ preferred learning styles is effective (Pashler, et al., 2008). The authors of this study were adamant that “limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number” (Pashler, et al., 2008, p.105).

Similarly, Mr Jones might try to design individual activities around individual pupils’ current knowledge gaps or misconceptions. The problem with this approach is that it requires Mr Jones to spend a huge amount of time planning and setting out activities for individual pupils. It also robs individual pupils of the chance to benefit from the teacher’s expertise by forcing them to overcome their knowledge gaps and misconceptions individually (Sadler, 2010). Mr Jones is more likely to be successful if he prioritises designing tasks to support the whole class or groups within it first. Once the majority are experiencing success, he can then responsively support groups and individuals during the lesson where this is feasible.

### Common tasks and flexible grouping

Mr Jones can best meet the needs of individuals by identifying the needs which several pupils have in common. Mr Jones should still build relationships with individuals and seeks to support them with specific individual needs, such as seating visually impaired pupils at the front of the class and providing large print resources or providing a story about dinosaurs if he knows this will be particularly motivating for pupils who usually struggle to focus. However, many pupil needs are shared by the rest of the class: many misconceptions are common to pupils learning specific subjects so he can address them simultaneously.

For example, many pupils use apostrophes unnecessarily for words ending in a plural ‘s’, add the numerators and denominators separately when adding fractions and believe that air tubes distribute air around the body. Likewise, Mr Jones is likely to find knowledge gaps which are shared among many pupils since they are based on not having been introduced to (or not recalling) past content. While Mr Jones can look for opportunities to work with misconceptions or knowledge gaps held by all pupils, if one individual pupil has a specific need, he can dedicate individual time to them.

Having identified the need of several pupils, Mr Jones may decide to:

- **Work with the whole class:** Planning new explanations and additional learning tasks for the whole class. This gives him the opportunity to reiterate key ideas and give all pupils additional practice.
- **Group pupils:** Putting pupils together into small groups based on shared need. For example, all pupils who got question seven wrong or who missed the last lesson. This kind of within-class grouping tends to prove effective and to benefit pupils at all levels (Steenbergen-Hu, et al., 2016). It enables groups of pupils to benefit from more of Mr Jones’s time and expertise as he can explain a misconception or overcome a knowledge gap with all pupils who hold it at once. This also makes it a more efficient way for him to use his time. If an individual pupil has a specific need perhaps linked to special educational needs or a disability, Mr Jones can devote additional time to them: his grouping of other pupils increases the time he can spend with the individuals who need it most.

### Nuances and caveats

In adapting lessons – and particularly when working with small groups with specific misconceptions – Mr Jones should continue to convey his high expectations of pupils (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018).

Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to need additional levels of support. Mr Jones should seek specific strategies to support these pupils with specific learning barriers where appropriate, such that they can meet these high expectations e.g. sitting a visually impaired pupil at the front of the class and providing large print resources so that they can complete common class tasks successfully.

Teaching assistants can provide further support but they need to be prepared for the lesson by the teacher and used to supplement, rather than replace, the teacher (EEF, 2018). For example, the TA could support pupils to successfully correct the apostrophes in their work after the teacher has explained correct usage.

An ongoing dilemma for Mr Jones will be when to review a topic and when to carry on. His work identifying the most important core ideas within a subject and a topic should make it easier for him to prioritise this.

Another dilemma for Mr Jones is whether to give pupils feedback. As pupils benefit from accessing material several times to learn it (Pashler et al, 2007; Dunlosky et al., 2013), it will often be more efficient to use strategies like modelling content, not least as written feedback adds to teacher workload leading to learning gains, especially if it is not acted upon (Gibson et al, 2015; EEF, 2016).

<h3>Presenter introduction</h3>
Providing feedback to pupils can have a positive impact on learning. But it can be
hard to get feedback right. Teachers need to think carefully about what feedback
they will provide and why, including feedback that develops pupils’ understanding
of their subject as well as how to improve on a specific task.
<h3>Expert insight</h3>
Effective feedback focuses on how pupils can improve. It provides them with clear
guidance on what they can do to develop their knowledge and understanding of a subject.
Ultimately, we want pupils to be successful without the support of a teacher. We
want feedback to help pupils go from dependence to independence. But this can be
hard to achieve.

When thinking about feedback, it is helpful to consider how you will design and deliver feedback.

Feedback should be designed so that it is specific. Feedback needs to focus on specific actions that pupils can understand and use. Specific feedback can also be more manageable for both pupils and teachers. Lengthy, written feedback can be difficult for pupils to read. It also takes teachers a lot of time to create. Designing feedback that is short and precise can be better for both pupils and teachers.

Feedback also needs to be useable and support pupils to improve in future learning. It is a good idea to design feedback that is linked to both the specific task in hand and a more general concept that pupils will encounter on a different task.

A lot of the feedback that teachers give will be specific to a task. For example, they may say “you need to rewrite your answer to question 3, remove the brackets by multiplying by 2.” This will help pupils to address a specific mistake in a specific task, but they might not remember to apply this feedback the next time that they are simplifying equations. Transfer from one context to another is hard, even where the problems are very similar. On the other hand, a teacher might give more general feedback like, “remember to write formally in business letters.” This is a strategy that they can apply beyond this task, however it might not tell them which specific error they need to correct, such as removing abbreviations like it’s. Therefore, feedback that combines a specific action that they can apply to the task in hand along with a more general approach that they can apply to similar types of problems can help.

In order to design feedback that is both specific and general, teachers can ask themselves a number of key questions. 1) What is the specific mistake that pupils have made on this task? 2) What underlying concept is this mistake linked to? 3) Can I design feedback that identifies both the specific task and the underlying concept and provide feedback linked to both?

An example of this might be where pupils have made a mistake when using the column method for subtraction. Take a look at this example of a pupil’s work:

[ECT reads on screen]

The specific mistake is that the pupil has subtracted 5 from 0. They have forgotten to carry over the 1 from the next column. An underlying concept could either be knowing how to use the column method for subtraction or understanding that commutative property cannot apply to subtraction. Commutative property states that it doesn’t matter which order you add numbers up in. But this isn’t true when subtracting numbers. Depending on what decision the teacher makes, they might provide whole class feedback in the next lesson that look like this:

“Remember that when using the column method, you can borrow numbers from the left column: borrow the 1 from the left to make 10” or

“Remember that the order in which we subtract numbers matters: borrow the 1 from the left so that you can do this more easily.”

In both cases, the feedback identifies both the specific task and its underlying concept and combines feedback that will help them to improve on this task as well as other similar problems. Ideally, when they are using the column method for subtraction in the future, they will recognise the underlying concept and remember the more general feedback about the column method or commutative property. This should help them to solve the problem on their own.

There may, of course, be times when specific, direct feedback that focuses solely on the task in hand is appropriate. This will depend on the content and the learner. For example, when pupils are in the early stages of learning about the column subtraction method, it is useful to focus feedback on this specific strategy first. Pupils will need to know the specific, concrete steps for this method first before teachers start to link it to more abstract principles, such a commutative property.

Another way of designing useable feedback, is to design feedback that help pupils to self-regulate their own learning. We want pupils to be able to use the feedback that we give on their own. Teachers can design feedback that supports self-regulation of learning by connecting it to the strategy of plan, monitor and evaluate. For example, a teacher might revisit the plan stage by showing them what good looks like: going through a good example of the column method again, drawing attention to the importance of borrowing 1 from the left. The teacher could then recall the monitor and evaluate stages by comparing this example to the pupil’s work, highlighting where they went wrong and identifying the steps they need to take to improve their work. Giving pupils the opportunity to see a good example as an end goal and compare their work to it may help them to plan, monitor and evaluate when they work on their own.

In terms of delivering feedback, it’s important to be aware that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors. Feedback needs to feel encouraging. Teachers can help to ensure that feedback will be received well by ensuring that they have solid foundations in place: a positive learning environment and culture of mutual trust and respect between pupils and teachers. It also helps to explain why feedback is being given, reminding pupils that the purpose is to help them to achieve ambitious learning goals. Effective feedback can help pupils get better and should feel encouraging as a result. Equally, focusing on the work itself rather than pupils’ personal strengths and weaknesses can make pupils more receptive to feedback and more likely to act on it. Instead of saying something like, “you’re normally great at writing, what’s going on here?”, more specific feedback about the work would be more useful: “Before you write a sentence down, practice saying it in your head first.”

With a better understanding of where pupils have gone wrong and why, and what feedback will help them to improve, you can go back and refine your approach to how you might deliver that feedback. Whether that means a quick correction, re-teaching, more time to practice or, perhaps, a combination of all three.

<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>
In the next example, you will see Ambition Institute coach Steve Farndon model a
process for deciding what he will give feedback on. As you watch, focus on how Steve
does the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Prioritises the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather
    than careless mistakes when marking.
  </li>
  <li>Focuses on specific actions for pupils.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exemplification</h3>
For the purpose of this model, I want you to imagine that I am an English
teacher. My Year 8 class are learning how to write business letters. They’ve
just written a letter to an employer, which came at the end of a sequence of
learning. I’ve sampled a good range of these letters and have noticed a few
errors that lots of my pupils have made. One particularly common error is the
use of apostrophes for abbreviation. Lots of pupils have written it’s instead of
it is. Abbreviations are not appropriate for writing business letters so I want
them to correct it. But I want to make sure that my feedback helps them to
improve on this task and a similar upcoming task. I’m going to go through a
number of steps.

1. What is the problem: lots of my pupils are using an apostrophe to abbreviate it is to it’s. They shouldn’t be doing this on this task.

2. What is an underlying concept: business letters are formal.

3. What specific feedback can I give to address the error on this task: check for abbreviations.

4. What feedback can I give about the underlying concept: write formally.

Combining all of this together, my feedback will be:

Remember to write formally in business letters: check your use of abbreviations.

I hope that the next time my pupils come to write a business letter, they will remember that they should write formally which may then prompt them to check their use of abbreviations.

I want to draw your attention to a few points in this model.

First, I prioritised my feedback on an important misunderstanding – how abbreviations make writing sound less formal. Pupils had made other errors too, like spelling errors, but I have a strategy in place that will support pupils to correct these themselves. I want to make sure that the feedback that I am providing to the whole class will help the majority of my pupils improve their work. This helps me to make the best use of my time and theirs.

Second, I designed my feedback carefully so that it focused on specific actions. As well as this, by linking the feedback to an underlying concept I was drawing attention to the underlying structure of the problem: in this case, how to sound formal when writing a business letter. This should help my pupils to correct their own work when they do similar tasks in the future.

Finally, I designed my feedback so that it was delivered verbally. This saves me lots of time as I am not writing individual comments on pupils’ work and during the lesson, I will be able to check that pupils understand the feedback.

This is one specific model and if you are not an English teacher, it may feel difficult to see how it links to your subject. To help you, focus on the key principles that are relevant to all subjects and phases:

<ul>
  <li>
    Prioritise the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather
    than careless mistakes when marking
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for pupils to respond
    to feedback.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Presenter summary</h3>
In this video, we have considered the impact that effective feedback can have as
well as some ideas about what to include in feedback. Before you finish, take a
moment to read over the key ideas of the video. Which ideas do you think the
model illustrated the best?
<ul>
  <li>
    Prioritise the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather
    than careless mistakes when marking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for them to respond to
    feedback.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after
    lessons where possible.
  </li>
</ul>
Feedback is something that teachers are likely to improve on the more that they
know their subject and their pupils. When feedback is successful, pupils do
better academically and take increasing ownership over their learning both at
school and beyond. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Teaching challenge

Mr Jones assesses pupils’ work regularly and adapts his teaching in response to their needs. He wants to ensure that the feedback he offers pupils genuinely helps them to improve their work and deepen their understanding. He finds the variety of kinds of feedback available overwhelming and he worries that the amount of time it will take him to provide detailed feedback will be unsustainable in the long term.

## Key idea

Feedback can make a significant difference to pupils’ understanding and outcomes if it guides pupils to improve and is sustainable for the teacher.

## Evidence summary

### Effective feedback is specific, usable and encouraging

Mr Jones must ensure that his feedback offers pupils precise guidance about how they can improve. Often feedback focuses on the immediate task, but it is more helpful to link feedback about the immediate task to feedback about the subject or the process of learning. This ensures that pupils can apply it to future tasks (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Feedback should provide specific guidance in how pupils improve their work: lengthy, complicated and excessively detailed feedback can be overwhelming to pupils and therefore counter-productive since they may be unable to act upon it (DFE, 2016).

Ensuring pupils respond to feedback is as important as the content of the feedback (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Feedback may be ineffective if pupils find it discouraging or conclude that they are unable to act upon it (Wiliam, 2011). For example, pupils’ responses to feedback can also vary depending on a range of social factors, including their age as well as the message the feedback contains. Realising this, Mr Jones needs to frame feedback in such a way as to ensure that pupils seek and welcome it, for example identifying specific strengths and encouraging pupils to keep up their effort in relation to these. Moreover, feedback should focus on improving pupils’ work, for example “remember to write formally in business letters: check and remove any abbreviations in formal writing”. In contrast, if it focuses on pupils’ personal strengths and weaknesses (“you’re usually good at writing letters”), this can lead them to worry more about how they are perceived by others than about how they can improve (Hattie and Timperley, 2007). He also needs to give them time and opportunities to act upon formative feedback, for example in the lesson after written feedback has been given.

Given the importance of these elements of feedback, Mr Jones realises he will need to be careful about his use of peer and self-generated feedback. If these strategies are to be effective, they need to meet the same criteria as any other feedback: offer specific guidance and encourage further effort. If they do not, they are likely to be ineffective.

In summary, feedback should:

- Be specific.
- Focus on immediate and subsequent improvements in work and effort.
- Encourage pupils to act upon it.

### Feedback needs to be sustainable for teachers

Mr Jones worries that providing detailed feedback could easily come to take up a huge amount of his time. He is reassured to learn that there is no specific evidence supporting the provision of extensive written feedback and very limited evidence about the effectiveness of written marking as a specific means of providing feedback (Gibson et al., 2015). Within the limits of his school’s marking and feedback policy, this frees him to provide the guidance that pupils need in the most efficient manner possible. He could work with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to feedback, for example, by giving pupils feedback through a model, through a verbal comment, or by providing feedback to the whole class. He should only record data from feedback when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes.

### Feedback and self-regulation

Feedback can help pupils to take a greater role in their learning. Feedback allows pupils to better plan, monitor and evaluate their current performance and understanding. If pupils have a good grasp of their current performance and a clear sense of their goal, then they should increasingly be able to judge how well they are doing and regulate their learning by identifying what they need to do to improve.

Teachers can help by explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge. For example, helping pupils to effectively plan, monitor and evaluate their writing through sharing what an effective final piece of writing looks like and modelling the thinking and steps undertaken to produce it. Teachers can then facilitate feedback on how effectively pupils have planned, monitored and evaluated their work: “You missed out step two in the plan. Make sure you select three pieces of evidence you are going to use in your essay”. This feedback develops pupil metacognition in relation to this particular task. These strategies can develop pupil independence and academic success (EEF, 2017).

### Nuances and caveats

Not all feedback is effective. Additional feedback may not support pupils to improve further: the crucial question when considering whether feedback is effective is whether it leads to the desired improvement. It is not about the quantity offered or the way it is delivered.

Feedback is just one way to help pupils improve: the priority is to teach effectively initially then to use feedback where pupils have struggled, rather than relying on feedback (Hattie and Timperley, 2007).

The evidence on feedback is sometimes inconclusive and even contradictory (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996). Mr Jones will need to adapt the guidance on effective feedback to suit the subject he is teaching and the needs of his class. It could be useful to speak to colleagues who teach the same subject about such adaptions.

This page describes the structure of the programme and explains how you can make the most of your study.

## Programme structure

The programme is composed of three **strands**. A strand is the sequenced content that a newly qualified teacher will work through over the period of roughly a term. Each strand has a core focus: mainly **Behaviour**, **Instruction**, or **Subject**. Each strand includes relevant aspects of other strands as well as important ideas and practice about teacher self-regulation.

Each strand is composed of 12 **modules**: one overview module and eleven core modules. These are designed to be worked through on a weekly rhythm. Each module has three associated **development areas**. Teacher improvement works best when it is focused on changing one aspect of practice at a time -- participants work on a maximum of one development area per week as part of the coaching process. To ensure lasting changes in practice, teachers remain on a strand for the duration of the term. This ensures that teachers have the necessary time to practice and habitualise changes to their classroom practice.

## **Making the most of your study**

This programme provides resources to help you work through Early Career Framework (ECF) content independently. This aspect of the programme is called ‘study’. This includes:

- 10 minutes to **watch** a video that zooms into an aspect of the ECF, unpacks some of the key ideas around it, and shows you what it looks like in practice.
- 15 minutes to **read** and think about a summary of the evidence around the same area of the ECF.
- 15 minutes to **check** your understanding using a quiz and reflect on your current practice.

Watching videos are a great way to see what good looks like in practice and consider how you might apply the ideas from the module to your own teaching. To have the best chance of impacting your teaching, when watching the videos, it is useful to have a clear focus in mind and watch them when you can concentrate fully. This might entail you finding a quiet space for productive study so you can watch and think carefully about what you are seeing and hearing.

Reading is an effective way to dig deeper into the evidence and think about what this might mean for your practice. We have attempted to pull together all the most relevant evidence into a concise ‘evidence summary’. Again, finding a weekly slot to read and think where you’ll be free from interruptions and distractions will be key to your success on the programme.

After reading, it is important to check your understanding and reflect on your learning. The quizzes provided are ‘low stakes’ - your performance on them won’t impact you in any way (other than consolidating your learning). They are intended to help you check if you’ve understood key ideas from the reading and should help to clarify misconceptions that you might have. You can use them to strategically re-read, to reflect, or simply to consider questions you might want to pick up with your mentor.
