This programme harnesses the Early Career Framework (ECF) to help NQTs develop their teaching during the first few years of their career.\n\nWe have drawn on the best available evidence around how professionals learn to create a programme that will not only have a lasting impact on NQT knowledge and practice, but will do so whilst respecting the busy and demanding working lives of teachers.\n\nWe believe that effective teaching is one of the biggest levers we have for improving the experiences, outcomes and life chances of the pupils in our care. It is a privilege to support you on your journey to keep getting better.\n\n{button}[Read the introduction](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/ambition-institute/introduction/){/button}\n\n{button secondary}[Download all teacher materials](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_TextbookDigital_Teachers_v3-compressed.pdf){/button}\n\nFor guidance on using these materials, see the [ECF Teacher Handbook (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Ambition-EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_Guidebook_FULL_DEV.pdf).\n\n## The strands\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nBehaviour\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<a href=\"http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/ambition-institute/self-directed-study-materials/1-behaviour/1-strand-fundamentals-and-contracting/\">\n  B1.

Each Block has been designed based on international best practice of effective professional development, and includes interactive self-study materials that explain the research behind the Early Career Framework and give exemplifications of what this looks like in the classroom. There is also protected time in Year 1 as part of these materials to observe colleagues and to be observed.\n\nEach Block provides ECTs with the time to:\n\n- **Learn** the content from the Early Career Framework\n- Put the learning into **practice** with suggestions for classroom practice\n- **Reflect** on their professional and personal development.\n\nFor more information on the programme structure and suggestions on well-being and workload, see the [Overview of the Core Induction Programme (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Overview-of-EDTs-Core-Induction-Programme.pdf)\n\n## Year 1\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nOverview\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nYear 1 is an introduction to the key themes and statements in the Early Career Framework. The focus is on helping Early Career Teachers (ECTs) to establish themselves in the classroom, drawing on the best international evidence for what works in education. ECTs will work on core principles and techniques of effective teaching, including lesson planning, expositions, assessment, feedback and managing behaviour. Throughout each Block (module) they will find practical, accessible self-study activities to support their development. These will be further supplemented by regular sessions with their Mentor and training sessions led by an expert practitioner. These sessions are designed to support ECTs to translate the research into their classroom, with opportunities to discuss research, observe colleagues, practise new techniques and reflect on their

During Year 2, the focus is on mastering key ideas in the Early Career Framework. ECTs will be encouraged to reflect on the links between themes, in the light of their increasing knowledge and developing practice. They will continue to work with their Mentor to reflect on the progress they have made, and by the end of the year they will identify future opportunities for development or specialisation for the next stage of their career.

Pupils seem to like\nthem, to work hard in their lessons. Perhaps you can remember a favorite teacher\nwho neither you nor your classmates would mess around for. It's tempting to think\nthat this is down to individual character traits, that good behaviour management\nis just something that teachers can just do.  But in fact, helping pupils to behave\nin a way that will support them to learn is something that all teachers can learn\nto do well. As role models for pupils, we can have a big influence over how they\nbehave.\n<h3>Presenter: Nicholas Hickman</h3>\nBehaviour for learning involves putting things in place that will enable your pupils\nto think hard and try their best. Most effective behavior management strategies are\nproactive, rather than reactive. They involve advance planning. They require teachers\nto think about what they can do to shape behaviour for the better. To build an effective\nlearning environment, teachers need to establish and maintain strong routines and\nset high expectations for learning. We also need to teach pupils the specific behaviours\nthat support their learning. And to build strong relationships with pupils, teachers\nneed to behave in a way that is consistent and make an effort to get to know them.\nGet to know the school behaviour policy, greet pupils in the corridors, make positive\nphone calls home. All of these things build trust and show that teachers care. Good\nbehavior management doesn't happen by chance or by magic. It happens as a result\nof advance planning and implementing tried and tested strategies over and over again.\nThe results will be more than worth the effort.\n<h3>Presenter: Peps McCrea</h3>\nOver the course of the behaviour strand, we will help you learn how to shape your\npupils’ behaviour, so that enables them to get the best out of school and beyond.\nThe material's based on a growing body of evidence for both outside and inside the\nclassroom. In the first half of the strand, we'll show you ways of effectively managing\nbehavior. We'll show you the value of strong classroom routines, clear expectations,\nand trust. In the second half of the strand, we look at how to create a climate for\neffective learning by providing structured support, helping pupils to be more receptive\nto challenge, and supporting them to think hard.\n\nThe strand has been carefully sequenced so that it supports you across the term. At the beginning of the strand, we cover how to set up some of the key routines that you will want to have in place from day one. Towards the end of the strand, we'll explore practices that require more complex behaviour management, such as setting up effective group work. What you learn in the first half of the strand will support you in the second.\n\nEach video will provide you with an overview of the module, practical strategies, and the model of classroom practice to watch and unpick. The videos focus on techniques that you can apply in the classroom and draw on the same research base that is outlined in the evidence summary. We don't want you to just copy what you see in the videos. One example alone can never fit every context. What they can do, however, is give you a concrete example of some of the key ideas that you will learn. When you're watching, pay close attention to the ideas that we highlight. These ideas are transferable across all subjects, phases, and learners. The better you understand these core principles, the more you will be able to adapt what you see to your specific needs.\n\nOver the course of this strand, we want you to learn some practical ways in which you can manage classroom behaviour, as well as some of the theory that underpins these practices. You will come to see that managing behaviour isn't just about stopping disruption and getting pupils to comply. There's a lot more we can do to influence pupil thinking and motivation, which will ultimately help them to learn.\n\nWhen behaviour's going well, not only do pupils learn more, but it's a much more enjoyable experience for everyone.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B1.pdf){/button}\n\n## Read | Strand introduction\n\nWelcome to the _Behaviour_ strand of the programme. This strand is composed of 12 modules and has been designed to last roughly a term. It is best completed during your first term as an NQT – typically the autumn term.\n\nBy the end of this strand you will have an evidence-informed understanding of:\n\n- How to establish an effective learning environment.\n- How to effectively manage behaviour.\n- The importance of holding and promoting high expectations for all pupils.\n\nThis programme has been designed to ensure that teachers develop a holistic understanding of effective teaching so, while the _Behaviour_ strand is mostly about behaviour, it also incorporates insights from _Instruction_ and _Subject_.\n\nFurthermore, you’ll notice that as the strand progresses, modules will often touch on previously learned content. This is intentional and a crucial aspect of your learning experience. Some concepts on the programme are so important that they need to be revisited multiple times to ensure you develop a deep and durable understanding.\n\nThe strand comprises modules sequenced to first explore the process of establishing an effective learning environment, before considering how to promote behaviours that support effective learning.\n\n- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective behaviour management.\n- **Modules 2-5** cover the process of laying the foundations of an effective learning environment.\n- **Modules 6-7** cover the process of maintaining an effective learning environment over time.\n- **Modules 8-11** explore more complex ideas around certain practices that can support more effective learning, incorporating and building on previous modules.\n- **Module 12** explores how teachers continue to improve the learning environment over time.\n\n### Making it work\n\nThe features of effective learning environments can vary slightly depending on the subject(s), phase(s) or community you teach. In addition, there are some elements of the learning environment, like the school behaviour policy, that you will have limited control over. This is why it’s important that you work with subject and phase specialists in your school to help you identify the best ways to apply your learning. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to seek assistance and support (for example with challenging behaviour). Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context.\n\nThe evidence cited in the strand draws primarily from research on:\n\n- Classroom practices of effective teachers.\n- Cognitive science and educational psychology (for example, how pupils learn).\n- Evidence on effective educational approaches (both in the UK and internationally).\n\nYou might have previously come across some of the terminology explored, however some of the technical language used, particularly around cognitive science, may be new to you. Several key terms are explored further in the evidence summary below.\n\n### A reminder of the programme pattern\n\nEach module in the _Behaviour_ strand follows the pattern below:\n\n- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.\n- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.\n- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.\n- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.\n\nYear one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF.\n\nNow that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.\n\n## B1 | Strand overview\n\n### Teaching challenge\n\nMs Foden is starting a new year at school. She wants to create an effective learning environment for all of her pupils but worries that she may find it difficult to get some pupils to listen, work independently, or show sufficient respect in the classroom. What does an effective learning environment look like, and where should she start in building one?\n\n### Key idea\n\nCreating a predictable and secure classroom environment, managing pupil behaviour and holding high expectations all contribute to more successful learning.\n\n### Evidence summary\n\n#### The classroom environment and pupil learning\n\nEffective teaching entails improving pupil achievement, in terms of both academic outcomes as well as other outcomes that matter to their future and success (Coe et al., 2014). Improving pupil achievement means generating a lasting change to pupils’ capabilities or understanding. Pupil behaviour, the learning environment and how teachers manage these, all play a critical role in improving pupil learning.\n\nThe learning environment or classroom ‘climate’ is a result of multiple factors, such as (Coe et al., 2014):\n\n- Teacher expectations.\n- The relationships between teachers and pupils.\n- How the teacher manages the classroom.\n\nThere is strong evidence that certain teaching approaches lead to better pupil behaviour and create a more effective learning environment (IES, 2008).\n\nThe most effective learning environments are those that are predictable and secure, where pupils are responsive to the teacher (IES, 2008), and where pupils feel a sense of connection to their school, peers and teachers. Such classroom environments also contribute to a positive school culture (Chapman et al., 2013). Classroom environments like these are good for all pupils, but particularly those with special educational needs (Carroll et al., 2017).\n\nIn general, pupils are more alike than different in terms of how they think and learn (Willingham, 2009), so common approaches are likely to be effective in improving pupil behaviour. But this must be balanced with the need to match teaching and classroom management to individual pupil needs (IES, 2008). Providing additional support can be particularly beneficial to pupils with specific barriers to learning (Carroll et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition to improving pupil behaviour, over time effective learning environments can produce a range of important benefits, including:\n\n- **Pupil-teacher relationships:** Positive relationships and pupil perceptions of their teacher are based on repeated interactions over time (Wubbels et al., 2014). Being responsive to pupil needs, including considering and seeking to understand their feelings, can help build strong teacher-pupil relationships.\n- **Pupil attitudes to learning:** Pupil perceptions of school are shaped by teacher-pupil interactions and the goals, values and behaviours of classmates (Rathmann et al., 2018).\n- **Pupil wellbeing:** Pupils who perceive that their teachers are in control of the class and are able to include them in activities are also more likely to feel satisfied in life and have better school outcomes (Rathmann et al., 2018).\n- **Wider outcomes:** In addition to generating high academic outcomes for pupils, effective environments can also improve wider outcomes such as university entrance and graduation rates, higher wages, and lower chances of becoming pregnant as a teenager (Chetty et al., 2014).\n\n#### Effective behaviour management\n\nPart of creating an effective learning environment entails managing pupil behaviour. Effective behaviour management happens best when teachers anticipate challenging pupil behaviours and modify the classroom environment to prevent or mitigate them (IES, 2008). Behaviour management strategies typically fall into one of three categories:\n\n- **Proactive:** Approaches for pre-empting and preventing problem behaviours before they occur. For example, using seating plans.\n- **Reactive:** Strategies to deal effectively with classroom behaviours as they arise. For example, using rewards or sanctions.\n- **Escalation:** Where proactive and reactive strategies are failing to work after a time, or where behaviour is extremely disruptive or dangerous, teachers should follow the school behaviour policy and/or discuss with their mentor what further support can be put in place. For example, calling parents, setting detentions or sending pupils out of the class after a certain number of sanctions.\n\nPart of effective behaviour management involves setting clear rules and consistently reinforcing them (Coe et al., 2014; IES, 2008). The goal of these rules should be to create an environment where pupils are routinely successful (Coe et al., 2014). In the first half of the _Behaviour_ strand we explore a series of teacher approaches that establish an effective learning environment with good pupil behaviour. Evidence suggests that there are several specific ideas and practices that teachers can use to build an effective learning environment and manage pupil behaviour. These include:\n\n|                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Time on task           | While pupil behaviour is not a perfect indicator of whether pupils are learning (Coe, 2013), there is a significant relationship between the amount of time pupils spend on task and how much they learn (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Peer effects           | Pupil behaviour is influenced by that of their peers (IES, 2008). The more that individual pupils adopt on-task behaviours, the more likely it is that other pupils will follow them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Positive reinforcement | Positive reinforcement can create an effective learning environment. Positive reinforcement entails providing acknowledgement, praise and rewards for positive behaviours. However, teachers must be careful not to overuse praise, as this can inadvertently communicate low expectations (Coe et al., 2014). To avoid this, teachers can use ‘acknowledgement’ when expectations are merely met and reserve ‘praise’ for when they are exceeded. Sanctions for negative behaviours can also be used alongside positive reinforcement. Providing more praise than reprimand has been found to be most effective (IES, 2008).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Pupil success          | Ensuring a high pupil success rate is a powerful way to foster pupil behaviour and learning (Rosenshine, 2012). How Ms Foden communicates her expectations of pupil success can influence what they do and achieve. For example, if she inadvertently communicates low expectations of success, pupils can start to think that they can’t do it (Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010) and reduce the amount of effort they put in (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Conversely, pupils’ prior experiences of success at a specific, appropriately challenging task makes it more likely they will be motivated to persist at similar tasks in the future; this also makes it more likely they will be successful at such tasks (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Ms Foden should balance challenge with high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012)                                                                                                                             |\n| Motivation             | Pupil motivation can be intrinsic (driven by the task itself) or extrinsic (driven by rewards and sanctions). Pupils who are motivated intrinsically are more likely to stay on task longer and persist when learning gets challenging (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016). Over time, Ms Foden should aim to reduce extrinsic motivators and increase pupil intrinsic motivation. For example, helping pupils to master challenging content, and make links between their long-term goals and the work they are doing in school, can help pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, as well as pupil behaviour and academic success (EEF, 2018). Ms Foden should use opportunities like parents evening to communicate proactively and engage parents and carers in their children’s schooling. |\n| Self-regulation        | Self-regulation – the ability to steer our own behaviour and learning – is a strong predictor of attainment and future success. A key aspect of this is emotional regulation (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). This is important because negative pupil emotions can lead to pupils avoiding a task (Kluger & DeNisi 1996) and also because the ability to regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future life (EEF, 2017). Effective self-regulation also requires pupils to develop metacognitive strategies – how they plan, monitor and evaluate their approaches to specific tasks. Teacher support for pupil metacognition is likely to increase pupil self-regulation, success and therefore motivation (EEF, 2017).                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n#### Behaviour that fosters effective learning\n\nIn the second half of the _Behaviour_ strand, we will explore ways that teachers can foster effective learning. This part of the strand has lots of connections with the _Instruction_ strand. Evidence suggests that there are several specific ideas and practices that teachers can use to generate behaviours that further foster effective learning in the classroom. These include:\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Guided instruction | Pupils learn best when they build on what they already know, and when teachers guide them clearly and directly towards what they need to know – an approach sometimes referred to as ‘explicit instruction’ (Coe et al., 2014). This is in contrast to less guided instruction, where pupils are left to ‘join the dots’ or discover things themselves. Once a teacher has established their classroom expectations, maintaining good pupil behaviour while adding to their teaching repertoire requires effective instruction. There are links with the Instruction strand later in behaviour. |\n| Practice           | Getting pupils to think about and practise expected behaviours, by guiding them and reinforcing desirable behaviours, can foster positive changes in pupil behaviour change over time (IES, 2008). Guided practice can develop pupil metacognition linked to specific tasks, and practice can also develop pupils’ capacity to self-regulate their emotions, which can support pupils to be more successful and independent over time (EEF, 2017).                                                                                                                                              |\n\nHolding high expectations is one particularly important yet hard-to-pin-down part of creating an effective learning environment. When we talk about teacher expectations we mean: the beliefs that teachers hold and the messages that they communicate regarding what their pupils are capable of, both in terms of behaviour and learning. In turn, this influences the levels of classroom challenge and support that teachers provide (Coe et al., 2014). Inadvertently communicating low expectations can lead to a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, where pupils behave and learn in line with what the teacher expects rather than what they are capable of (Murdock-Perriera et al., 2018; Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010).\n\n#### Nuances and caveats\n\nBehaviour is only one piece of the effective teaching puzzle. Effective instruction and sound teacher subject knowledge are also critical (Coe et al., 2014). And perhaps most importantly, these different dimensions of effective teaching influence each other – it is only when they are aligned that effective teaching can flourish (IES, 2008).\n\nSo, while Ms Foden must work hard to develop her understanding and approach around behaviour, she must also recognise that this needs to go hand-in-hand with things like providing the right balance of challenge and support for helping her pupils to experience regular success in the classroom. It is little wonder that becoming a great teacher takes time and continued learning.\n\n$I\n\n<h4>Key takeaways</h4>\nMs Foden can promote positive pupil behaviour and an effective learning environment\nby understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Holding high expectations, creating an effective learning environment and\n    managing behaviour effectively all positively impact pupil learning\n    outcomes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Creating an effective learning environment over time can also have benefits\n    for classroom relationships, pupil attitudes to learning, pupil wellbeing\n    and wider outcomes and wider school culture.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can create effective learning environments through proactive,\n    reactive and escalation strategies.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can foster further effective learning behaviours through developing\n    behaviours that help pupils to learn more successfully.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teacher expectations play an important (yet complex) role in influencing\n    pupil behaviour and learning.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Balancing the challenge and support that teachers provide in order that\n    pupils experience success is key.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp; $I\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nCarroll, J., Bradley, L., Crawford, H., Hannant, P., Johnson, H., &amp; Thompson, A.

When they're in place, classrooms\nwork better, and everyone has more time for learning. And when teachers set up routines,\nthey have a great opportunity to build a culture and environment that will help their\npupils to learn. So routines are a brilliant place to start.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWe know that the environment in which pupils learn can have a big impact on the quality\nof their learning. All pupils thrive in an environment where they feel safe and secure,\nand predictability can help with this. A predictable and secure environment can be\nparticularly valuable for pupils with SEND.\n\nPredictable doesn't mean boring or unstimulating. Quite the opposite. A predictable environment can provide the structure and security that enables pupils to do a wide range of activities such as playing, asking questions and thinking deeply. All of these can benefit learning.\n\nTeachers can use routines to build a secure environment. Where there are good routines in place, pupils know what they should and shouldn't do, which helps them to succeed. It also tends to reduce negative behaviour. And when everyone sticks to the routines, the classroom can feel predictable and safe.\n\nGood routines also free up more time for learning. We knew that doing the same thing over time can help us to become more fluent in it. And once we do something fluently, it means we are drawing on information in our long-term memory, which frees up space in our working memory. This should help pupils to pay attention to what they're learning.\n\nIn order to establish routines, teachers need to plan, teach, and constantly reinforce routines with their pupils.\n\nIn the first instance, teachers need to think carefully about the most important routines that they need and then plan how they will establish them. Typical classroom routines include how pupils enter and exit the classroom, how materials are handed out, how pupils move from one space in the room to another, how they respond to questions, and the routines for paired and group talk. These are things that pupils do all the time, so it's worth creating a routine for them. When planning a routine, it's useful to consider what the pupils should be doing, what resources they might need, and what the teacher should be doing.\n\nOnce teachers have thought through their routines, they need to explicitly teach them to pupils and get all their pupils to practice and repeat them. When doing so, it is important that their instructions are specific, sequential and manageable.\n\nYou might also discuss why the routine is there and how it can help pupils to achieve important classroom values.\n\nAnd when a routine is in place, teachers need to help it stay in place by clearly reminding pupils of what they need to do. Positive reinforcement is a great way to communicate the shared values that improve classroom and school culture. For example, teachers might reinforce the entry routine by thanking a pupil who walks into the classroom calmly or acknowledge a pupil who gets started with their work straight away. We can't assume that pupils will know what this culture is. As key role models, teachers have to tell them and show them.\n\nAll of this may take time to get right, and you may need to revisit routines across the year, but it is time and energy that is well worth investing in. Great classroom routines help to create a space where all pupils can learn.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>A key routine that teachers might want\nto think about is how their pupils will enter their classroom. In a moment, we are\ngoing to look at an entry routine. As you watch, pay particular attention to the\nfollowing:\n<ul>\n  <li>Explicitly teaching routine and behavioural expectations</li>\n  <li>Positive reinforcement</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nThe way that pupils enter the classroom can have a big impact on the start of\nthe lesson. We want to help them enter calmly and focus their attention on what\nthey're about to learn. Imagine that I'm teaching a year four class. I've\ncollected them from the playground after break, and they are lined up waiting to\nenter the classroom. When they enter, there is an activity asking them to\ncomplete punctuation errors in simple sentences. This is something that they\nhave practiced before, and I know that my pupils can all access the learning on\ntheir own. I've previously taught the class how I want them to enter the\nclassroom, and they've practiced this. Now they're doing it well, I want to\nreinforce our entry routine so it really sticks. Before the lesson, I quickly\nscripted what I want to say to make sure that my instructions are really clear.\n\n<em>\n  “Good morning year four, it's lovely to see you all lined up so silently. So\n  when we come into the classroom today, remember you're going to move straight\n  to your desk, begin the starter task in silence. Okay, first 10, in you come.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher gestures to pupils to walk in. Teacher is intentionally looking at\n  pupils lining up in the corridor and watching them as they enter the\n  classroom]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Morning, Arfan. Morning Artek, morning Chante. I can see Arfan's already\n  started the task in silence, thank you. Morning, Lily. So has Chante. Thank\n  you.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher notices that one pupil is not doing the starter activity so looks at\n  them and then points at the instructions on the white board]\n</em>\n\n<em>Everyone moving nice and silently, thank you.”</em>\n\nSo let's unpick the model. To begin with, I set clear expectations. I told them to come in, to move to their seats, and then begin the starter activity in silence. I then reiterated these instructions as the first couple of students entered. My pupils are familiar with this routine, but it's still important to remind them of each step, in detail. First, they enter the classroom in silence. Then they sit at their seat and begin the starter activity. My instructions were specific and sequential, which helped pupils to follow them.\n\nI used positive reinforcement to help maintain the routine. As soon as I noticed pupils who were doing what I expected, I pointed this out. Arfan has made a start. Again, even when pupils are confident with the routine, positive reinforcement helps to keep it in place.\n\nYou might also have noticed that I gave a non-verbal reminder. At one point in the routine, I noticed that one of my pupils hadn't started to work as I'd asked. I looked at the pupil, then pointed at the instructions on the whiteboard. This quick, non-verbal reminder was enough to get the pupil back on track and it didn't distract me or the other pupils. I was able to see this behaviour because I was standing in a position where I could see both into the classroom and the pupils as they entered, and I was constantly checking both.\n\nFinally, I created a culture where trust and respect are important by greeting each pupil in the same polite, warm, and friendly manner. In doing so, I'm welcoming each pupil into the classroom and establishing a positive tone for the lesson. I want my pupils to be polite, so it's essential that I model this to every single one of them. And I also want them to begin the lesson with a positive interaction.\n\nOverall, my instructions help pupils follow the routine and get started quickly.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've thought about the role that routines play in the classroom,\nidentified the key features of a good routine, and looked at an example that demonstrates\nthese. Before we finish, take a moment to read through the key features of effective\nroutines.\n<ul>\n  <li>Explicitly teach routine and behavioural expectations</li>\n  <li>Practise routines</li>\n  <li>Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions</li>\n  <li>\n    Use consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom\n    directions\n  </li>\n</ul>\nWhich of these ideas do you currently recognize from your school setting?\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>A big part of our job is to build an environment where\npupils can learn and succeed.

However, only about half of his pupils are starting the lesson in this way. Some pupils are taking up to ten minutes to settle and are slow to start tasks during the early part of the lesson. What might Mr Price do to tackle this challenge?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEstablishing and maintaining routines can increase both the amount of time that pupils spend learning, and the quality of that learning.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The power of routines\n\nRoutines are just any aspect of the classroom that have a repeating and familiar pattern. There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that establishing and maintaining routines leads to positive, predictable and motivating classrooms (Kern & Clemens, 2007).\n\nWhen pupils are able to predict the events that happen during their school day, they are more likely to be engaged and less likely to exhibit undesirable behaviours. Routines are great ways to increase the predictability of the classroom, particularly at the start of the school year.\n\nAspects of the lesson that are ripe for building strong routines include:\n\n- How pupils enter the classroom and start the lesson.\n- How pupils finish the lesson and exit the classroom.\n- What pupils do when they complete activities or get stuck.\n- How pupils engage in classroom discussion.\n\n### Setting expectations\n\nTo set up routines in ways that work and last, teachers need to communicate and reinforce expectations of what should happen. If pupils are not clear about what they are expected to do, routines are unlikely to take hold and remain.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that the higher the expectations that teachers have of their pupils, the better the behaviour will end up being. And if multiple teachers are able to set and maintain expectations, then behaviour will be better across the school as a whole (Kern & Clemens, 2007). Mr Price should recognise his responsibilities as part of a wider system of behaviour management, but also understand that he has the right to support and training from senior colleagues.\n\nCommunicating expectations around routines are most effective when they are:\n\n- **Concise:** Communicate the routine using a few clear steps. Complexity can be added as routines get embedded.\n- **Positively framed:** Say what you want pupils to do rather than what you don’t want them to do.\n- **Modelled:** Regularly show your pupils what you want them to do, particularly when you are in the early stages of establishing a routine.\n\n### **Getting routines to stick**\n\nAs well as setting clear expectations for a routine, we also have to think carefully about how we make that routine last. Routines will simply dissipate as pupils forget and other things interfere, unless we take intentional steps to make them stick. To maintain routines, we can (IES, 2008):\n\n- **Revise:** Continually repeat our expectations of what we think the routine should be like and why, even after pupils have ‘got it’.\n- **Re-practise:** Keep getting pupils to do the routine. In the early days, you can even get them to do a ‘rehearsal’ or two.\n- **Reinforce:** Use the school behaviour system (e.g. praise, rewards and sanctions) to help pupils keep to the routine. To be effective, reinforcement should be mostly positive and consistently applied.\n\nWhen routines are established, not only do they create more time and a better environment for learning, but they can help teachers see and deal with undesirable behaviour as soon as it arises. Routines create predictable patterns of classroom activity and so make it easy to spot when behaviour deviates from what is expected. Catching and correcting challenging behaviour early can make pupils feel safer and creates a warmer classroom environment where learning is more likely to occur (Kern & Clemens, 2007).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nIs it realistic for Mr Price to expect all the pupils he teaches to meet his high expectations and adopt routines? Research suggests that clear expectations and predictable consequences are beneficial to both pupils with and without special educational needs, and especially useful for younger pupils (DfE, 2017; Gathercole et al., 2006).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Price can use routines to establish positive behaviour for learning by understanding\nthat:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Routines can create a positive and motivating climate in the classroom.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    High expectations can improve pupil behaviour at both a classroom and school\n    level.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    For routines to take hold expectations must be clearly communicated and\n    modelled.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    For routines to stick they need to be revised, re-practised and reinforced.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nIES.

Teachers\nneed to give clear instructions so that pupils know what to do and how to do it.\nGood instructions can also help to create an effective environment and improve pupil\nbehaviour. When teachers give instructions, they have the chance to explicitly state\ntheir expectations so that everybody can meet them. We can achieve a lot with a few\nwell-planned words.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nThe moments when a teacher sets out the activity instructions matter a lot. Good\ninstructions can increase desirable behaviour and help pupils to get on with the\ntasks and activities set. So teachers need to plan their instructions carefully.\n\nFirstly, you need to think about what you will say. Provide manageable, individual steps and specifically point out what pupils should do. And try to keep instructions short. Cut out redundant words. In an EYFS setting, for example, you might say, \"<em>first,</em> <em>let's stand up with two feet on your bug spot”</em>, instead of a more long-winded version like, <em>“first I want everyone to stand up and stand right on your bug spot so that we can get ready to move back to our seats.”</em> We can only think about a few things at once, so it's important to limit the number of steps or words in our instructions. Focus on what matters the most.\n\nOrdering steps sequentially also helps pupils to follow them. For example, <em>“first you need to highlight a key phrase, then you need to label what it means.” </em> Another approach is to tell pupils what to do with their mouth, their body and their brain. For example, you might ask pupils to <em>“work in silence on your own and order the fractions from smallest to largest.”</em> This format won't be appropriate in all instances, but where it is, it can help both pupils and teachers remember what to do.\n\nVisual supports can also help pupils to understand instructions. For example, you might want to add a recognizable hand gesture for activities that pupils are familiar with. And you might also wish to include a list of written instructions to accompany your verbal instructions so that pupils can refer back to them.\n\nAs well as thinking about what to say, you need to think about how you will say it. Think about how you're standing and your tone of voice. You need to make it clear that what you're saying is important and that pupils should pay attention to it. Teachers need to stand at a spot where they can see all pupils and they need to stand still. This allows both teacher and pupil to focus on the content of the instruction. As for voice, it's good to speak in a formal tone when delivering instructions.\n\nIt's easy to overlook the importance of instructions. Teachers spend lots of time thinking about what pupils will learn and designing a great task, but can sometimes forget to plan how they will explain it to pupils. There's a risk that this planning time will go to waste because pupils won't know how to get on with the task. It's worth scripting out what you will say and practicing it. The more you do this, the quicker you will get at it, and the more effective your instructions will be.\n\nWhen pupils have a good understanding of how to do something, they're much more likely to give it a go.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn a moment, you're going to watch a model of how to deliver effective task instructions.\nAs you watch, pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Manageable, specific and sequential instructions</li>\n  <li>Uses voice and body to ensure pupils pay attention</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year three class who\nare working hard on an independent writing task. I'm going to gain their\nattention and give instructions for what to do next.\n\n<em>\n  “Pens down, hands on desks and eyes on me in three, two, and one. Thank you.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>Okay, I need you to listen really carefully for what to do next. </em>\n\n<em>\n  One, put your book in your folder. Two, put your folder in the middle of your\n  table. Make sure they are facing up. Three, put your hands on your desks and\n  look at me so that I know you are ready.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>I need you to do all of this without speaking.</em>\n\n<em>Okay. Mohammed, where do you need to put your book? </em>\n\n<em>And Stewart, where are you going to put your folder? </em>\n\n<em>And Ashley, how are you showing me you are ready? </em>\n\n<em>Thank you. Okay, 30 seconds, off you go.”</em>\n\nIn this model, I made sure that my instructions were manageable by breaking down the task into three small steps. I was really specific, telling them precisely where to place their books and their folders. And I presented the steps in a sequential order. First, they put their books in their folder. Then they put the folder in the middle of their tables. I also included non-verbal signals. For example, placing the books in the folder, to help draw attention to this step.\n\nI used consistent language. <em>“Pens down, hands on desks” </em>is a phrase that I repeat throughout my lessons, which helps it to stick.\n\nAs I spoke to the pupils, I used a formal tone of voice. I use this tone of voice for instructions because I want to signal that what I'm saying is important. It encourages the pupils to pay attention.\n\nOverall, the instruction had clarity, both in terms of content and delivery. All of this together helps my pupils to know precisely what I'm asking them to do, making it more likely that they will be successful.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nEffective task instructions can have a positive impact on behaviour and learning\nwhen teachers make it crystal clear to pupils what they need to do.

At these times they often take a while to settle, and sometimes even do the wrong things. She also finds herself having to repeat her instructions multiple times which can take up valuable learning time. How can Ms Silva best manage these transitions to help her pupils get on with their learning quickly and independently?\n\n## Key idea\n\nSetting high expectations and providing clear instructions are powerful ways to foster good behaviour and create an effective learning environment.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### **Teacher expectations matter**\n\nSetting and communicating clear expectations has a strong influence on pupil behaviour (Murdock-Perreira & Sedlacek, 2018). For example, conveying low expectations can generate a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ where pupils end up behaving according to the expectations we have set, rather than what they are capable of (Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010). Sometimes teachers can communicate low expectations without realising. This can happen when we ask certain pupils more questions than others, or when we permit pupils to call out when they shouldn’t.\n\nTo mitigate this, Ms Silva should be intentional about holding and communicating high expectations for her pupils. This means:\n\n- Continually assuming that all her pupils are capable of behaving well and making progress in their learning.\n- Relentlessly communicating to pupils that she knows they are capable and that she expects nothing less than exemplary behaviour and learning from them.\n- Regularly providing clarity to her class about the kind of classroom culture that she values.\n\n### Clear instructions can make a huge difference\n\nGiving instructions is a great opportunity to embed high expectations into your lesson. Delivering instructions effectively can help make lesson transitions go smoothly and foster a purposeful and effective learning environment (IES, 2008). Effective instructions can reduce challenging behaviour, reinforce desirable behaviour, and make the classroom more structured and predictable for pupils (Kern & Clemens, 2007). For example, directing pupils to sit in a seating plan and giving them clear instructions for how to begin the starter activity increases the chances of an orderly entrance and successful start to the lesson.\n\nInstructions are powerful because they act as a reference point that pupils use as a guide for what to do and how to do it. However, giving effective instructions is not always easy to do well. In particular, there are two features of how pupils think that can thwart our efforts:\n\n1. **Limited working memory:** People can only think about so many things at once. If we give our pupils too many instructions to hold in their heads, it is likely that they will be unable to retain any of them.\n2. **Forgetting:** People forget things. This is especially true when instructions are overly lengthy or for unfamiliar classroom activities (Gathercole et al., 2006).\n\nBoth of these situations are exacerbated by the mental demands of the classroom. During our lessons, we often ask pupils to both hold instructions in their heads and think hard about lesson content - for example, when we expect pupils to remember our instructions for conducting a paired discussion while also considering complex questions about Caesar’s invasion of Britain. To make it feasible for our pupils to meet high expectations, we must make sure our instructions are easy to understand and put into practice.\n\n### Issuing effective instructions\n\nBearing in mind the above features of how pupils think, classroom instructions are likely to be more effective when they are:\n\n- **Stepped:** The best instructions are broken down into a clear sequence of manageable steps (Gathercole et al., 2006).\n- **Brief:** They include as few steps as possible and get straight to the point, especially when giving instructions for new or unfamiliar activities. If you are struggling to achieve a low number of steps, it may be worth looking at making the task itself less complex.\n- **Visible:** Displaying instructions in addition to communicating them verbally means that pupils won’t have to remember them while also thinking about the lesson content.\n- **Checked:** Pupils can easily misunderstand initial instructions. Checking that pupils have understood the steps before letting them get on with the task can increase the chances that they do the right thing (Rosenshine, 2012). This also increases the chances of them remembering the instructions.\n- **Supported:** Consistent language and non-verbal actions for common classroom directions also make them more likely to be memorable.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nIt is important to think about how we communicate instructions. Timing, tone of voice and how we model instructions can all make a difference to how well they are taken on board. Providing clear instructions is beneficial to all pupils but it can be especially important for younger pupils, those with Special Educational Needs and those with lower working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Silva can improve pupil behaviour and learning by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Holding and communicating high teacher expectations can improve pupil\n    behaviour.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instructions can both prevent problems occurring and reinforce\n    desired behaviours.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Delivering effective instructions involves a concise ‘what’ and a clear\n    ‘how’.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Checking that pupils understand instructions before letting them start\n    increases the chances of success.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nGathercole, S., (2008) The Psychologist.

But behind this picture\nlies a lot of careful work and effort. It doesn't just happen by accident. Once teachers\nhave set up a task successfully, they need to help their pupils stay on task. There\nare simple but powerful strategies that teachers can use to direct attention and\nhelp their pupils be at their best.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWe need to pay attention to something in order to learn it, and yet, paying attention\nisn't always easy. It may be that the content is unfamiliar. Most people will struggle\nto keep hold of information when they know very little about it. It can be harder\nto pay attention to something that you don't feel you're good at. Competing distractions\ncan get in the way, someone whispering behind you. Some pupils with SEND may find\nit hard to pay attention at times. But whilst paying attention can be difficult,\nthe good news is we can help.\n\nThere are several strategies that teachers can use to help their pupils pay attention to learning. Teachers can establish a classroom environment that is an effective place for all pupils to learn. Having good systems in place is important, such as where pupils store their materials. Depending on the individual needs of pupils, teachers may want to put additional supports in place to help pupils focus on their learning. For example, if you have a pupil with a hearing impairment, you should identify the most appropriate seat for that pupil. It is important to discuss this with the pupil, their parent or carer, and the specialist staff in the school.\n\nAs well as shaping the classroom environment, teachers also need to think carefully about what they do within the classroom environment to help pupils pay attention. Giving manageable and specific instructions helps. These instructions should clearly tell pupils what they should be doing and how, such as <em>“complete the number sentence in silence”</em>. It can also help pupils by focusing their attention on the most important aspects of a task: <em>“remember to include the equal sign”</em>.\n\nAnother strategy is to draw attention to the sorts of positive behaviours that are likely to enable pupils to succeed. Teachers can do this by identifying the positive behaviours that they want to see in advance, explicitly naming the behaviour that will help, and then pointing it out when it occurs. For example, when setting pupils up in a group task, the teacher might identify that one pupil should take notes during the task, name this by saying, when one person is talking, the other person needs to make brief notes about their most important points. And then point it out when they see it: <em>“great, Gabriel is making some really useful notes.”</em> Explicitly naming behaviours can be especially helpful for some pupils with SEND.\n\nDuring an activity, teachers can reinforce positive behaviours by looking out for them and describing what they see. A teacher might say, <em>“Toby has got started on the task straightaway”</em>, or, <em>“Fatima is making sure she is pausing to read her writing as she goes.” </em>It doesn't need to be a constant duration. If a pupil is purposefully engaged in an activity, then intervening with a narration about their behaviour might be a distraction. However, a brief and carefully timed positive reinforcement can be really powerful.\n\nIn order to reinforce positive behaviours, teachers need to actively look for them. This means standing in a position where teachers can see all pupils and proactively scanning the classroom. Pointing out the positive behaviours of some pupils can encourage others to do the same.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to direct pupil attention. As you\nwatch, pay particular attention to the following.\n<ul>\n  <li>Rigorously maintaining expectations</li>\n  <li>Using positive reinforcement to keep pupils on track</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nPositive reinforcement is a great way of helping pupils to meet your\nexpectations. For the purposes of this model, I'm an RE teacher with a class of\nyear eight pupils. It is the end of the lesson, and I'm getting my pupils ready\nto leave. After I have given my instructions, I'm going to look out for positive\nbehaviours.\n\n<em>“In three, two, one, looking at me. </em>\n\n<em>\n  When I say go, I want you to open your books to today's work and put them at\n  the back of your desk, I want you to pack the remaining things into your bag,\n  and I would like you to stand behind your chair with the chair tucked in\n  showing me that you're ready.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>Off you go. </em>\n\n<em>\n  The front row have got their books open at the back of their desk, well done.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The middle row have packed away the rest of their things. Anna is already\n  standing behind her chair showing me that she's ready. Well done, Anna.”\n</em>\n\nLet's unpack this example. First, consider my position in the classroom. You will notice that I was standing where I can clearly see all of my pupils. If I'm going to spot positive behaviour, I need to be able to see it. I also want my pupils to know what I'm looking out for. So I was surveying the classroom in a slightly exaggerated way, craning my neck like this. Having set up my expectations in the instructions, I'm making it really clear to pupils that I expect them to be maintained.\n\nMy instructions were specific, sequential and manageable. I set out precisely what pupils needed to do in the order that they needed to do it. And I tried to keep my instructions short. As pupils become more familiar with the routine, I may be able to replace words with non-verbal gestures, but at this point, I still need to support pupils by explicitly stating what they should do.\n\nNotice that I gave a short pause between the countdown and giving my instructions. I want to make sure that all pupils are listening.\n\nAnother important aspect of this model is that I narrated the positive behaviours that my pupils carried out. I used neutral, descriptive language and kept it short. I hope that by doing this, it will provide another opportunity for pupils in the classroom to know what they should be doing.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nNow that you have seen a clear model of how to direct attention, read through the\nkey ideas that we have covered in this video. Which of these ideas do you think that\nthe example illustrated best?\n<ul>\n  <li>Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions</li>\n  <li>Teach and rigorously maintain clear behavioural instructions</li>\n  <li>Monitor these values with gaze</li>\n  <li>Vocalise positive examples of these expectations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nThere are lots of ways in which teachers can support their pupils to pay\nattention to learning. And this is a really important part of our role.

However, during her expositions or when pupils are working independently, she finds that some pupils simply drift off and stop paying attention to her or the task. What could she do to keep her pupils focused for more of the lesson?\n\n## Key idea\n\nAttention naturally drifts and so teachers need to continuously monitor and actively direct pupil attention to maintain a classroom where all pupils succeed.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Attention wanders\n\nMs Silva has high expectations of her pupils. She regularly communicates these and keeps her instructions clear and concise to help pupils meet these expectations (Gathercole et al., 2016). However, even this does not guarantee that her pupils will continue to pay attention throughout the lesson.\n\nIt is natural for the mind to wander after a time, particularly in busy environments such as the classroom (Sweller et al., 1998). Attention is also influenced by pupil motivation. For example, where pupils believe they may be unsuccessful, they can end up avoiding a task, while prior experiences of success make them more likely to persist at similar tasks (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).\n\nWhatever the reason, Ms Silva needs to recognise that pupil attention wanders, so this is something she needs to take responsibility for and direct as needed to keep her pupils learning.\n\n### Directing pupil attention\n\nA variety of strategies can be used to direct pupil attention. These include:\n\n- **Modelling:** Showing pupils exactly what paying attention looks like.\n- **Reinforcing:** Acknowledging or praising pupils who are demonstrating good levels of focus, being specific about what they are doing to earn this recognition.\n- **Positively framing:** Saying what you want to see from pupils rather than what you don’t want to see.\n\nOne useful distinction here is to appreciate the difference between praise and acknowledgement. Praise entails rewarding a behaviour that exceeds expectations, whereas acknowledgement entails showing that you have noticed a behaviour that meets expectations. Over-praising pupils who are merely following standard rules can inadvertently convey low expectations and hamper learning (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nPupil capacity to self-regulate their emotions and behaviour influences how well they can direct their attention towards specific tasks. No-one is able to completely self-regulate their attention at all times, and this ability varies between individuals. But self-regulation can be developed, improving pupils’ abilities to learn effectively (EEF, 2017). In addition, our behaviour is influenced by that of our peers. The more pupils that are paying attention, the more others will be encouraged to do so (IES, 2008). Effective teachers take account of these factors to help their pupils focus by using, for example:\n\n- **Brief reminders:** Issuing a quick reminder of what is expected, using consistent language and non-verbal signals. “We’re just waiting for one more person to face the front in silence, thank you.”\n- **Private reminders:** Having subtle conversations with individuals when it is only a few who need support to stay focused. “Hi Jenny, let me know if there is anything you need to help you get started.”\n- **Benefit of the doubt:** Communicating a belief that off-task behaviour is a result of enthusiasm for learning rather than purposeful disruption. “I know you are really keen to discuss this task with your partner but, to do a good job of it, first you need to put your pens down and face me.”\n\n### Pupil perceptions matter\n\nPupils tend to have a more positive classroom experience when they feel that their teacher is effective at managing the attention and behaviour of the class. This is important because pupils who have positive classroom experiences are more likely to feel wider life satisfaction and get better results. Pupils see effective teachers as those who (Rathmann et al., 2018):\n\n- Are aware of everything in class, instantly noticing when pupils aren’t paying attention.\n- Manage to quickly re-involve pupils if they don’t pay attention for a moment.\n- Have the class under control.\n\nTherefore, as well as directing pupil attention, effective teachers might choose to be highly visible in how they do it. Being seen to actively monitor the room, direct attention and control the lesson can help pupils to feel that they are in a safe environment and pay even more attention.\n\n### Change takes time\n\nExplaining a classroom routine just once or delivering a set of instructions without follow up is rarely enough to create lasting classroom change. For high expectations to become embedded, teachers need to continually remind and reinforce (IES, 2008).\n\nReinforcement is more effective when it acknowledges positive behaviour more often than highlighting negative behaviour. Over time, this approach has been shown to increase academic engagement and focus (IES, 2008).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nAcknowledgement, praise and reminders are powerful teaching tools for directing attention. However, there are also times when teachers simply need to issue a sanction or escalate the issue in line with the school behaviour policy. For example, when pupils are being defiant, inhibiting learning or risking the safety of others (IES, 2008).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Silva can direct pupil attention and increase learning by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Self-regulation and pupil motivation can affect how pupils direct their\n    attention, which naturally wanders over time.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Proactively monitoring, modelling and reinforcing helps direct pupil\n    attention and keep them on task.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    When reinforcement is positively framed it makes pupils feel safe and\n    creates a more productive learning environment.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can redirect attention in the least intrusive ways.

Pupils talking when the teacher is, refusing to work\nwith a talk partner, prodding a pupil when sitting on the carpet. These are distractions\nthat can get in the way of learning, particularly during teacher-led instruction.\nThis is different, of course, from interactions that occur when pupil are involved\nin meaningful activity, such as child-initiated play. It may be tempted to ignore\nlow-level disruption, but it can reduce both the amount and quality of thought that\npupils give to their work. So teachers need to find ways of reducing low-level disruption\nand supporting all pupils to stay on task.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWhen teachers respond quickly to low-level disruption, they send a clear message\nto their pupils that they have high expectations of them all. They show that they\nwant to create the most effective learning environment possible, one in which all\npupils have the opportunity to think, learn and grow. So what can teachers do? We\nmight divide our approach in two. There are proactive strategies and reactive strategies.\n\nProactive strategies are things that teachers can do to prevent low-level disruption. Reactive strategies are ways to respond when it occurs.\n\nProactive strategies include things like clear routines and instructions, naming the positive behaviour that will help learning, and acknowledging positive behaviour when it occurs. Reactive strategies include pausing mid-sentence if a pupil is talking when a teacher is, reminding pupils of expectations or addressing an individual directly. For example, in an EYFS setting where a child is playing with another child's chair on the carpet, you might quickly say the pupil's name and state what they should do: <em>“Theo, looking at the picture.”</em> These are all least intrusive responses which teachers can deliver quickly without drawing too much attention to the disruption. There may be times when this won't be enough, such as when bullying or behaviour threatens emotional safety. Teachers need to choose a response that is appropriate to the behaviour.\n\nIf a pupil is talking when the teacher is, the teacher can pause, wait until the pupil has stopped and then continue. When pupils haven't followed the instructions that a teacher has given, it can be helpful for teachers to quickly and clearly restate or remind them of their expectations. Restating expectations can be helpful if a pupil hasn't understood them. Reminding pupils helps if they've forgotten. Regular opportunities to follow instructions benefit all pupils.\n\nSometimes addressing an individual pupil directly with a concise reminder will be most appropriate: <em>“Kaley, facing me.”</em> Pupils often respond positively when they know that a teacher has addressed low-level disruption. It can help to build a culture of mutual trust.\n\nIt's important that teachers respond to low-level disruption calmly and consistently using a neutral tone, including reference to the shared values of the classroom and school, and applying them fairly to all pupils. This can help to create a supportive and inclusive environment that benefits all pupils.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to respond to low level disruption.\nLook out for the following.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Responds quickly to low-level disruption using least-intrusive interventions\n  </li>\n  <li>Responds consistently to pupil behaviour</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nLow-level disruption can be a real problem in classrooms, and we need to address\nit quickly. I'm going to model some of the ways in which you can do this. The\ncontext is a year 10 music lesson. The pupils have been working at their\nkeyboards working on their compositions, and I have now signalled for them to\nremove their headphones so they can hear me.\n\n<em>“Okay, so when I finish speaking, I want you to turn off your </em>\n\n<em>[Teacher pauses and waits to gain full attention of the class] </em>\n\n<em>\n  Turn off your keyboards, unplug your headphones, and turn to show me that\n  you're ready. Off you go.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher stands still, intentionally scanning classroom to spot pupils who are\n  following instructions]\n</em>\n\n<em>I've got the back table facing me. </em>\n\n<em>[Teacher notices a few pupils not following instructions]</em>\n\n<em>Just waiting for three more people. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay, we're ready. Okay, so Kaitlin I want you to play the first four bars of\n  your composition, okay?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Everybody else, hands off your keyboards and listening out for the 4/4 time\n  signature. Off you go.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher approaches a pupil who has not followed instruction and addresses\n  them directly, in a quiet and neutral tone]\n</em>\n\n<em>Riley, hands off the keyboard please.”</em>\n\nIn this example, I used several proactive and reactive interventions for low-level disruption. Remember that you might not need to use all of these strategies at once or in the same order.\n\nFirstly, I stopped speaking when one pupil was fiddling with the headphone wire. This was a reactive strategy. In my classroom, I've established the expectation that pupils need to look at me when I'm speaking. Pausing in a way which is obvious when one pupil is off task is often enough to get their attention and remind them and the others of the expectation to look at me. I've consistently maintained this expectation, and over time, the vast majority of pupils meet it.\n\nA proactive approach I used was to use a positive frame. When some of the pupils were not unplugging headphones and turning off keyboards as I expected, I focused first on those that were. A quick reminder to pupils of what I expect them to do is often enough to stop low level disruption. I then follow this up with a second reminder, <em>\"I'm waiting for three pupils\"</em>. An anonymous reminder like this can help get pupils get back on track without drawing lots of attention to the negative behaviour.\n\nFinally, I modelled how to respond on an individual basis where appropriate. Riley wasn't sitting still and listening to the composition as he had been asked to do. So I walked up to his desk and give him a clear reminder: <em>“Riley, hands off the keyboard”</em>. As with the previous examples, I used a quiet tone so as not to escalate the situation, but equally, I made my expectations clear. There should be no room for confusion or disagreement here. Notice that my tone throughout was formal and neutral when issuing the intervention. I reverted to my original tone when pupils were back on task. I want to respond to low-level disruption in the same consistent manner whenever it occurs. Spot it, address it and get back on with the lesson as quickly as possible.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nThis video has covered a range of ideas and strategies to help you respond to low-level\ndisruption. Read over the key ideas before you finish. Which of these ideas will\nyou focus on first?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Use early and least intrusive interventions as an initial response to\n    low-level disruption.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Establish a supportive and inclusive environment by giving pupils\n    opportunities to follow instructions.\n  </li>\n  <li>Respond consistently to pupil behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nResponding to low-level disruption isn't something that only new teachers should\nthink about. Staying on task can be difficult for all pupils. Learning requires\neffort, and sometimes it feels hard. All teachers need to be aware of this and\nknow how they will respond when a pupil gets off task. This will help to\nmaintain a positive and effective learning environment for all. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B5.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Silva feels she can secure positive behaviour from most pupils most of the time. However, she occasionally finds a few pupils are not following her instructions or are being disruptive in subtle ways. For example, having whispered conversations during a silent task, or turning around to talk to others when she is not looking. Ms Silva worries that, over time, others will begin to follow suit. How can she address this low-level disruption?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTackling low-level disruption – both proactively and reactively – can improve learning and foster a positive classroom environment over time.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Proactively addressing low-level disruption\n\nMs Silva has noticed occasional instances of low-level disruption. Research suggests there is a link between time on task and pupil learning (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010), so low-level disruption is a problem because it reduces time on task, making the learning environment less effective. Effective teaching can address this by _proactively_ avoiding problem behaviours where possible and reacting to get learning back on track (IES, 2008).\n\nIn effective learning environments, pupils are clear about what they are expected to do (IES, 2008). Ms Silva has already considered how to convey clear behavioural expectations through routines, instructions and directing pupil attention. Fundamental to this is ensuring expectations are specific enough for pupils to know exactly what they are expected to do, without any confusion or ambiguity, making it less likely they’ll go off-task. For example, ”I expect everyone to be silent, with pens down and eyes on me” is more concrete than “I need your attention”, where it is not clear whether pupils are still allowed to talk, where they should be facing or what exactly they should be doing. In the second example confusion or ambiguity could lead to pupils going off-task. Alongside clear behavioural expectations it is also helpful if teachers explain the purpose and benefits of a task so pupils know both what they are expected to do and why.\n\nShe can also be proactive by positively reinforcing these expectations through acknowledgement, drawing attention to these behaviours. For example, once she has shared a concrete behaviour, she can say ”I can hear Sarah and Katie talking in partner voices about question 2.” She could also make links to shared values and classroom and school culture: “I can see Katie and Sarah are taking turns, which is respectful.” She should however avoid lavish praise unless expectations have been exceeded, as unwarranted praise lowers pupil motivation (Coe et al., 2014).\n\n### Reactive teacher reminders help pupils stay on task\n\nReminders are powerful reactive strategies to ensure pupils successfully stay on task once proactive strategies have been used. While clear and concise expectations help pupils understand what strategies are best applied to tasks, effective reminders can help pupils follow through with those strategies (IES, 2008). Many of the strategies that teachers employ to direct pupil attention are also useful for tackling low-level disruption.\n\nFor example:\n\n- **Anonymous & positive framing:** Picking out examples of expected behaviour without naming names. “I can see four people have already opened their exercise books.”\n- **Targeting specific pupil behaviours:** Naming and reminding particular pupils what they should be doing using concise language. “Edward: facing your partner.”\n- **Private correction:** If pupils need a further reminder or sanction, doing this privately, where possible, in a quick one to one conversation avoids class attention and saves face for the pupil. For example, quietly saying to an individual “That’s a first consequence. I should see you facing your partner discussing the work.”\n- **Highlighting the benefits:** Teachers can briefly remind pupils of the purpose of the task and how it might help them achieve their goals during the task. “Knowing your number bonds will help you solve numerical problems much faster.”\n\nTaken together, such strategies can reduce low-level disruption and increase the likelihood that pupils successfully complete tasks. Effective learning environments are predictable (IES, 2008), so Ms Silva needs to be consistent with her reminders, for example by linking them to school rules and behavioural expectations.\n\n### Improving pupil-teacher relationships\n\nConsistently addressing low-level disruption can also improve pupil-teacher relationships and pupil wellbeing. Pupils have positive perceptions of predictable and secure learning environments, where teachers effectively monitor and manage the class (Rathmann et al., 2018). In contrast, when teachers show low expectations of pupil success, this can lead to reduced pupil self-belief and motivation (Tsiplakies & Keramida, 2010). This can sometimes happen in an unspoken and unintentional way. For example, correcting minor transgressions by some pupils but not others can imply the teacher thinks some pupils are more likely to misbehave or less able to complete a task than others. This can have a knock-on effect on pupil motivation and learning, which can be particularly detrimental for low-attaining pupils (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). Teachers must be careful not to inadvertently communicate low expectations by permitting low-level disruption or being inconsistent. What we permit, we promote.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nTeachers do not need to respond in a subtle way to **every** instance of disruption. School behaviour policies often have rewards and sanctions and it is appropriate to use these, particularly to address significant disruption. But where possible, proactive, least intrusive and positive reinforcement of clear behavioural expectations are most effective (IES, 2008). Prevention is better than cure.\n\nNegative pupil emotions can also lead to low-level disruption where pupils avoid learning. This can happen where pupils suspect they might fail at a task, especially when failure poses a threat to their positive self-image (Kluger & DeNisi 1996). In the longer-term, teachers can address this by developing pupils’ ability to self-regulate their emotions (EEF, 2017). Immediately, teachers can usually avoid this issue by ensuring clear expectations and reminders give pupils the best chance of being successful. Teachers can also make extra reminders and help private, to preserve pupil self-image in front of their peers and give pupils time to respond to the correction, to overcome possible emotional responses to having their behaviour corrected.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Silva can begin to address low-level disruption by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Addressing low-level disruption means supporting pupils to meet clear\n    behavioural expectations that ensure the learning environment is effective\n    and that pupils remain on task.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    This can be achieved through proactively communicating expectations and\n    reactively reminding pupils in a way which is consistent, proportionate and\n    reinforces wider school expectations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Consistently addressing low-level disruption can improve pupil-teacher\n    relationships and classroom culture.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nEEF (2019) Improving behaviour in schools.

Behaving in the same way\nover time helps pupils to know what to expect from their teacher. This creates trust.\nIt also helps to create a predictable and secure environment that we know benefits\nall pupils.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nIn practice, consistency applies to many parts of teaching. It means giving clear\nexpectations that set out what you would like pupils to do, modelling the behaviours\nyou expect to see, and supporting pupils to do the same through positive reinforcement,\nfor example. It means repeating the same, specific words to communicate classroom\nand school values. This requires planning and practising, and it means treating every\nsingle pupil with the same polite, respectful, and courteous manner that you would\nask for in return. It is also important that teachers respond in a consistent way\nto similar behaviours from different pupils, both positive and negative. Sticking\nclosely to the classroom behaviour system really helps with this.\n\nHere's one way of rewarding positive behaviour.\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Briefly state the behaviour.</li>\n  <li>Set out the reward.</li>\n  <li>Explain how this will help the pupil to achieve a long-term goal.</li>\n</ol>\nLinking positive behaviour to success in learning may help pupils to be motivated\nby intrinsic factors, rather than extrinsic ones.\n\nHere's one suggestion for how you might give a sanction.\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Briefly state the behaviour.</li>\n  <li>State the consequence.</li>\n  <li>Explain to pupils how they can get back on track.</li>\n</ol>\nFor example: <em>\n  “Callum, you were talking when Iris was giving her answer. That means you\n  missed out on hearing her great answer. You need to pay attention to what\n  everyone says during class discussions. You can use those ideas in your own\n  work, and it shows you value others.”{\" \"}\n</em>\nIssuing sanctions in a consistent manner each time helps teachers and pupils to\nremain calm. It also deescalates the situation and ultimately helps to build\ntrust.\n\nRewards and sanctions are not the only way of encouraging positive behaviour. Teachers need to help pupils behave in a way that supports learning because they want to do it for themselves, but rewards and sanctions can help pupils to get there, so teachers need to know what the system in their school is.\n\nThe more that pupils see a teacher behaving in the same way over time, the more likely they are to associate that teacher with those qualities. If teachers behave in a way that is consistent, pupils will feel that their teacher is consistent. This, in turn, creates a sort of trusting relationship that benefits pupils' learning.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of one way to respond to a pupil who's\nbeen repeatedly off task. As you watch, focus on the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Responds consistently to pupil behaviour.</li>\n  <li>\n    Applies sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating\n    behaviour incidents as appropriate.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification</h3>\nIn this example, I'm going to model how to give a sanction to a pupil who is not\ndoing what I have asked. I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year 10\nscience class. Pupils are working on an independent writing task, comparing two\ndifferent models of the atom. I've provided lots of support and guidance to\nensure that the pupils have the knowledge and skills to attempt this task. The\nexpectation is, therefore, that pupils are silent and remain focused on the task\nwith pen to paper, and this has been shared with the pupils. If they have a\nquestion, they ought to raise their hand to gain my attention. Here, a pupil\ncalled Tom has turned around and tried to talk to his friend. My first response\nis to give a reminder without naming Tom.\n\n<em>\n  “We need to be facing forwards, working silently, pen to paper. If you have a\n  question, you need to raise your hand.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Teacher looks towards pupil who is not following instruction]</em>\n\n<em>Tom, facing forwards, working silently, thank you. </em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher pauses and scans the room. As pupil does not follow instructions,\n  teachers approaches pupil to address them directly.  Teacher{\" \"}\n</em>\n<em>\n  crouches in front of the desk, in a position where he can still see the rest\n  of the class]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Tom, this is the third time that you've turned around in your chair. You need\n  to be facing forwards, writing. If you need help, raise your hand and I will\n  come and help you. Thank you for starting writing quickly, good job.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Teacher circulates the classroom and then returns to Tom]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Yeah, lovely work, Tom. I can see that you've already compared the position of\n  the electrons in the two models, good work.”\n</em>\n\nThe aim of the model was to show how to respond consistently to pupil behaviour in line with school policy. When I first saw a few pupils, including Tom, turned around or chatting, I gave an anonymous reminder of my expectations that pupils should be facing forwards and writing silently.\n\nWhen I then saw Tom was still turned around in his chair, I gave a quick, named response. This is an escalation, as Tom now knows I have noticed that he is not following instructions, and I've specifically reminded him of the expectations. I did this quickly and in a neutral tone. I don't want to draw attention this low level disruption, but I do need to respond to it.\n\nWhen I saw Tom turn around a third time, I gave a private sanction, which included stating the error, stating the consequence, and explaining how he could get back on track. I ensured that the conversation was not in front of the class because this can sometimes escalate a situation, and I wanted Tom to focus on what I was saying. I also quickly acknowledged that he had listened and was now following my instructions.\n\nLater in the lesson, having focused for the remainder of the task, Tom had produced some high-quality work and I praised him for his effort.\n\nI treated Tom in the same way as other pupils, holding him to account when he was off task, praising his efforts when appropriate. My tone was the same throughout the model, formal and calm. This consistent tone shows pupils that I'm able to manage the situation and that I will maintain my expectations I have set out.\n\nFinally, my language was consistent. I used language and a structure that my pupils are now familiar with. <em>“Face the front” </em>is a short, quick phrase that clearly tells pupils what to do, and one which I always use. And I use the same format for issuing a sanction: state the error, state the consequence, and explain how to get back on track.\n\nResponding to pupil behaviour in the same way over time means that I can act quickly and fairly. This normally deescalates negative behaviour and maintains a positive learning environment.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have considered why it's important that teachers are consistent\nand looked at some ways in which they can achieve this. Take a moment to read the\nkey ideas. Which ones do you think the example best illustrated?\n<ul>\n  <li>Responding consistently to pupil behaviour.</li>\n  <li>\n    Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating\n    behaviour incidents as appropriate.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom\n    directions.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nResponding consistently to pupil behaviour can be hard in the beginning. It can\nbe difficult for teachers to know what they will say and do on the spot. Picking\none specific response to plan and practise outside of the classroom really helps\nyou to know what to do when you're standing in front of your pupils. Plan and\npractise in advance so you can be consistent in the moment. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B6.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Mahrez is able to tackle disruptive classroom behaviour when it arises, but some of her pupils need constant monitoring to keep them on task and others do little more than the minimum required to complete the task. What can she do to create an even more productive learning environment?\n\n## Key idea\n\nBeing consistent in sharing and reinforcing expectations supports pupil motivation. Over time it can generate an increasingly positive, stable and effective learning environment.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Consistency and systems\n\nWhen teachers are predictable in how they act, pupils come to know what to expect, feel more secure in the classroom and can focus more on their learning (Rathmann et al., 2018). Being predictable entails being consistent in how we respond to similar behaviours by different pupils (both good and bad), and by consistently modelling expected attitudes, values and behaviours (IES, 2008).\n\nOne way to increase the predictability of our action is by sticking closely with a classroom behaviour system aligned with wider school expectations. Such systems often include (IES, 2008):\n\n- **Proactive** teaching of sanctions and rewards.\n- **Reactive** procedures for responding to common situations.\n- Basic policies for **escalating** persistent or extreme behaviour.\n\nIt is important that the system is simple to follow and easy to remember, for example with consistent language and non-verbal reminders for common classroom tasks. When this is the case, Ms Mahrez will be able to respond quickly without having to think too hard about every situation, and so is more likely to respond consistently over time.\n\nThe most effective systems are those that use reinforcement of positive behaviours more than reprimands (IES, 2008). However, teachers must also be careful not to over-use praise (Coe et al., 2014), using acknowledgement when expectations are met (“Thank you for putting your pen down, Jen”) and only praising when they are exceeded (“Well done for constructing a sentence that uses powerful persuasive language, Jamil”).\n\n### Intrinsic motivation\n\nEffective classroom behaviour systems also make the most of pupils’ intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is when pupils do something because they want to, perhaps because it is related to their identity or values. In contrast, extrinsic motivation is where pupils do something because of a sanction or reward. This distinction is important because pupils who are motivated intrinsically are more likely to behave better and persist longer with tasks when they get challenging (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).\n\nOver time, teachers should aim to gradually reduce pupil reliance on external rewards or sanctions (IES, 2008). Ms Mahrez could do this by using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration, and helping pupils make links between their actions, successes and long-term goals. For example, when setting up a task which requires retrieval of prior knowledge, Ms Mahrez might say “successfully remembering this will help you to learn about figurative language, which is crucial for much of the English we’ll learn in the future and will also help you with everyday reading and writing”.\n\n### Consistency and pupil-teacher relationships\n\nEffective whole school environments often include:\n\n- High expectations from teachers of pupil learning.\n- Consistent enforcement of collectively agreed upon disciplinary policies.\n- Effective classroom management (Chapman et al., 2013).\n\nTherefore, individual teachers have a role in communicating shared values and improving classroom and school culture. They can do this by reinforcing expectations and following school behaviour policies in their classrooms and around the school. For example, challenging pupils on their manners in the corridor or upholding school rules in the playground.\n\nTeacher consistency can also improve pupil-teacher relationships. Pupil perceptions are based on repeated interactions over time, so when teachers consistently manage the class in a controlled and positive way, pupils are more likely to believe that their teacher has their ‘best interests at heart’ and feel more ‘connected’ to school (Chapman et al., 2013). When this happens, pupils are more likely to interpret corrective interactions from their teacher – for example, being reminded to turn around and listen – as a supportive act rather than just a meaningless punishment.\n\n### Consistency breeds success\n\nIn addition to improving pupil wellbeing and whole school climate, consistency over time can have a positive impact on pupil outcomes. When teachers regularly communicate a belief that everyone is able to achieve academically, their pupils are more likely to live up to those expectations (Murdock-Perriera et al., 2018). Furthermore, when teachers are able to consistently enable success, pupils will increasingly believe in their own ability, feel more positive about school and improve their outcomes over time.\n\nIn short, consistency is a powerful tool for promoting high expectations, enabling a positive whole-school climate and building trusting pupil-teacher relationships.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nTeaching pupils strategies to develop their ability to self-regulate their emotions can also lead to more consistent pupil responses in the long term - for example, developing pupil emotional language to express the problems they are experiencing and self-calming strategies to support them to learn more effectively when the content is challenging (EEF, 2018). Supporting pupil success can also help (IES, 2008). Enabling pupils to be successful can minimise emotional barriers while developing emotional self-regulation.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Mahrez can improve the effectiveness of her classroom by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Consistency entails predictably modelling and enforcing classroom systems.\n    It is most effective when positive reinforcement moves pupils towards\n    intrinsic motivation.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Consistency can improve teacher-pupil relationships and school culture by\n    promoting shared values.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Over time, consistently enabling pupils to be successful can improve pupil\n    wellbeing, motivation, behaviour and academic outcomes.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nRathmann K., Herke M., Hurrelmann K. & Richter M.

We want the classroom environment\nto be positive, secure, and safe. We want all pupils to know that their efforts will\nbe acknowledged, their successes will be celebrated, and that they can learn from\ntheir mistakes. Teachers can create this positive environment and within it pupils\ncan thrive.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>A positive environment is one in which all pupils are supported\nto learn and develop, whatever their starting points. The teacher has high expectations\nof their ability and they're able to focus on their learning without getting distracted,\nencountering barriers or worrying about making mistakes. They are provided with helpful\nstrategies to self-regulate their emotions. All of this together helps to create\na positive and inclusive environment that helps all pupils to be successful.\n\nThere are many ways in which teachers can build a positive learning environment. Establishing effective routines and expectations provides an important foundation. This means your routines are running smoothly, you set clear expectations, including the positive behaviours that you want to see, and you are consistent in your approach. For example, before asking a question to the class you might remind them that making mistakes is normal and that everyone is expected to try. Or before taking individual responses, you might remind the rest of the class to think about how they can help if someone gets the answer wrong. We want to create an environment in which making mistakes and learning from them are a big part of the daily routine and it can be helpful to include this in your expectations.\n\nIt's also important to explicitly teach the sorts of behaviours that create a positive learning environment and support pupil learning. This will involve identifying the behaviours that you want to see and thinking of ways to teach them to pupils. In a primary setting, for example, you might want pupils to be able to express what they are feeling and so teach them about a range of different emotions to expand their emotional vocabulary, as well as physiological symptoms like sweating palms or more rapid breathing. These physiological symptoms are often signs of certain emotions and pupils need to recognize them so that they know what to do when they occur. Another strategy is to teach pupils how to use a sentence stem that helps them to express their feelings. I feel something because. Being able to name and describe emotions is an important first step in being able to self-regulate them.\n\nTeachers also need to model the positive behaviours that will support learning. Teachers are role models who can influence the attitudes, values, and behaviours of their pupils. This includes being polite, respectful, and courteous to all pupils, modelling what to do when they find a task difficult or modelling what to do when they make a mistake. For example, a teacher might say,<em> \"I know this task will feel difficult, but I'm going to attempt it, and if I get the answer wrong, I can fix it.  Mistakes are normal and this will help with my learning much more than if I don't attempt it at all.\"</em> What teachers do in the classroom can have a big impact on what their pupils do.\n\nAs well as modelling positive behaviours, teachers can reinforce positive behaviours by drawing attention to them. Teachers need to look out for positive behaviours from all pupils and acknowledge them when they occur, such as packing away their books neatly, reading over their work to check for spelling errors, or offering a toy to another child to play with. A simple neutral description of the positive behaviour works well. Teachers can praise behaviours that exceed their expectations. If a pupil works especially hard on a task, a teacher might say something like,<em> \"Well done for persevering through that second task, even though it was really challenging.\"</em> Drawing attention to effort rather than ability is an important feature of a positive learning environment.\n\nOf course, creating a positive learning environment doesn't mean that we avoid all negatives. There may well be times when it's appropriate and necessary to provide a sanction to a pupil, especially any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. Equally, over-praising pupils for simply meeting rather than exceeding your expectations can backfire as it might cause pupils to try less hard in the future. But, if we want our pupils to do their best work, we need to build an environment that is positive, predictable, and safe.\n\nTeachers have a huge influence on pupils. It's in their grasp to create an environment where pupils succeed.\n\n<h3>Exemplification framing</h3>\nLet's look at a model of how you can actively build a positive learning environment.\nYou're about to watch an example of how to respond to a pupil error. As you watch,\npay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Shows that making mistakes and learning from them are part of the daily\n    routine\n  </li>\n  <li>Creates a culture of respect and trust</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nOne way in which teachers can build a positive learning environment is to make\npupils feel safe enough to reveal errors. I'm going to model a way of responding\nto mistakes. I'm teaching a year nine maths class and they have just been\npracticing how to calculate percentage increase using the multiplier method.\n\n<em>\n  “Okay, I want to find out how much you understand about using the multiplier\n  method to calculate percentage increase, and as I said before we started\n  working, I'm going to call on some individuals to share their answers but also\n  their thinking process.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now remember, we haven't done this before and there are quite a few steps, so\n  you might have made some mistakes. Don't worry if you have, that is normal and\n  this will give you a chance to correct those mistakes.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now for those of you who are listening to people as they feed back their\n  answers, I want you to be thinking about whether you think the answer is\n  correct or not and be thinking about why. So we've all got a really important\n  job to do here so let's try our best.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>Okay, Anna, can you tell me what answer you got? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives incorrect answer] </em>\n\n<em>Okay, can you tell me how you got that answer? </em>\n<em>[Teacher uses same neutral tone]</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil explains their process and teacher writes it up on the board]</em>\n\n<em>Okay, thank you. We're going to come back to that. </em>\n\n<em>Josh, can you tell me what answer you got? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  And can you tell me how you got that answer? [Teacher uses same neutral tone]\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil explains their process and teacher writes it up on the board]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay, thank you Anna and Josh. I now understand a lot more about how you're\n  thinking.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Anna, you made a couple of mistakes. Put your hands up around the classroom\n  if, as you listened, you realized that you also made a couple of mistakes.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[A number of pupils put their hands up]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Yeah, so we're going to go through this process again now. We're going to\n  identify where we went wrong and then we're going to correct our thinking.”\n</em>\n\nIn this model, making mistakes and learning from them is just a normal part of what we do. I told pupils that it's likely that some of them will have made mistakes because this is new and challenging material. Anticipating mistakes helps both teachers and pupils to react in a neutral way when they occur. Mistakes are not surprising, they are to be expected. I also asked each pupil to explain their thinking so that we can identify the mistake clearly. I'm not just interested in whether the pupils got the answer right or wrong. Instead, I want to understand why they have given this answer. I want to understand their thinking.\n\nThis model also demonstrated a way of creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom. I reacted to both pupils who gave their answer in the same way, thanking them and using a neutral tone. I didn't comment on their answer at this stage. Also, I reminded all pupils that they could learn a lot by listening to someone else's response, even if it's wrong. I'm making it clear that in this classroom we value the contributions that every pupil makes.\n\nThis is one example of how you can create a positive learning environment but it won't be as effective on its own. Positive learning environments grow through an accumulation of small steps that teachers can plan and practise. Over time, and with a consistent approach, they can ensure that classrooms are a safe place for all pupils to learn.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video we've thought about what a positive learning environment might look\nlike and some of the ways in which teachers can achieve this. Before we finish, have\na look at the key ideas. Which of these are best illustrated by the model?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Creating a positive environment where making mistakes and learning from them\n    and the need for effort and perseverance are part of the daily routine\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all\n    pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour\n    expected of pupils)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nCreating a positive environment is an essential task for all teachers. It can\nhave a profound impact on pupils’ attitudes to learning and success at school.\nWe need to think carefully about this environment and take small, purposeful\nsteps to ensure that it works for all pupils. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B7.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Mahrez is increasingly pleased with the behaviour of her pupils. However, they are not always willing to think hard or take risks in their learning. For example, they are sometimes reluctant to contribute answers when they think they might be incorrect and give up quickly when tasks are challenging. She wants pupils to develop approaches to challenging goals which support them to be resilient and independent. How can Ms Mahrez move from simply managing behavioural issues such as low-level disruption, to actively encouraging behaviours that underpin successful learning?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers should seek to model and develop positive attitudes, values and behaviours that underpin successful learning – particularly emotional self-regulation – and show pupils the role of making mistakes in being successful.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Moving beyond compliance\n\nTeacher expectations matter: the extent to which a teacher believes a pupil is likely to achieve alters that pupil’s experience of the classroom and their own likelihood of success (Coe et al., 2014; Tsiplakides & Keramida, 2010). Ms Mahrez has communicated and embedded high expectations of pupil behaviour into her classroom routines and behaviour management systems. With these essential foundations in place, she now needs to build further on these to maximise pupil learning. This can be achieved by modelling and embedding attitudes, values and behaviours that support pupils to learn more successfully.\n\nEffective teaching sets goals which challenge pupils and is demanding yet supportive in ensuring pupils successfully meet these (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Mahrez has reflected on the behaviours she wants to see and those which her pupils would benefit most from developing to successfully tackle such work. For example, she wants her pupils to be willing to join class discussions and offer answers even when their thinking is not fully developed, or when there is a risk of being wrong. Pupils sharing their thinking will enable her to gather more information on what her pupils know and don’t know, improving her ability to teach responsively and supporting pupil success (Black & Wiliam, 2009; Speckesser et al., 2018).\n\nMs Mahrez’s focus is still on the climate in her classroom but it has shifted from behaviours which might hinder her teaching to behaviours which will support her to teach, and pupils to learn, more successfully.\n\n### **Modelling effective learning behaviours**\n\nAdults can be powerful role models for pupils. Where trusting relationships are present, what teachers do will influence how pupils behave and the choices they make (Johnson et al., 2016). Ms Mahrez realises that before explaining desired behaviours she first needs to model them – how she acts is as important as what she says. Once Ms Mahrez has planned exactly what she wants to model to pupils – for example, proactively contributing, sharing answers that they are unsure of and supporting others who contribute in class – she can then direct pupil attention to her behaviours in these areas.\n\nEffective teaching ensures that pupils experience success and helps them recognise failures as natural steps on the path to future success (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Mahrez can embrace this by showing pupils why errors are useful for her teaching, what a respectful and safe class climate looks like and calling on pupils to emulate these resilient and motivated behaviours.\n\nEffective teaching also seeks to develop pupils’ emotional self-regulation (EEF, 2018). By modelling the emotional impact of sharing an answer that might be wrong, she can help pupils develop their self-awareness (“this might feel hard”) and their self-regulation (“making an attempt and failing is a natural part of learning. Getting it wrong now is a step on the path to getting it right in the future”). This is crucial as often pupils refuse tasks where they feel there is a risk they will fail (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996).\n\n### **Supporting** **pupils to understand and adopt effective learning behaviours**\n\nIn addition to modelling, Ms Mahrez can improve her classroom environment by supporting pupils to understand and adopt behaviours and attitudes that will help them to learn more effectively.\n\nTo achieve this, Ms Mahrez needs to direct pupil attention to the specific behaviours she has modelled – particularly linked to resilience and motivation – and explain why these are important. For example, she can explain that it is important for pupils to be open in contributing answers in class so that she can understand their errors. She can also explain that she needs pupils to be supportive and respectful of each other to create an environment where classmates feel comfortable contributing even where they might be wrong. Pupil behaviours can further be shaped by behaviour they observe in their peers (IES, 2008). So, Ms Mahrez should draw attention to other pupils exhibiting the positive behaviours she wants to see.\n\nEffective teachers often attribute pupil success to ‘effort rather than ability’, and value ‘resilience to failure’ (Coe et al., 2014). In developing this attitude in her pupils, Ms Mahrez needs to reward effort and highlight its contribution to success. When a pupil works hard, thinks hard or attempts a problem, Ms Mahrez should construct her praise to help pupils understand that these behaviours and mind-sets are valuable approaches to learning that will make success more likely.\n\nWhen reinforcing her modelling, Ms Mahrez should ensure her words and actions line up. She should consistently remind pupils who are not meeting her expectations, and still distinguish between acknowledgement for expectations met and praise for expectations exceeded.\n\n### **Nuances and caveats**\n\nGetting the balance between pupil success and encouraging pupil errors is challenging for Ms Mahrez. Teachers should aim for a high success rate (Coe et al., 2014) while developing pupil emotional self-regulation to support them to address the inevitable negative feelings around errors.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n\nTeachers can create a positive environment where behaviour promotes learning by understanding that:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Teacher expectations affect pupil attitudes, values and behaviours, and\n    therefore influence learning outcomes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers are role-models for pupils. What teachers say and do will influence\n    pupil behaviour, attitudes and values.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can promote pupil behaviour which is resilient and motivated by\n    developing pupil emotional self-regulation. This means they have a healthy\n    approach to failure as part of the learning process and also ensures pupils\n    regularly experience meaningful success.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n$I\n\n### **Further reading**\n\nEEF.

This isn't\nunusual. Most people are put off doing something that feels difficult in favour of\nsomething that feels easier. It's important that teachers think about the supports\nthey can put in place to enable and encourage all pupils to access their learning,\nincluding pupils with SEND. Providing structured support of learning can lead to\npositive behaviour and help all pupils to thrive.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nProviding structured, supportive learning is about ensuring that all pupils can access\nthe content and think hard. When pupils are able to access their learning, they're\nmore likely to experience success. This can be motivating and lead to positive behaviour.\n\nLearning new material can put a strain on our limited working memory capacity as it tries to deal with lots of new information at once. This can easily feel overwhelming, but there are strategies that teachers can use to help focus students' attention and show them a clear route through. These include reducing distractions, breaking learning into small steps, and modelling.\n\nBreaking material into steps can really help pupils. For example, instead of setting a task in a primary maths lesson like multiply 26 by 40, we might identify specific steps. Partition the number 26, multiply each part by 40, and then add them together. In a phonics lesson, it is important that pupils practice segmenting a word into individual signs, such as er, uh, nn, before blending them together again. These individual steps helps pupils to know how to start and what to do along the way. Breaking material into steps can be especially helpful for pupils with SEND, as it can give them a clear picture of what they need to do now, and next, making learning feel more manageable. Teachers should also ensure that any new knowledge builds on what pupils already know. In the maths example, pupils will need to know about partitioning and multiplication.\n\nModelling learning and providing examples is another important way of supporting learning. As teachers model, they can help their pupils to stay focused by drawing attention to the key aspects of the learning. Thinking out loud and numbering the steps is another useful support. For example, <em>\"first I add up the ones. Then I add up the 10s.\"</em> It's also essential to keep checking that pupils are listening, pausing during the model if pupils get off track.\n\nPutting supports in place like breaking learning down and modelling does not just mean making it easy. Activities should require pupils to put in effort and think, but if a pupil can't access what they're learning, it's likely to have a negative impact on how they act in the classroom. Providing structured, supportive learning can help pupils to experience success, which in turn has a positive impact on behaviour.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to provide structured support of\nlearning. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Breaks complex material into smaller steps</li>\n  <li>Checks pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>A really good way of\nsupporting learning is to take an end goal and break it into smaller chunks.\nThese smaller chunks feel more doable and help to guide pupil thinking. Imagine\nthat I'm teaching a reception class how to form the lowercase letter m.\n\n<em>\n  “In handwriting today, we are going to be learning the sound, mm. Mmm. You\n  would have learned the sound in reception as down Maisie, mountain, mountain.\n  Now in year one, we need to be accurate with how our Ms look and how we form\n  our Ms. I'm going to show you how I would do it, and I want you to pay close\n  attention, because in a minute you will be doing it too.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher writes on white board] I'm going to start at the top of Maisie here.\n  I'm going to do a straight line down, straight, straight, straight, come back\n  up and stop at Maisie's shoulder [teacher gestures to shoulder]. I'm going to\n  form my first mountain by going around and down, and then back up. I'll stop\n  at the shoulder again, just to make sure both mountains are the same size. I'm\n  going to go around, down, straight, straight, and I'll add a flick of grass at\n  the end.”\n</em>\n\nIn this example, I was careful to break learning down into smaller steps. Individual steps included drawing a line straight down, starting the mountain 2/3 of the way up, at Maisie's shoulder, and ensuring that the mountains were the same size. These are the most important steps that I want pupils to remember. It's easier for them to focus on these smaller parts, one by one, rather than having to remember how the whole letter is formed at once.\n\nBefore I started the model, I made sure that every pupil was paying attention by explicitly telling them to watch me because they would be doing the same task on their own. During the model, I was constantly checking the whole group to make sure that all pupils were watching me form the letter. Notice how I help focus pupils' attention by repeatedly telling pupils where to look: <em>\"have a look\"</em>, <em>\"same size\"</em>. I'm helping to guide their thinking so that they pay attention to the most important things. I also reduced distractions by writing on a blank sheet of paper. Pupils can easily get distracted, so it's important that we think of ways to direct their attention.\n\nAfter I delivered my initial model, I would ask pupils to help me form another letter, prompting them to tell me the key steps. This will give them another good example and allow me to check that they have understood the task before getting them to work on their own. When pupils are clear about what they should do and how they can be successful, it motivates them to get started.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored how providing structured, supportive learning can\nimprove pupil behaviour, and considered some of the ways in which teachers can do\nthis. Now read through the following key ideas that the video has covered. Which\nones do you feel that the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>Break complex material into smaller steps</li>\n  <li>\n    Reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught\n  </li>\n  <li>Check pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nWhen pupils find learning too difficult, they can easily disengage. Breaking\ncomplex material down into smaller chunks and taking them through it step by\nstep shows them that they can be successful. And when pupils feel like they are\nable to do something, they're much more likely to give it a go. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B8.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Sterling notices that, while pupils are willing to attempt class work, when they perceive tasks to be too hard this leads to off-task behaviour – including getting distracted and sometimes distracting others. How can she make learning more manageable, supporting pupils to persist at tasks?\n\n## Key idea\n\nBreaking challenging tasks into steps and providing support when necessary makes it more likely pupils will persist with tasks.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Making learning manageable supports on-task pupil behaviour\n\nChallenging behaviour can arise when there is a mismatch between classroom academic demands and pupil capabilities (IES, 2008). This happens because working memory capacity is limited and can become easily overloaded when pupils are asked to complete tasks which are unfamiliar or overly complex (Gathercole et al., 2008; IES, 2008). Pupils may seek to avoid a task if it seems threatening to their sense of self (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996): for example, if a pupil thinks they might fail at the task.\n\nBy making learning manageable, teachers affect how pupils behave, as well as how they learn (IES, 2008). Ms Sterling has already been thinking about the foundations of managing behaviour: telling pupils the types of behaviour she expects, modelling this, and responding consistently. Refining her instruction is another way to improve pupils’ learning behaviours since students’ success can build their motivation and confidence (Coe et al., 2014). Introducing new material in steps is a particularly effective approach to making learning more manageable (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n### **Introducing new material in steps and using examples makes it more manageable**\n\nChecking pupil prior knowledge and explicitly linking new ideas to what has previously been learned makes it less likely pupils' working memory will be overloaded (Deans for Impact, 2015). Ms Sterling could use several instructional principles to support pupils in this way (Rosenshine, 2012):\n\n- Briefly reviewing what pupils have already learned.\n- Introducing new material in small steps.\n- Checking pupil understanding of the new knowledge regularly.\n- Allowing pupils to practise using this new knowledge in steps whilst providing models and scaffolds for this practice.\n\nIntroducing new materials in steps like this helps make new material more manageable, making it more likely pupils will persist with the task.\n\n### **Guides and scaffolds also help pupils think about key ideas to be learned**\n\nLearning can also be made more manageable by providing pupils with ‘scaffolding’. This can be tools that complete part of the task for the students, or a model of the completed task itself (Rosenshine, 2012). In the early years, scaffolds might even be physical objects such as counters and toys (EEF, 2017); among older pupils they could be cue cards or checklists (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nScaffolding simply means providing pupils with support to tackle a problem or demonstrate their learning (Rosenshine, 2012). By making the task more manageable, Ms Sterling can avoid overwhelming her pupils’ working memories and make it easier for them to focus attention on particular aspects. For example, worked examples can be particularly helpful for Ms Sterling’s pupils as these stop pupils searching for any possible answer to a task. This reduces distractions by supporting pupils to focus only on each step of a successful solution (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\nScaffolded tasks should be challenging as well as manageable. Making learning manageable doesn’t mean lowering expectations of all or some pupils. Where this balance isn’t achieved, pupils may become frustrated or bored, as the task can be perceived to be beyond (or beneath) their capability (van de Pol et al., 2015). This frustration or boredom can then result in low-level disruption. Scaffolding should therefore be used in a targeted way and be removed when pupils show they are able to be successful at a task, supporting pupils to become independent (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n### **Nuances and caveats**\n\nEnsuring pupil working memory doesn’t become overloaded doesn’t mean setting unchallenging work – it means helping pupils to think hard about what they have just learnt by providing structured support as appropriate (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\nWhile teachers provide pupils with temporary ‘scaffolds’, it is important that these are withdrawn once pupils are experiencing success, as scaffolds inhibit independent practice once pupils have mastered the material taught (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nWhile good task and lesson design can help pupils to focus, ultimate responsibility for a pupil’s behaviour rests with the pupil, not with the teacher. If a pupil is unfocused, a teacher may wish to consider whether a change to the task design might avoid this in future. But this does not mean that the solution to pupils’ lack of focus is always the teacher’s lesson design.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Ms Sterling can make learning more manageable for pupils by understanding\n  that:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      When academic demands are not well matched to pupil capabilities, pupils’\n      working memory can become overloaded, causing them to stop trying or go\n      off-task.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Introducing new material in steps, building on prior knowledge and using\n      guides and scaffolds all help to avoid overloading pupils’ working memory\n      and make it more likely that pupils will stay on-task.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nRosenshine, B.

All pupils, regardless of their starting point, need to encounter\nan appropriate level of challenge in order to move forward. Challenging content can\nbe off-putting, but challenge is a necessary part of learning. If pupils are going\nto meet the high expectations that are set out for them, then we need to think about\nhow we can make challenging content manageable and show pupils what to do when learning\nfeels difficult. Thinking hard is rewarding and teachers need to show all pupils\nhow to respond when they are faced with a challenge.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nChallenge is about moving pupils on to the next step, whatever their individual starting\npoints. For teachers, challenge is about knowing your pupils really well. This means\ntheir prior knowledge, their previous experiences of success, and their beliefs about\ntheir ability to succeed.\n\nWhen teachers get the level of challenge right for their pupils, pitching work that is not too easy but not too hard, pupils are more likely to experience a high rate of success and be motivated to keep going.\n\nChallenging content isn't just about making things really difficult for your pupils or setting hard work. We don't want to set pupils up to fail. Likewise, pupils might find some aspects of your subject more challenging than others. For example, your pupils might really struggle with drawing and painting but do brilliantly with sculpture.\n\nAs well as getting the level of challenge just right, teachers also need to think about how they can get pupils to embrace challenge. This can be a daunting task as most people tend to avoid things that feel difficult. How can teachers get pupils to see the value of challenging work and give it a go?\n\nTo begin with, creating a positive learning environment is an important first step. Teachers need to set high expectations, build trust, and encourage pupils to persevere with their learning. This may include teaching and modelling what to do when pupils face challenging content. For example, it may be useful to teach pupils to set a goal, identify a potential barrier, and then anticipate solutions: <em>“I know I want to use more academic vocabulary, if I can't think of the word to describe this idea I will look in the keyword bank that I have.”</em> Praising pupils when they exceed your expectations is also important and will help to build a sense of momentum.\n\nTeaching pupils strategies to self-regulate their emotions can also help them to embrace challenge. For example, it can help teach pupils how to recognize when they are feeling frustrated by a difficult task and how they can calm themselves down. Typical physiological signs include rapid breathing, sweaty palms, or a change in their tone of voice. Self-calming techniques include counting to 10, taking deep breaths, and thinking calming thoughts such as \"I feel calm.\" The ability to self-regulate one's emotions affects learning and so it's important that teachers provide practical strategies as part of daily classroom activities.\n\nAnother way to help your pupils embrace challenge is to ensure the tasks you set are achievable. This is easier said than done. It requires you to know your pupils really well and set tasks that just push them outside of their comfort zone and give them clear guidance on how to complete the work. Complex tasks need to be broken down.\n\nWhen pupils succeed at a challenging task, it helps them to see challenge as desirable. We want to support pupils to journey from a point where they are reliant on outside factors like praise to where they are happy to give it a go on their own. The more success pupils experience, the more likely they are to give it a go on their own.\n\nOne thing to be wary of here is that encouraging pupils to embrace challenge isn't just about telling them that they can do it. Providing motivational speeches can easily backfire if they fail. We need to encourage pupils to try but we also need to ensure they have the support they need to be successful.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn this next example, you will see a model of how to help pupils embrace challenge.\nAs you watch, look out for the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Sets tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a\n    challenging curriculum.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Helps pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated\n    to work intrinsically.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, I will model one way of helping pupils to embrace a challenging\ntask. Imagine that I'm teaching phonics to a reception class.\n\n<em>\n  “Now we're going to learn a new sound called a split diagraph, and this may\n  sound a bit tricky at first but we're going to be practising lots and lots\n  until you know it really well. Remember when set one sounds felt a bit hard to\n  learn at first and now you know them really well? As we get better at this new\n  sound, it's going to feel great that we've learned something new and when you\n  spot it in a book, it's going to help you read lots more words.”\n</em>\n\nSo how did I support pupils to master challenging content? First, I set a task that would stretch pupils but which was achievable. I was happy that pupils were ready to start learning a new sound as they have a really good understanding of set one sounds, individual letters like R, M, and A. So while the task was going to be challenging, it wasn't out of their reach and I showed that I would support pupils to master challenging content by reminding them that they would have lots of chance to practice.\n\nThroughout the model my language was consistent with our school values. In our school we talk about the importance of feeling proud when we put effort into our learning. Reminding pupils that they will feel good after learning something new together reinforces the shared goals that we are working towards.\n\nI also wanted to help pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically. To do this, I reminded them of an example when they have faced and overcome a challenging situation in the past and sharing the progress that they have made. Lots of pupils initially struggled with set one sounds but they are now much more confident and enjoying their phonics sessions. I also linked this learning to one of their own long-term goals, getting better at reading. This helps them to see the value of the task. Setting challenging tasks for your pupils is a really important part of learning. It needs to be done in a supportive way so that pupils can experience success.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored the importance of setting goals that challenge and\nstretch, and some of the strategies that you can use to do this. Before we finish,\nread through the key ideas that we have covered. Which ones do you feel best illustrate\nthe model?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Set tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a\n    challenging curriculum\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Support pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term\n    goals\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Help pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated\n    to work intrinsically\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nWhen we get the challenge right we provide our pupils with stories they can tell\nthemselves of mastering difficult content. This, in turn, can help them next\ntime they're faced with a difficult task. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B9.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nWhile pupils in Ms Sterling’s class are generally keen to give tasks a go, they often take the safe option and seek support from their teacher or peers whenever possible. How can Ms Sterling help pupils to adopt behaviours that make them more open to challenge?\n\n## Key idea\n\nPupils who experience success are more likely to be motivated, resilient and open to challenge.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The role of success\n\nPart of Ms Sterling’s job is to maximise pupil learning – this means providing the right level of challenge. However, as well as offering challenge, it is also important that tasks enable pupils to experience a high success rate. This balance is a tricky one to strike.\n\nEvidence suggests that if pupils struggle but are ultimately successful with a task, it is more likely they will remember the material (EEF, 2017). Where pupils have experienced success, they are likely to put in more effort, be more motivated and show more confidence in the future (Coe et al., 2014). This is because where pupils believe in their abilities to complete a specific task, they are more persistent at that task. Their investment is driven by their perceptions of success and failure, particularly if they have limited experience of meaningful success in the past (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).\n\n### Establishing high expectations of success\n\nResearch suggests that teachers should aim for pupils to be successful around 80% of the time (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Sterling can build pupil expectations that they will succeed in a task by:\n\n- **Offering rewards and praise:** Providing extrinsic motivation when pupils attempt challenging work. Using positive reinforcement more than negative works best (IES, 2008).\n- **Attribution:** Linking effort and success for pupils when introducing or framing tasks (Coe et al., 2014).\n- **Avoiding lavish praise:** If used without merit, praise can lower pupil confidence in their own ability (Coe et al., 2014).\n- **Championing challenge**: Sharing _how_ task effort will lead to future learning success. For example, directing pupils’ attention to others who have succeeded due to their effort, or saying: “this work is designed to be tough, don’t worry if you struggle, this will help you learn.”\n\nThese strategies rely on a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. It is worth noting that while teachers can harness **extrinsic** motivation to help get pupils started, **intrinsic** motivation is likely to get pupils to stick at tasks, particularly when things get tricky (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).\n\n### Effective teaching raises success rates\n\nMs Sterling can increase the chance pupils succeed at challenging tasks by using her emerging expertise in:\n\n- How pupils learn (Deans for Impact, 2015), for example taking care not to overload their working memories.\n- Her phase or subject specialism (Rosenshine, 2012; Coe et al., 2014), for example ensuring pupils have had enough input before they attempt challenging tasks, especially with specific barriers they might experience if the topic is particularly tricky, or they have special educational needs.\n\nHer classroom climate is also crucial: when Ms Sterling sets challenging work, there will be times when pupils fail. Building a classroom where pupils trust that failure is okay is therefore important to help pupils deal with failure as a natural part of learning.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nThe relationship between teacher expectations and pupil outcomes is indirect. Teachers can best convey high expectations by getting the balance of challenge and support right. This will ensure pupils experience success, which should increase their motivation and sense of self-worth, also supporting their resilience (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nWhen engineering a high success rate for pupils, Ms Sterling must be careful not to remove challenge altogether. Setting pupils up for success in unchallenging tasks does not build motivation and can embed low expectations if pupils interpret this as low teacher expectations (Coe et al., 2014). Instead, Ms Sterling should ensure she provides enough scaffolding for pupils to be successful and withdraw the scaffolding as pupils get better at a task (Rosenshine, 2012). She can also explain why she is withdrawing scaffolding.****\n\nPupil success at a task is an indication that they have successfully learnt lesson content, but not a sure sign – ‘learning’ and ‘performance’ are different.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Ms Sterling can support pupils to be more open to challenge if she\n  understands:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupil motivation is driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, prior\n      experiences and perceptions of success.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Teachers who give pupils experiences of success build not only motivation\n      but also resilience and belief in their ability to succeed.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Teachers with knowledge of how pupils learn can better balance challenge\n      and support and promote pupil success, which makes them open to challenge.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nCoe, R., Aloisi, C., Higgins, S., & Major, L.

Sometimes\nwe need to do this thinking on our own. There need to be times during lessons when\npupils work independently. Pupils are more likely to do this well when teachers give\nclear behavioural expectations for independent practice. We need to provide support\nand guidance when pupils work on their own.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nIndependent practice is about letting our pupils practice on their own. Our ultimate\ngoal is that pupils are able to use their knowledge and skills without teacher input.\nThis means free of the support of any teachers or other adults in the room.\n\nIndependent practice helps pupils to understand and explore content. We know that pupils need a chance to play, go over content or consolidate learning on their own. Even after first being exposed to the content, pupils need a chance to continue to practise independently. Practising can also help retain content so that pupils are able to use it in the future. But knowing how to work on your own is a discipline that needs to be learned. How can teachers help?\n\nFirst, you need to teach a pupil what your expectations for independent practice are. This involves knowing what expectations are and then explaining them to pupils in detail. Your expectations should be made clear through manageable, specific, and sequential instructions. Once you've shared your expectations, you need to check your pupils have understood them. Ask specific questions that test for understanding one instruction at a time.\n\nWhen you're confident that pupils have understood your expectations, there's still more to be done. During independent practice, you need to monitor how pupils are getting on. This might involve seeing their play or work by circulating the room. You should use this time to check pupils are meeting your behavioural expectations. Where they are not, you can support them as least intrusively as possible, by giving them a quick reminder. Make this a positive reminder. Instead of telling pupils what they shouldn't be doing, for example, <em>“don't talk”</em>, tell them what they should be doing, <em>“work in silence”</em>.\n\nSetting up independent practice requires a lot of thought. You need to explicitly teach your expectations. It might be easy to assume your pupils should know what is expected of them, but they may well not. Or they simply might've forgotten. Although we call it independent practice, that doesn't mean that teachers don't play an active role. Teachers need to actively monitor and support pupils to enable them to work on their own.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to establish behavioural expectations\nfor independent practice. As you watch focus on the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations for\n    independent work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Monitors pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIf we want pupils to focus on their learning and do well during independent\npractice, we need to establish clear guidelines. I'm going to model how to share\nbehavioural expectations before independent work and how to support them to stay\nfocused during this time.\n\nI want you to imagine that I am teaching a year six English lesson. Pupils are going to spend 15 minutes writing an opening to their own story. Over a sequence of learning, I've prepared the class for this task in a number of ways. We have studied the genre that they are writing in, and the pupils have created storyboards to structure their story. For the opening, we have co-written a model for the class and I have written some sentence starters and created a word bank for them to use.\n\nWith this preparation, I'm confident that the pupils will be able to complete the task independently, but I still need to support their behaviour.\n\n<em>\n  “OK, you're now going to spend 15 minutes writing the opening to your story.\n  During that 15 minutes, I need everybody to be working in silence so that you\n  can concentrate really hard. If you get stuck, before asking for help, I want\n  you to look at your storyboards, the model that we've just created together,\n  and the word bank and the sentence starters in your books. If you still feel\n  that you need help, then raise your hands. And either myself or Ms. Stevens\n  will come to you.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Ishmael, can you explain to everybody what I'm expecting you to do in the next\n  15 minutes?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupils gives correct response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Great. And Aisha, if you get stuck, before asking for help, what things should\n  you look at?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Thank you. OK. Does anyone have any more questions? Nope? Great. So I'm going\n  to put 15 minutes on the timer, off you go.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Teacher scans the room and then circulates as pupils practice]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Everyone should be writing, or reading through their storyboards or the model\n  on the board, or that word bank and the sentence starters in your book. I can\n  see lots of pupils are using really well-chosen adjectives to set the scene,\n  well done.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  If you've got your hand up, can I ask you to check that you've read through\n  your storyboards or the model on the boards, or those sentence starters and\n  the word bank in your books before asking for help. Thank you. So those of you\n  who are putting your hands down, that's showing really good problem-solving.”\n</em>\n\nLet's unpick this model. Firstly, I set clear expectations for behaviour. I stated what I wanted to see and hear from pupils. Pupils were to work on their own in silence for 15 minutes.\n\nSecondly, I shared the expectation that before asking for help, pupils should read through the model and scaffolds provided. I asked two pupils to reshare these expectations, partly to check for understanding, but partly to restate the expectation to the class. Critically, I was also sure that they had the knowledge, skills and scaffolds to be able to complete the task.\n\nDuring the independent work, I circulated and made sure that most of the time I positioned myself so I could see the majority of the class. I actively show the pupils that I was checking their behaviour. And when I saw pupils starting to drift off task, I quickly reminded them of my expectations. For example, <em>\"everybody should be writing or reading through their storyboards\"</em>. This reminder was phrased positively. It's more helpful to remind pupils what they should do rather than point out what they shouldn't. I also use non-verbal signals to individual pupils when required. I want to support pupils to keep on task without interrupting others. I also kept pupils on task by acknowledging pupils who were meeting my expectations. For example, <em>\"thank you to those putting their hands down\"</em>.\n\nIndependent work is critical for pupil learning. However, in order for it to be successful, teachers must be sure that pupils have the knowledge and skills required for the task, be clear on their behavioural expectations before pupils start and circulate to keep pupils on track.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have looked at how to support pupil behaviour during independent\npractice so that we can help them to stay focused. Now read through the key ideas.\nWhich of these ideas does the example illustrate the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Teach and rigorously maintain clear behavioural expectations for independent\n    work\n  </li>\n  <li>Check pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins</li>\n  <li>\n    Monitor pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nIndependent practice is a skill that pupils need to be shown how to do well. Our\npupils need support and practice to get the most out of it. When we get this\nright pupils are able to do some of their best thinking on their own and\nstrengthen their understanding in the process. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B10.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Silva feels that her pupils are now more open to challenge and will sometimes try to work without scaffolding. However, they still prefer to work with teacher or peer support and may be reluctant to work on their own. Ms Silva finds pupils engage well in helping her solve a tricky problem on the board, but when she says, “your turn”, there are some blank faces. How can she get pupils to adopt behaviours that support independent practice?\n\n## Key idea\n\nRegular, purposeful practice is vital for pupil learning, so teachers need to develop routines and behaviours that support independent practice.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The benefits and challenges of getting pupils to practise\n\nIndependent practice is vital to pupil learning and success. To learn, pupils need to think hard about the content they have been taught (Coe, 2013). Effective teachers give plenty of class time for independent practice (Rosenshine, 2012). It has clear benefits for pupils' learning in terms of:\n\n- **Developing pupil fluency:** When pupils practise, their understanding becomes more fluent and automatic, making it easier for pupils to apply their knowledge and learn new material (Rosenshine, 2012).\n- **Helping pupils remember:** For example, retrieval practice (getting pupils to recall what they have learned) is one of the best ways to ensure pupils remember learning at a later date (Pashler et al., 2008).****\n\nSometimes pupils avoid thinking hard – we all do. They also form unrealistic views of how much they know. Therefore, when given a choice, they often don’t choose effective study approaches (Pashler et al., 2008). For example, re-reading their notes may feel easy. Trying to recall what they have learned without support from peers or scaffolding feels harder, but is far more effective (Dunlosky et al., 2013). As pupils are also easily distracted, Ms Silva can best ensure they think hard by insisting that pupils practise independently.\n\n### Getting pupils ready for independent practice\n\nMs Silva should ask herself whether pupils are ready to practise independently. Do they realise why the effort of independent practice is important for their learning? Explaining the benefits of independent practice will help. For instance, she could explain that:\n\n- We learn what we think hard about.\n- Less support leads to better learning once pupils are ready to practise.\n- Effort makes success more likely (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nShe also needs ensure pupils practise successfully, as failure can damage pupil motivation and sense of self-worth (Coe et al., 2014). Independent practice is best done alone, so Ms Silva needs to provide enough support to ensure success. For example:\n\n- Introducing a manageable amount of new material.\n- Leading teacher-guided practice on the same material pupils will practise independently.\n- Providing scaffolding (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n### **Clear expectations and routines enhance independent practice**\n\nMs Silva can set up independent practice consistently, in a way that develops routines over time. This is likely to contribute to pupil success, helping pupils to value practice. So, Ms Silva should consider how she will consistently:\n\n- **Set clear behavioural and task expectations:** This means outlining the behaviours she expects to see during independent practice: ”I should see everyone focusing on their own work silently”, and the task and support she expects pupils to use: ”I want you to complete this exercise on the worksheet, without looking at the work we did last week” (Coe et al., 2014).\n- **Check for understanding:** When introducing the independent practice tasks, teachers should ask specific, task-focused questions to get a clear sense of whether pupils have understood instructions (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Silva should avoid questions like: “do we all understand this?”, where pupils’ default answer is ”yes”, even if they may not understand, or social pressure prevents them admitting to gaps in understanding (Rosenshine, 2012).\n- **Circulate:** Checking pupils are following instructions and holding them to account is distinct from supporting with work (Lemov, 2015). Research suggests that as teachers circulate, they should check in with individual pupils for no more than around 30 seconds (Rosenshine, 2012). Longer contacts could disrupt pupil independence by suggesting that teacher support is available.\n\nIf Ms Silva is finding many questions arise during independent practice, it might be that pupils are not ready or that they do not understand her expectations. She might consider stopping practice, checking that enough support is in place and that pupils have understood her expectations.\n\n### **Nuances and caveats**\n\nTeachers should not set independent tasks when pupils have very little knowledge of a topic (Coe et al., 2014). Pupils will need to be built up and supported through teacher input first. Once this has happened, relevant homework can also be good independent practice of what has been learned, particularly for older pupils. For young pupils, playful practice can be led by pupil interest and teachers should provide just enough support for pupils to be successful (Deans for Impact, 2019).\n\nEffective monitoring during independent practice is often non-verbal – for example, the teacher standing and visibly scanning the classroom. While the importance of reinforcing behaviours with public praise is well known (IES, 2008), during independent practice there is a risk of this distracting pupil attention. There are also benefits of collaborative learning (Kirschner et al., 2018; Rosenshine, 2012), however Ms Silva might prioritise getting independent practice right first to make it more likely collaborative practice succeeds.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Ms Silva can promote behaviours that support independent practice if she\n  understands that:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupils need to understand the long-term benefits of practice, even if it\n      feels hard.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      To practise independently, pupils need enough support and clear\n      behavioural expectations.

When pupils\narticulate their thinking to each other it can help to expose what they already know,\ndevelop their understanding, and reveal misconceptions. Pair and group work can also\ndevelop important interpersonal skills, the ability to listen to somebody else's\nopinion, and ask meaningful questions. Collaborative learning can be really powerful\nbut it needs to be implemented carefully. It's also important that you have secure\nfoundations in place, like good routines and clear instructions. This should help\nyou to focus more of your attention on the complex task of managing different groups\nat the same time.\n\nWhen asking pupils to carry out pair and group work, teachers need to think about how to structure it so that it can be successful whilst teaching clear expectations for behaviour and supporting pupils to stay on task.\n\nStructuring group work carefully includes ensuring that pupils have relevant prior knowledge to draw on, choosing how to group pupils carefully, and, where appropriate, telling groups which pupil will go first and nominating a pupil to feed back to the class.\n\nTeaching clear expectations for behaviour means intentionally naming the behaviours that you want to see and hear. This could mean behaviour that shows that a pupil is listening such as facing the person speaking, nodding, and not interrupting when they're speaking. Being explicit about how to interact with peers is important for all pupils and can be especially helpful for some pupils with SEND. Or it could include telling those listening to probe for more details, and getting pupils to check clear success criteria.\n\nOnce you have set out your behavioural expectations, it's important to give pupils time to practise them and correct any errors that you see. Practising routines for pair and group work can save a lot of time in the long run and it can make it a much more reliable tool for learning.\n\nDuring pair and group work, teachers need to support pupils to stay on task. This can mean circulating to see what they are doing, listening in to conversations, and checking that they are making notes as appropriate. Other forms of support for pair and group work include question starters, sentence stems, and vocabulary banks. These can help pupils to stay focused and improve the rigour of their talk.\n\nOverall, teachers need to make sure that they plan pair and group work carefully, set out clear behavioural expectations, and provide appropriate support. This will help pupils to get the best out of working together.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you're going to see a model of how to set up a paired activity.\nIn it, pupils are asked to recall previously learned content. As you watch, pay particular\nattention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations for pair and\n    group work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Provides scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of\n    dialogue\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nWhen pupils know how to take part in paired and group activities effectively it\ncan be a powerful tool to support learning. Just like teaching pupils how to\nengage in independent practice, we need to teach our pupils what our\nexpectations for paired and group work are so that over time these become\nroutine. We also need pupils to understand what the purpose of a paired and\ngroup activity is and how it will support their learning goals.\n\nIn this video, I'm going to model setting a paired activity which is used to consolidate prior knowledge through repeated practice. I am a Spanish teacher, teaching a year 10 class. In the previous two terms, pupils have been learning about describing and giving opinions about their school. I want pupils to recognize and practise using key knowledge within this topic in written and spoken form. Pupils have already carried out this group task before several times. The structure of the task and the task instructions remain the same each time because I want pupils to be focusing their attention on the content they are working on rather than the logistics of the task. However, even though pupils have done this activity before I want to remind them of the purpose of this group task and give clear instructions.\n\n<em>\n  “So we've been working on describing the school and your school routine. We're\n  now going to do a group task where you will practise writing and listening for\n  this content so that you're able to use the vocabulary with greater fluency.\n  You will work in groups of three. One person will dictate, one will scribe,\n  and one will be the checker. Just as before, on your tables, the piece of\n  paper will tell you which roles you have.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>So, person A, you have a partially completed text in Spanish. </em>\n\n<em>Person B, you have the other half of that text. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Person A, you will read the text you have, and person B, you will listen to\n  person A, write down what you hear so that you can fill in the gaps. You must\n  speak and write in Spanish at all times.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Person C, once A and B have finished their task, you are to check that what\n  they have written is correct. You are to note down any errors as well as an\n  explanation as to why it is incorrect.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>For example, an error could be missing an accent on a word. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Person C, when checking, just to help, you have a list of possible errors on a\n  piece of paper in front of you.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So, you have five minutes to complete this task so you need to work carefully\n  and efficiently. I will come round to support and just check on how you're\n  doing. You also need to speak in a low volume so that you're able to hear each\n  other read the texts.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Let's just check that we know what we need to be doing. So, what topic are we\n  practising in this group task? Tanya.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response] </em>\n\n<em>\n  Yeah, thank you Tanya. And how many people are there in each group, Rosy?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response] </em>\n\n<em>Yeah, there are three, aren't there? And what are the three roles, Tom.</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Great, thank you Tom, very clear.</em>\n\n<em> So, what are the roles then of person A and person B? Bill. </em>\n\n<em>\n  [Pupil gives correct response] Yeah, again, very clear, thank you. And person\n  C? Leah.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Yeah, they're the checker, aren't they? </em>\n\n<em>\n  Great, thank you. And if you do need support, what do you need to do? Steve.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response] Exactly, thank you Steve.”</em>\n\nThere are a few things that I want to draw your attention to in the model. Even though this was not the first time they carried out this group work task, I still set out behavioral expectations for the task in some detail. Each pupil knew precisely what they should be doing. I assigned specific roles to each pupil, gave specific instructions, and checked that they understood. I also set clear time boundaries. Giving a finite amount of time helps pupils to stay focused. Finally, I explained that I would circulate during the task. Circulating pupils when they carry out collaborative work gives me a chance to maintain the expectations that I had set out and check to see how I might support pupils.\n\nI also use scaffolds to increase the focus and rigour of pupil dialogue. In this instance, the worksheets with specific errors was one form of scaffold, and another form of scaffold was the fact that the partially completed texts are exemplifying a model dialogue.\n\nWhen pupils have the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in meaningful talk, and when they are guided by a set of clear behavioural expectations, pair and group work can enable pupils to process their learning in a powerful way.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nThroughout this video we have considered some of the practical ways which teachers\ncan help their pupils to get the most out of pair and group work. Before we finish,\nread over the key ideas that we have covered. Which idea would you prioritize for\nyour development and why?\n<ul>\n  <li>Teach and rigorously maintain clear behavioural expectations</li>\n  <li>\n    Consider the factors that will support effective collaborative or paired\n    work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of\n    dialogue\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nIt can be difficult to keep track of learning during pair and group work but\nthat doesn't mean we should shy away from doing it. Instead, we need to take the\ntime to set up pair and group work carefully and explicitly teach pupils how to\nbehave during these types of activities. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B11.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Silva can keep pupils on task when they practise independently. There are times when she feels it could be valuable for pupils to work in pairs or groups, but she is frustrated that pupils can go off task or produce poor work when she allows them to talk. How can she manage the way pupils conduct discussions so they get maximum learning benefit from collaboration?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers need to prepare for and intentionally support behaviours that enable quality pupil talk.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Getting pupil behaviour right in talk tasks\n\nAt the heart of pair and group work is effective pupil talk. High-quality discussions help pupils better understand what they already know by articulating their thoughts more clearly (EEF, 2018). Peer discussion is also beneficial for building vocabulary, and aids social and linguistic development (Alexander, 2017).\n\nHowever, when pupils work with their peers it can give rise to behavioural issues, as pupils may get distracted or be unable to complete a task. Just as when introducing other classroom routines, teachers should anticipate and plan to avoid behavioural problems (Kern & Clemens, 2007). To promote on-task talk, Ms Silva can:\n\n- **Outline behavioural expectations:** Where appropriate share specific words to try to use, time limits and rules for turn taking. The EEF (2018) provide an example of rules for discussion.\n- **Explain why these behaviours are important:** If pupils know _why_ something is effective, they’re more likely to do it properly and be more motivated to do the hard thinking expected of them (Coe et al., 2014; EEF, 2017).\n- **Check understanding:** To succeed, pupils need to understand behavioural expectations and task instructions (Rosenshine, 2012).\n- **Practise routines:** Pupils become more automatic and fluent through practice, so Ms Silva can ensure pupils talk successfully by regularly practising talk routines (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nMs Silva should pre-plan groupings, as pupil groupings can affect pupil motivation and behaviour (Tereshchenko et al., 2018). She may wish to get pupils to work in pairs first, as this will help pupils to practise routines, behaviours and strategies of discussion, making it more likely pupils will talk successfully before working in larger groups. Once pupils are on task and thinking hard in pairs, she might start to trial group work – but only if she is confident that this will benefit learning. In short, Ms Silva should take an intentional approach to grouping pupils.\n\n### Preparing talk tasks that support pupil learning\n\nAs well as getting the behaviour right, Ms Silva needs to ensure pupils have the best chance of learning successfully from talk. Pupils need to understand the goals of the task in relation to their learning. Because we ‘learn what we think hard about’ (Coe, 2013), Ms Silva’s aim should be to get _all_ pupils to think hard about important content during talk tasks. However, Ms Silva needs to balance this with ensuring that her pupils experience success, as this is critical for motivation and learning (Coe et al., 2014; Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nA key factor in ensuring pupils think hard and experience success is teaching in ways that avoid overloading pupil working memory (Dean for Impact, 2015). Ms Silva’s talk tasks are more likely to succeed if she:\n\n- Makes the tasks themselves simple, while keeping the content challenging (Gathercole et al., 2006). For example, using tasks with minimal steps.\n- Builds on existing pupil knowledge (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n- Provides enough guidance and support, for example, scaffolding (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nHigh-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary. Knowledgeable pupils are likely to get more insights from discussing their existing knowledge than they could without discussion (Kirschner et al., 2018). Therefore, Ms Silva should consider when in the learning sequence she introduces talk tasks, as they are likely to be more effective _after_ behavioural expectations become embedded and pupil knowledge increases.\n\n### Supporting pupils to manage their learning in talk tasks\n\nHaving prepared tasks that support on-task behaviour and learning, how can Ms Silva now manage pupils during talk tasks? She can:\n\n- **Circulate:** Ensuring pupils are on task and not struggling (Rosenshine, 2012).\n- **Support:** Directing pupil attention to available scaffolding (Van der Pol et al., 2015).\n- **Reinforce:** Using praise, rewards and sanctions to reinforce desired behaviours (IES, 2008).\n\nThe preparation Ms Silva has done should support pupils to self-manage their behaviour and learn more effectively. This will allow Ms Silva to focus more on supporting pupil learning and less on managing off-task behaviour during paired and group talk.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nIt is best when pupils are taught new knowledge before introducing pair or group work. They may struggle if peer collaboration is introduced too early in the learning sequence.\n\nWhile it is possible for teachers to pick up on pupil misconceptions during pupil discussions, this is not likely to be the quickest or most efficient way of checking for understanding: strong whole-class questioning might be more effective. Discussions are best used to help pupils organise their knowledge.\n\nAbility grouping shows limited evidence of impact on pupil outcomes (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Silva must ensure the groups pupils are placed in don’t negatively affect pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation. Ms Silva should ensure her within-class pupil groups are flexible and that she continuously considers why pupils are in a group because this is an effective way of tailoring support for identified pupil need(s) e.g. ensuring groups based on attainment are subject specific and changing groups regularly, avoiding the perception that groups are fixed.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Ms Silva can support talk that enables effective pair and group work by\n  understanding that:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      There are behavioural challenges particular to group and paired work.\n      Teachers can pre-empt them by pre-planning groupings, and sharing and\n      checking behavioural expectations and practice.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Effective talk tasks support pupils to talk successfully if they avoid\n      overloading pupil working memory so pupils can articulate key ideas,\n      consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Teachers can support pupils to manage their behaviour and learning during\n      collaboration.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nEducation Endowment Foundation (2018). _Sutton Trust-Education Endowment Foundation Teaching and Learning Toolkit._ [bit.ly/ecf-eef14](http://bit.ly/ecf-eef14).

But just\nsetting high expectations alone isn't enough. Teachers also need to show pupils how\nthey can meet them.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nTeachers can have a massive influence over their pupils. The expectations that teachers\nset for their pupils can shape the outcomes that they achieve both in school and\nbeyond, and not just in terms of academic success. Teachers have the ability to affect\nand improve pupil wellbeing, motivation, and behaviour. In order to achieve the best\nfor our pupils, we need to set high expectations, both of academic success and behaviour,\nand support our pupils to get there. This is true for all pupils, whatever their\nstarting point.\n\nHigh expectations for pupil behaviour can include a wide range of behaviours, such as being polite and respectful to each other, contributing to class discussions, working silently when asked, persevering during a challenging task. Some of these behaviours will be more obvious than others. Some pupils will arrive into your classroom being good at some and not others. But for every expectation that teachers set for their pupils, teachers need to show pupils how to achieve it.\n\nIn the first instance, manageable instructions, explicitly describing behavioural expectations and highlighting them through positive reinforcement helps pupils to meet high expectations. When pupils have done something that you have asked, such as placing their books in a neat pile, or answering in a full sentence once they have discussed an idea with a partner, acknowledging this positive behaviour can encourage others to do the same. When pupils exceed your expectations, such as being especially kind to a fellow pupil, or building on someone else's idea in a nuanced way, teachers can praise their pupils.\n\nAnother approach that can help pupils to achieve high expectations is to draw their attention to the behaviours that they have demonstrated. For example, to encourage a pupil to share their thinking, even if it is wrong, a teacher might remind the class that they have been brave enough to do this in the past and felt proud of themselves when they did so. Pupils can get better at regulating their behaviour when we help them to know how to respond to different situations.\n\nUsing intentional and aspirational language, and encouraging effort, also helps to create a classroom culture where pupils become used to working hard and trying their best. Pupils need to experience success in the classroom to feel they're capable of it. This means setting tasks that stretch pupils, and being explicit about the knowledge and skills that they need to acquire in order to carry out these tasks well. Once again, it's about showing pupils how to be successful, not simply setting your expectations high and hoping for the best. Powerful motivating words need to be accompanied by crystal-clear actions.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to establish high expectations during\na class discussion. Try to spot the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Teaches and rigorously maintains clear behavioural expectations</li>\n  <li>Acknowledges and praises pupil effort</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nFor the purposes of this model, I want you to imagine that I'm teaching a year\nseven English class \"Romeo and Juliet.\" I'm about to ask a series of questions\nto help consolidate and develop pupil thinking. My expectation is that everyone\nshould be willing to answer.\n\n<em>\n  “In a moment, we're going to be recalling some of the new vocabulary and ideas\n  we learned about Romeo in the last lesson, and I'm going to be asking you to\n  look for examples in the scene that we just read. Now, remember when I ask a\n  question, I expect everybody to be thinking of the answer, because if you do\n  that, it's going to help this new vocabulary stick, and you're going to be\n  able to use it in your writing later on in the lesson. So what does the word\n  'rash' mean? This is one of the words we looked at last lesson so I want\n  everyone to be thinking carefully. What does the word 'rash' mean? Oliver.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil says they don’t know]</em>\n\n<em>\n   Okay. It's okay if you can't remember. I'm going to ask the question again,\n  and Oliver, I want you to be listening carefully because I'm coming back to\n  you, okay? What does the word 'rash' mean, Elwin?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>\n\n<em>Great, good definition. So Oliver, what does the word 'rash' mean? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Thank you, Oliver. Okay, so what might an example of rash behaviour look like?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Great. So rash behaviour is doing something quickly without thinking through\n  the consequences, which are often negative. Okay everybody, I want you to scan\n  your texts and find an example of Romeo behaving rashly. Okay, Sarah.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  A great example. Can you explain why that's a strong example of Romeo behaving\n  rashly?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  That's a brilliant justification. You clearly thought about the definition of\n  the word rash because you've picked a strong quotation and you were able to\n  justify it in your own words.”\n</em>\n\nIn this example, there are a range of strategies that I've used to ensure that I maintain my high expectations of my class. I supported pupils to master challenging content. In this case, that meant acquiring a thorough understanding of a tier two word: rash. The support included reminding them of their prior knowledge, \"we looked at this word last week\", providing a clear definition, and asking the pupil to provide a concrete example. These small steps help pupils to access the more challenging part of the task: identifying an example of rash behaviour in the text.\n\nI encouraged all pupils to participate by asking the question to the whole class and pausing to allow them to all think before calling on one pupil. By naming a pupil after I've asked the question, rather than before, I'm keeping my options open for longer. Pupils are more likely to think about the answer as they may be called on. This is a routine that I've embedded with the class, and so pupils know what to expect.\n\nFinally, I helped pupils to experience success through their contributions. When Oliver didn't know the answer to the question, I asked another pupil, and then went back to Oliver to give him the chance to correct his thinking. This provided a great opportunity to remind Oliver and others of their ability to make progress. Pupils benefit when we help them to attribute successes to their efforts rather than to any innate ability.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've explored why it's important for teachers to have high expectations,\nand how they can help pupils to achieve them. Now read over the key ideas that we've\ncovered. Which ideas do you think the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>Teach and rigorously maintain clear behavioural expectations</li>\n  <li>\n    Support pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term\n    goals\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Acknowledge and praise pupil effort and emphasising progress being made\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nYou may well have seen some teachers who make setting high expectations look\neasy. Pupil behaviour is exemplary in their classrooms, and they appear to have\nsome kind of magic touch. But none of this is really magic. Helping pupils to\nmeet high expectations for behaviour as well as academic success occurs when\nteachers consistently show their pupils what to do. It's about being explicit to\npupils, and constantly reinforcing what we say.\n<p class=\"p2\">\n  <span class=\"s1\"> </span>\n</p>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_B12.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Mahrez has been working hard on conveying high expectations in her classroom, encouraging pupils to try hard and be open to challenge. However, she still occasionally struggles with low-level disruption and worries that her expectations may be unrealistic. On the other hand, when she looks at experienced colleagues’ classrooms, they seem to achieve better behaviour and learning from the same pupils. What role do high expectations play in pupil success and how can Ms Mahrez build a classroom that consistently delivers high expectations?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can uphold high expectations by ensuring pupils are supported to achieve classroom success over time.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The role of teacher support in pupil success\n\nMs Mahrez is determined to uphold high expectations but she worries that there is a gap between her ambitions and what her pupils can achieve. To close this gap, one of the most important things Ms Mahrez can do is create a learning environment where pupils experience a high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012). Over time, pupil success can unlock the other learning behaviours Ms Mahrez seeks to promote.\n\nTo promote pupil success, Ms Mahrez’s classroom should demand a lot of pupils, but should also support pupils to meet these demands. To help with this, she can:\n\n- Celebrate pupil resilience to failures along the way.\n- Encourage pupils to attribute successes to their efforts and smart strategies rather than any innate ‘ability’ (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nMs Mahrez’s role in securing success is partly about ensuring pupils have enough support, particularly with challenging tasks. If support is absent, pupils may fail to meet Ms Mahrez’s high expectations which may damage pupil perceptions of self-worth. She also needs to take care not to inadvertently communicate low expectations, for example by setting tasks which are too easy, or by over-praising pupils for simply meeting expectations (Coe et al., 2014). Promoting success, including proactively highlighting success to parents and carers, will also improve pupil-teacher relationships as these are based on repeated interactions over time (Wubbels et al., 2014).\n\n### Supporting pupils to develop effective learning behaviours\n\nSupporting success in this way also leads to pupils exhibiting more effective approaches to their learning. For example:****\n\n- **Increased effort and confidence:** Pupils’ perception of their ability, their expectations of future success and the extent to which they value an activity, influence their motivation and persistence, making improved academic outcomes more likely. This may be particularly important for low-attaining pupils who may have had limited experiences of success in the past (Gutman & Schoon, 2013).\n- **Growing intrinsic motivation:** ‘Extrinsic’ rewards like praise for pupils who are willing to try a difficult task can be useful to get pupils started. However, where pupils are motivated ‘intrinsically’ by their own goals (and the believe they can achieve them), pupils will be more persistent in the long term (Lazowski & Hulleman, 2016).\n\nIn sum, success over time supports the development of pupil effort, self-belief and intrinsic motivation which, in turn, drives further classroom success in a virtuous classroom cycle.\n\nMs Mahrez can also help pupils to understand and consciously cultivate these effective learning behaviours. Research suggests pupils can get better at self-regulating their behaviours and emotions (EEF, 2017), and pupils who do so are likely to attain more highly and succeed in the future (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). For example, if pupils can identify the behaviours that underpin their success (such as perseverance), they can regulate emotional barriers (like impatience) that can prevent them from being successful. This makes it more likely they stay on task, which is a strong predictor of successful learning (Muijs & Reynolds, 2010).\n\nFinally, pupils are influenced by the goals, values and behaviours of classmates (IES, 2008; Rathmann et al., 2018). Over time, individual pupils adopting effective behaviours can also create a classroom climate that promotes success for their peers.\n\n### The long-term impacts of high teacher expectations\n\nMs Mahrez is aware that her expectations are important for classroom behaviour (IES, 2008) and learning (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). Teacher expectations influence whether pupils experience an effective classroom, where there is both the support and challenge to succeed at goals that stretch pupils (Coe et al. 2014). Also, teachers who add most value to academic outcomes also support pupil success beyond the classroom. Having an effective teacher, likely one who holds these high expectations, is also a factor making it more likely pupils will experience other forms of future success, including:\n\n- Attending university.\n- Earning a higher salary.\n- Avoiding having children as a teenager (Chetty, Friedman & Rockoff, 2014).\n\nPupils who perceive that their teachers are in control of the class and include them in activities are also more likely to feel satisfied in life and have better school outcomes (Rathmann et al., 2018). Moreover, lower-achieving pupils appear to benefit most from effective teaching (Slater et al., 2011). Ms Mahrez should be ambitious in her expectations for her pupils within her classroom. By developing her effectiveness as a teacher, she can be confident that she is also setting pupils up for wider success. In time, this should lead pupils to also have higher expectations of themselves.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nBeing an effective teacher requires strong knowledge of effective instruction and the subject being taught (Coe et al., 2014). Ms Mahrez needs to develop her practice in relation to the instruction and subject strands of this programme to have the best chance of translating high expectations into successful learning behaviours.\n\nConveying and upholding high expectations takes significant teacher effort and time. Improvements in pupil attitudes to learning may not be immediately visible, and there may be steps backwards as well as forwards. Ms Mahrez may feel like her colleagues’ classrooms work as if by magic, but she needs to understand there is no shortcut. Her consistent efforts to support pupil success, and helping them understand the process behind this, is the best way she can support pupils in her classroom and set them up for success beyond it.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      High expectations are achieved through learning environments which demand\n      lots from pupils but also ensure they experience success.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Experiencing success improves pupil effort, confidence and motivation.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupils can improve their self-regulation and so their behaviour and\n      learning.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Teachers who promote academic success also make pupil success beyond the\n      classroom more likely.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nChetty, R., Friedman, J.

By instruction, we mean anything that teachers\nand pupils do in the classroom that is meant to get them to learn. Getting instruction\nright is hard, but it often boils down to what teachers know, and how they put that\nknowledge into practice in their classrooms. The best teachers know their pupils,\nthey know what they're teaching, and they know how to help their pupils learn those\nthings.\n\nBut just knowing isn't enough. Great teachers put that knowledge into practice in their classrooms, they're continually assessing their pupils to see if they understand and they adapt all the time to help their pupils learn. So there's a lot there, but the evidence is pretty clear that people can become great at instruction and we've put a lot of thought into designing resources that are going to help you to keep getting better.\n\n<h3>Presenter: Melanie Hooson</h3>\nIt doesn't feel very controversial to say that effective instruction ensures that\npupils learn what we teach them. But what we mean by learning? Over the decades,\npsychologists have come up with various definitions of learning, but perhaps the\none that's most useful for teachers is this: learning involves a lasting change in\npupils' capabilities and understanding.\n\nWhen we understand the importance of getting pupils to remember what we teach them, it makes sense to think about how memory works. Memory is where pupils process and remember what we teach them, it is fundamental to learning and instruction. Getting to know how memory works will help teachers design instructional practices that help them to retain what we teach them in the long term. In other words, it will help pupils to learn.\n\nIf I wanted a teacher to understand how to teach in a way that will help pupils to learn, I would tell them to start with these three things. Number one: learn about a simple model of memory, including working memory and long-term memory. Number two: learn about how our memory stores information in mental models. And number three: learn about explicit teaching. This is a form of teaching that takes advantage of the strengths of how our memories work and reduces the impact of their limitations.\n\nMost of the experienced teachers I've worked with have had to identify the kind of practices that really help their pupils learn mostly through trial and error. I think the model of memory and learning are so central to developing as a new teacher because it will help you to fast track through those experiences and help your pupils to find success much more quickly than you would on your own.\n\n<h3>Presenter: Helena Moore</h3>\nIn this strand, you will explore the foundations of effective instruction and the\nlink to how pupils learn. You will consider how to guide pupils' learning via an\nexplicit teaching approach, and you will learn some specific strategies that can\nbe applied across a sequence of learning.\n\nEach module will include a weekly video. The purpose of the videos is to give you a broad understanding of the module and a concrete example of what some of the ideas look like in practice. The videos draw on the same research base as the evidence summaries and illustrate some of the action steps that you may encounter in your weekly coaching.\n\nOne thing to remember is that whilst the models in the video will show an aspect of what you learn about that week, they cannot show all of it. One example alone would never be enough to cover everything that the module does. To get the best out of these videos, pay attention to the key ideas that we highlight. It might be a different subject or phase to the one that you teach, but these videos have been carefully curated to ensure they demonstrate key ideas. These key ideas are relevant across all subjects and all phases.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I1.pdf){/button}\n\n## Read | Strand introduction\n\nWelcome to the _Instruction_ strand of the programme. This strand is composed of 12 modules and has been designed to last roughly a term. It is best completed during your second term as an NQT – typically the spring term.\n\nBy the end of this strand you will have an evidence-informed understanding of:\n\n- The link between effective instruction and pupil learning.\n- The elements of explicit instruction and the ‘I-We-You' model as a useful way of approaching this.\n- How instruction can support more effective pupil thinking.\n\nThis programme has been designed to ensure that teachers develop a holistic understanding of effective teaching so, while the Instruction strand is mostly about instruction, it also incorporates insights from Behaviour and Subject, as these are also important to support pupil learning. When we say ‘instruction’ we mean the combination of teaching and learning, rather than just teacher input. We therefore define instruction as “any activity that is intended to create learning” (Wiliam & Black, 2009).\n\nFurthermore, you’ll notice that as the strand progresses modules will often touch on previously learned content. This is intentional and a crucial aspect of your learning experience. Some concepts on the programme are so important that they need to be revisited multiple times, to ensure you develop a deep and durable understanding.\n\nThis strand comprises 12 modules sequenced to work through the foundations of effective instruction, its elements and how they support effective pupil learning, and then considers more complex instructional approaches.\n\n- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective instruction.\n- **Modules 2-3** cover the links between effective instruction and pupil learning.\n- **Modules 5-8** cover the elements of effective instruction and their links to an explicit teaching approach.\n- **Modules 8-12** explore more complex ideas around certain practices that can support even _more_ effective learning, incorporating and building on previous modules.\n\n### Making it work\n\nThe features of effective instruction can vary slightly depending on the subject(s), phase(s) or community you teach. In addition, there are some elements of instruction, like the school teaching and learning policy, that you will have limited control over. This is why it’s important that you work with subject and phase specialists in your school to help you identify the best ways to apply your learning. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to support. Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter, as well as seeking their assistance, challenge, feedback and critique, will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context.\n\nThe evidence cited in the strand draws primarily from research on:\n\n- Cognitive science.\n- Classroom practices of effective teachers.\n\nYou might have come across some of the terminology explored before. However, some of the technical language used, particularly around cognitive science, may be new to you. Several key terms are explored further in the evidence summary below.\n\n### A reminder of the programme pattern\n\nHaving worked through Behaviour, you will be familiar with how each week is structured. Instruction follows the same pattern for each module:\n\n- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.\n- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read, relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.\n- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.\n- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.\n\nYear one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF.\n\nNow that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.\n\n## I1 | Strand overview\n\n### Teaching challenge\n\nMs Brophy is increasingly confident in her behaviour management. She’s supported with pre-prepared schemes of work and lesson plans but sometimes struggles to make them work in her classroom. Pupils can become confused about what she wants them to do or struggle to remember what she has taught them. How can Ms Brophy make instructional decisions that maximise the learning of her class?\n\n### Key idea\n\nMaking effective instructional decisions help lessons to go better and pupils to learn more.\n\n### Evidence summary\n\n#### Learning\n\nLearning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. Ms Brophy wants to ensure that pupils are able to remember what they learn. She also wants her pupils to be able to think creatively and problem solve. To be successful, she needs to understand the foundational role of ‘memory’ in learning.\n\n#### A model of memory\n\nAn important factor in successful learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory. Willingham’s simple model of memory is one way to represent visually how the components relate to each other:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Daniel Willingham’s simple model of memory which shows how information from the environment is processed by the working memory (the site of awareness and thinking) to create changes to long-term memory (factual and procedural knowledge), whilst recognising that forgetting can also occur. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/diagram-1.png $EndURL $Caption Simple model of memory (Willingham, 2009) $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThe main components in this model are:\n\n- **Working memory** which acts as the conduit between the information we attend to in our environment and our long-term memory (Sweller, 2016). It is also where we hold information we are thinking about in the moment (Willingham, 2009). It has a limited capacity: we can only think about a few things (two or three) at once (Cowan, 2008).\n- **Long-term memory** which can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn. This store of knowledge integrates new ideas with existing knowledge. We can also draw on knowledge from our long-term memory to support the processing of new information in working memory (Willingham, 2009). The capacity of long-term memory is vast (Cowan, 2008).\n\n#### Mental models\n\nSimply giving pupils knowledge is not enough. Ms Brophy needs to make the knowledge useable, for example by connecting new knowledge to existing pupil knowledge. Mental models -- sometimes referred to as schema -- are how we all organise our knowledge. They are an internal representation of concepts (for example Earth) or a set of interrelated concepts (for example the circulatory system) (Chi, 2009). Mental models are subject and topic specific, so to be successful Ms Brophy will also need to consider how to develop and convey subject knowledge to her pupils in the Subject strand.\n\n#### Managing cognitive load\n\nTeachers can change pupils’ capabilities and understanding by increasing the knowledge in pupil long-term memory and constructing useful and well organised mental models (Sweller et al., 1998). However, when teaching, Ms Brophy notices that some of her pupils struggle when being introduced to new material. A key reason for this may be that their working memories are being overloaded.\n\nThe capacity of our working memory is limited. Complex activities that place a heavy burden on either processing or storage capacity can place excessive demands on working memory and are therefore likely overload the system, resulting in task failure (Gathercole et al., 2006). Cognitive load refers to the amount of effort needed to process information in working memory (Sweller et al., 1998). Teachers like Ms Brophy need to manage the cognitive load pupils experience so that they can learn efficiently. She needs to ensure pupils experience enough new material to learn effectively but not too much, otherwise pupils working memory will become overloaded. She can do this through the instructional decisions she makes.\n\n#### Drawing on prior knowledge\n\nOne way which Ms Brophy can manage the cognitive load her pupils experience is by drawing on their prior knowledge. The more prior knowledge pupils hold, the easier it is for them to process new information. Prior knowledge also plays a role in the development of their mental models, as pupils’ existing knowledge influences how new knowledge is stored and organised (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\nWhere prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions (Simonsmeier et al., 2018). This particularly applies if new ideas are not introduced in manageable steps. Ms Brophy knows that pupils will have different levels of prior knowledge and many will also hold misconceptions. On the other hand, as pupil knowledge develops, teachers needs to reduce the support pupils receive, as support can get in the way of pupils using existing knowledge (Sweller et al., 1998). Therefore, Ms Brophy will need to consider how much prior knowledge pupils have when making instructional decisions.\n\n#### Mitigating extraneous load\n\nBecause working memory has a limited capacity, Ms Brophy needs to be intentional in how she introduces and explains content to her pupils. Extraneous load refers to ways in which instruction can make processing information unhelpfully challenging for pupils (for example, giving complicated instructions to pupils who have limited prior knowledge, or redundant support to pupils who already have sufficient knowledge; Sweller, 2016). Ms Brophy can reduce extraneous load through the instructional decisions she makes.\n\n#### Explicit teaching\n\nAs we have seen, in order to ensure her pupils learn effectively, when making decisions about her instruction Ms Brophy needs to consider the limits of pupil memory. The knowledge Ms Brophy wants to teach is complex – in _Subject_ she will consider how to develop her subject knowledge and what habits might support her to plan her own lessons. Initially, she should work with her mentor to get shared schemes of work and lesson plans to help her to identify and sequence relevant knowledge. For pupils to successfully learn this material, she needs to explicitly teach her pupils (Sweller, 2016).\n\n_Explicit teaching_ is a heavily ‘guided’ approach to orchestrating learning (EEF, 2017), in contrast to just letting pupils attempt to ‘discover’ new ideas by themselves. In general, less guided approaches to learning, such as discovery learning, have been shown to be ineffective (Coe et al., 2014). This doesn’t mean the teacher simply tells or lectures pupils; it can also include activities and discussion, as long as the relevant information is explicitly provided and practised. Successful explicit teaching breaks down learning, and provides pupils with the support needed to think successfully about content by taking into account:\n\n- The limits of working memory.\n- The complexity of the material to be taught.\n- The prior knowledge that pupils have.\n\n#### I-We-You\n\nOne suggested way to implement explicit teaching is to follow an ‘I do’, ‘We do’ then ‘You do’ approach (Lemov, 2015). I-We-You is a rule of thumb Ms Brophy can use to make decisions about her instruction. It involves reducing support over time so that pupils can increasingly access content independently. Fundamental to effective instruction is maintaining a high success rate while reducing this support as pupils’ knowledge increases (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n#### ‘I do’\n\nThe ‘I do’ refers to the early stages of learning where the teacher provides new information by modelling and/or explaining the facts and processes which pupils are to learn. Effective teachers ensure that pupils acquire, rehearse and connect knowledge by providing a good deal of instructional support. Pupils can go on to more independent activities but only after basic material is learned (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nThere are numerous ways Ms Brophy’s ‘I do’ can explicitly convey content, including:\n\n- Explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n- Explaining new concepts (such explanations are less effective for processes: Wittwer & Renkl, 2010).\n- Introducing materials in steps.\n- Modelling new processes and ideas (Rosenshine, 2012).\n- Providing concrete examples and worked examples of new problems (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\nThere are a variety of instructional strategies Ms Brophy can use to support her pupils when introducing new material. These supports are referred to as scaffolds. A scaffold is a temporary aid used to support pupils with their learning (Rosenshine, 2012). Just as with scaffolds around a house, they help us to reach areas which on our own we would struggle to get to. Once they have served their purpose, however, it is important they are removed.\n\n#### ‘We do’\n\nThe ‘We do’ is the ‘guided practice’ part of instruction where pupils gradually complete examples with less and less support on more and more of the task.\n\nMs Brophy has introduced her new material in small steps and provided scaffolds, such as modelling or worked examples, to support her pupils’ thinking. Because pupils learn at different rates and have different levels of prior knowledge, Ms Brophy knows that they will require different levels and types of targeted support.\n\nShe wants her pupils to grasp foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on. Questioning is an important tool for teachers to master which can be used to foster thinking and check pupil understanding (Coe et al., 2014). Furthermore, it can enable teachers to be responsive and better target support to pupils who are struggling (Black & Wiliam, 2009). Once she has used questioning to identify pupils, Ms Brophy could give more targeted input or regroup them so she can better support them.\n\n#### ‘You do’\n\nThe ‘You do’ is the ‘independent practice’ part of the lesson, where pupils practise tasks of increasing difficulty on their own.\n\nOver time, Ms Brophy wants to ensure that she provides her pupils with regular purposeful practice and the opportunity to retrieve information from memory. Practice is essential, but not all practice is equal (Deans for Impact, 2015). She needs to ensure her pupils think hard and provide enough scaffolding and feedback to ensure they achieve a high success rate (Rosenshine, 2012). Practice could be even more effective if it includes:\n\n- Spacing so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap.\n- Low-stakes quizzes to retrieve key content (Pashler et. al, 2007).\n\nEffective practice supports automaticity and overlearning where pupils can complete tasks fluently without drawing on their working memory, freeing them to focus on more complex tasks (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, learning their times tables allows pupils to grapple with more complex long multiplication and division. Therefore, pupils need to practise beyond the point where they get something right to the point when they can no longer get it wrong.\n\n#### Homework\n\nHomework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils. But to be effective it needs to be of high quality and relevant to what is being taught in class (EEF, 2018). Considering the link to the instructional sequence above could increase the chance of homework being successful. For example, asking pupils to do further practise of something which has been taught in class, or perhaps reading with a parent to introduce a new idea that will be built upon in class. Making the purpose of the homework clear to pupils, ensuring that pupils have the resources to complete homework independently or that parents have the capacity to support homework effectively, are also likely to increase chances of success. It is also important that pupils get feedback on their homework. On the other hand, regular homework unconnected to class learning is less likely to be effective (EEF, 2018).\n\n#### Refining instruction\n\nAs Ms Brophy improves at explicit teaching and develops her subject knowledge, various strategies can further refine her instructional decision making:\n\n|                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Questioning** | Effective instruction checks for understanding and extends pupil thinking (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Brophy can refine her questioning to ensure she gets quality answers from her pupils, helping her to decide whether to revisit content or go deeper into topics.                                                                                                           |\n| **Talk**        | Pupils can refine their understanding and gain new insights from their knowledge through effective peer talk (Jay et al. 2017; Kirschner et al., 2018). Ms Brophy needs to check whether pupils have enough knowledge to talk effectively and use her instruction to facilitate successful talk.                                                                            |\n| **Feedback**    | Good quality feedback is one the best-evidenced and most effective ways to improve pupil progress (EEF, 2018). Ms Brophy needs to practise ‘decision-driven data collection’: considering what kind of feedback she has the capacity to give and pupils have the capacity to act upon, and how she can do this in a way which supports pupils to manage their own learning. |\n\nThroughout the* Instruction* strand Ms Brophy needs to keep two questions in mind:\n\n- How can my instructional decisions best support pupil learning?\n- How can I best support a high pupil success rate?\n\n#### Nuances and caveats\n\nA common misconception is that I-We-You should only be used in individual lessons. In fact, I-We-You can be used several times within a lesson, or spread over longer instructional sequences.\n\n$I\n\n<h4>Key takeaways</h4>\nMs Brophy can make better instructional decision by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Learning is a lasting change in pupil capabilities and understanding - if\n    nothing is remembered, nothing has been learned.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instruction takes pupil working and long-term memory into account.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instruction involves explicitly teaching the knowledge and skills\n    pupils need in small steps, ensuring a high success rate.

But in order to make sense of these\nprinciples and be able to use them well, teachers need to have a detailed understanding\nof what they are teaching. Before we think about how to teach, we need to know what\nto teach. And the first step in instruction is to identify the learning content.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nPupils need to think hard about something in order to learn it and lesson time is\nprecious. Teachers need to have a clear understanding of what they want their pupils\nto think about. And this is what we mean by identifying the learning content.\n\nIdentifying the learning content involves identifying what you want your pupils to know and be able to do at the end of the sequence of learning. Once you have this clear and specific idea of what pupils need to learn, you can check to see what content pupils may already know or may have misconceptions about. Clarity over learning content can make teaching easier and increases the likelihood of success.\n\nThere are several ways you might identify learning content. One approach is to look at the learning goals and use your own knowledge of the subject to break this down into more granular pieces of content. If a lesson objective or intention states that pupils should learn about the foundations of ancient Rome, what specific content sits within this? You might say, <em>\"I want my pupils to know that ancient Rome was founded on the banks of the River Tiber.”</em> Another approach is to complete the task that pupils would do at the end of a sequence of learning. For example, write a paragraph, giving your opinion on whether the opening of a multinational fast-food chain had a positive or negative impact on Nigeria. Or if you're in an earlier setting, you might want pupils to use a range of vocabulary to talk about the different farmyard animals during small world play. Once you have this concrete example, you can unpack the knowledge and skills that are required. You might identify more specific words to introduce to pupils so that they can add them to their play. Words like snout or trotter. Completing and unpicking a task is likely to reveal some content that pupils already have and some content that is going to be new to them.\n\nLesson objectives, units of work, and the national curriculum can be helpful in guiding you about what to teach, but the knowledge and skills required will change depending on the content that you're teaching and who you are teaching. Completing tasks allows teachers to see the specific details that sit within them. Think about this objective:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Which is bigger 3/7 or 5/7?</li>\n  <li>Which is bigger 5/7 or 5/9?</li>\n</ol>\nWhat specific knowledge and skills do they require? These tasks appear similar, but\nwhen you break them down, you see that they require different knowledge and skills.\nIn the first, pupils will need to know about fractions with a shared denominator,\nalong with other foundational content about number. In the second, pupils will need\nto know about fractions with different denominators. Teachers need to know the detail\nof what they are teaching so that they can pinpoint what it is that pupils need to\nlearn.\n\nOnce you've identified what you want your pupils to learn in a lesson, it is important to check that what you're asking of them is manageable. Teachers can make learning manageable by ensuring they build on what pupils already know, break content down into smaller chunks, or identify the essential idea within more complex concepts, being wary of embedding misconceptions when they do this.\n\nHaving thought really carefully about what pupils will be learning in the lesson, teachers then need to design a way of quickly assessing for it. An exit task is one effective way of doing this. A good exit task tests for the most important content within a lesson. Pupils need to be able to complete it quickly, and teachers should be able to assess it quickly. It can't assess all the content in the lesson. Instead, it should focus on the content that pupils need to learn before they move on. The better teachers identify the learning content of the lesson, the better they will know what to test for.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, we're going to see an early career teacher working with their\ncoach. It is a primary setting and the teacher is preparing a lesson of the year\nsix class. The unit of work is rainforests and the teacher's preparing a lesson about\nwhere the Amazon rainforest is located. As you listen, pay particular attention to\nhow the teacher and the coach do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identify the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the\n    subject\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>\n<em>\n  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So in this lesson, we want pupils to learn about\n  where the Amazon rainforest is located. And we can see it's the third lesson\n  in the unit about rainforests and pupils should be building their\n  understanding of what a rainforest is.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So this unit is all about understanding why rainforests matter, which links to\n  that key theme of sustainability that they've been learning about from year\n  one to year six. Pupils need that really strong understanding of what the\n  rainforest is if they're to understand why the rainforest is so important and\n  some of those threats to the rainforest such as deforestation.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The end of lesson task, we can see, is to mould sourdough in the shape of the\n  Amazon rainforest over a map of South America. The aim is to get pupils to\n  really understand how big the rainforest is and to know which countries it\n  covers. They then have to place a cocktail stick with the name of the country,\n  into the sourdough on the map, in the correct place. They're then going to\n  mark where the Amazon river flows into the sourdough.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I know you've read the scheme of work really carefully, and you've completed\n  the end of lesson task. So now let's get a bit more specific. What knowledge\n  and skills do you need pupils to know by the end of the lesson?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT (PAULA DELANEY): So by the end of the lesson, I want pupils to be able to\n  name the Amazon river. I want them to know the countries where the Amazon\n  rainforest is located. I want them to really understand the size of the\n  rainforest as well. And skills wise, I want them to be able to read the Atlas.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n   COACH: Great you've listed lots of important content, I would add that pupils\n  need to know the Amazon rainforest is located in nine different countries and\n  know some of their names. To make it manageable, focus first on these three\n  countries: Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela as this is where the majority of\n  the Amazon rainforest is located. You will also need pupils to know some of\n  the core knowledge about the rainforest. So you need them to know if it's\n  close to the equator line, the climate's hot and humid, there's lots of\n  rainfall and that it's a habitat for lots of plants and animals. This is what\n  pupils have been learning about in previous lessons so it should be part of\n  their prior knowledge. As for the skills let's break down the scale of reading\n  an Atlas into something a little bit more specific. So reading an Atlas can\n  involve lots of different things. Could you be more specific?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Yes, I want them to be able to locate certain countries in the map.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n   COACH: Great, we could go further and add that we want pupils to be able to\n  locate a compass on a map and use compass points to locate a country. We could\n  just tell pupils that on an Atlas, the top of the page is always North. But in\n  year one, they learn those four compass points, so it'd be good for them to\n  have a chance to recall and strengthen that knowledge.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  This is a really detailed list of knowledge and skills that we've got. What do\n  you think the most important knowledge is that they need to take away from the\n  lesson?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Essentially, I really want them to see how big the Amazon rainforest is\n  and how many people's lives are actually impacted by it.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Definitely, so first, pupils will learn what the rainforest is and then\n  they'll build upon that knowledge to learn about deforestation, which is that\n  key issue within the theme of sustainability. This lesson gives pupils a\n  concrete opportunity to see how big the Amazon rainforest is. They'll build\n  upon this in future lessons when they explore how many people the Amazon\n  rainforest supports, why deforestation is a problem and why sustainability\n  matters.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  If pupils don't understand how big the rainforest is, they'll find it hard to\n  understand deforestation and sustainability. This is one of the most important\n  things they'll need to take away from the lesson. So you'll need to draw their\n  attention to it and check they've really understood it.\n</em>\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nIn this example, the teacher and that coach spent the majority of their time\nidentifying, in detail, the essential concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils\nneeded to learn in a lesson. The lesson was precise and concrete. The Amazon\nrainforest is close to the equator. It's located in nine different countries.\nThey also made sure that the learning was manageable by building on what pupils\nalready knew. In this case, about what a rainforest is. And they broke down some\ncontent into smaller chunks: being able to locate a country on a map rather than\nthe larger scale of being able to read an atlas.\n\nThey used knowledge of the unit of work to know what the really important content was, like the size of the Amazon rainforest, and they prioritised content that would help pupils to achieve the end goals of the unit. In this case, understanding why rainforests matter. Having thought really hard about what they were teaching, the teacher was able to identify what content they would test for at the end of the lesson fairly quickly.\n\nThe time that the teacher and their coach spent in identifying the learning content is likely to speed up the rest of their planning and make their lesson more effective.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIdentifying the learning content means thinking hard about what you're teaching.\nHow much time do you currently spend on this? Before we finish, remind yourself of\nthe key ideas that we've covered in this video. Which of these ideas will you focus\non first?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identify essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject\n    you are teaching.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Provide opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical\n    components.\n  </li>\n  <li>Plan formative assessment tasks linked to lesson tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nIdentifying the learning content is a rewarding task, but it's demanding too. We\noften underestimate the knowledge and skills required and it can be especially\ndifficult if you haven't taught the lesson or unit before. I'd highly recommend\ndoing this task with someone who knows the content and the subject well.\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I2.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Stones wants to ensure pupils experience maximum learning in each lesson. She knows she needs to challenge pupils with new learning content but is unsure how to decide the right amount of content to do this. How could she identify and divide up content, and check if learning is taking place? How can she adapt others' plans for her own classes to achieve this?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can ensure pupils experience maximum learning by carefully identifying the content that pupils will think hard about at different points in a lesson, breaking this thinking down and checking learning along the way.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Identifying key thinking in a lesson\n\nLearning involves processes leading to a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding – if nothing changes, arguably nothing has been learned (Sweller, 2016). As time in lesson is limited, Ms Stones needs to prioritise a manageable amount of content for her pupils to learn about. Learning takes place when pupils think hard about something (Coe, 2013) so Ms Stones should consider and carefully specify what she wants her pupils to think hard about in each lesson.\n\n### Breaking down learning\n\nLike all of us, pupils find new academic ideas difficult, and will often avoid thinking hard wherever possible (Willingham, 2009). Pupils may also avoid tasks where they fear they will be unsuccessful (Kluger & deNisi, 1996). Ms Stones can help her pupils by breaking learning down, making thinking more manageable.\n\nWhen learning is manageable, pupils will achieve a higher success rate. Effective teachers break learning down to make it more manageable by:\n\n- Introducing new material in small steps.\n- Sharing models (including solved problems) to illustrate each step.\n- Asking lots of questions and guiding pupils to practise each step successfully.\n\nTo support a high success rate, instruction should be aligned at different stages of teaching. For example, making sure that pupils practise the same material that has been introduced to them (Rosenshine, 2012). Therefore, when selecting the content pupils must think hard about, Ms Stones needs to consider, ”what thinking do I want pupils to be successful with?” and ”how can I break this thinking down to make success more likely?”\n\nHowever, selecting appropriate steps is hard. Sometimes a step that will improve a final performance does not look like the final performance (Christodoulou, 2017). For example, a violinist might practise their scales to be fluent before attempting to improve at playing a piece, rather than just repeating the piece. Similarly, pupils might need to practise their vocabulary before attempting an essay. Ms Stones should seek support from her mentor and colleagues when breaking learning down into essential material – concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – that she wishes pupils to think about and remember.\n\nMs Stones wants to support a high success rate, so she also needs to understand how manageable pupils are finding the steps she has selected. However, predicting how manageable steps are can be uncertain. For example, how manageable a step is can depend on pupil prior knowledge (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, even if Ms Stones has carefully broken learning down, with support from colleagues, she still needs to assess pupils to check how successful they have been with each step.\n\n### Checking key learning\n\nEffective teachers regularly review learning, asking lots of questions which check pupil understanding (Rosenshine, 2012). The more precisely Ms Stones has identified what she wants pupils to be thinking hard about at various stages of the lessons, the more effectively she will be able to check for key learning. She needs to check the learning of as many pupils as possible.\n\nMs Stones wants to establish where all learners are in relation to the key content or steps she wants pupils to succeed at. An effective strategy for checking whole-class understanding of identified content is the use of ‘exit tickets’. This is an end of lesson assessment that pupils need to be able to complete quickly and that teachers should be able to assess quickly. Getting every pupil to complete an exit ticket as a low-stakes assessment at the end of her lessons will help Ms Stones to gauge how successful pupils have been with these steps.\n\nMs Stones’ assessment may pick up that pupils are not yet secure in their thinking about a particular step, for example if several pupils incorrectly answer a question or there is a common misconception or error in an exit ticket. If the success rate drops, Ms Stones should provide further support, for example breaking the learning steps down further in the next lesson.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nOne approach to breaking learning down could be to set steps which pupils can already easily do, to ensure success. However, setting easy work might suggest the teacher has low expectations, which is likely to negatively affect pupil confidence and motivation (Coe et al., 2014). Furthermore, if pupils are not set challenging enough tasks, they will not learn as much.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Stones can deliver more effective instruction by identifying the learning content\nif she understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Learning is a process leading to changes in pupils' capabilities or\n    understanding that happens when pupils think hard.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Breaking learning down should make thinking manageable enough for pupils to\n    experience a high success rate.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Identifying manageable steps is tricky, so teachers should check all pupils’\n    key learning, and provide further support to ensure a high success rate.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nRosenshine, B.

The good news is that we know a lot\nabout how learning works and the role that memory plays. Memory is an important factor\nin learning. It affects our ability to pay attention to something, to remember it,\nand to use it. Teachers need to know about the role that memory plays in learning\nand design lessons that maximize its potential.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nUnderstanding a bit about how our memories work can help us to make better decisions\nin our teaching. Whilst there's still a lot that we don't know, cognitive scientists\nhave learned a huge amount about how our brains process and store information. Teachers\nneed to know this too. The following simple model of memory, devised by Professor\nof Psychology, Daniel Willingham, can tell us a lot about how learning works.\n\nThe model starts with the environment. There are thousands of things in the environment that you could pay attention to. You might pay attention to the sound of my voice. You might hear a noise outside. You might notice your mobile phone, but you can only pay attention to a small number of things at once. And it's only the small number of things that you pay attention to that enter into your working memory. Working memory is where conscious, effortful thinking takes place, and we use our working memory all of the time. If I gave you some numbers to add up in your head, you'd have to hold onto one number whilst adding on the other. You'd be using your working memory. But working memory has a very limited capacity. It can only hold onto around four chunks of information at once, and if you bombard working memory with too much information, it can't hold onto it. But assuming you've paid attention to something, and your working memory has been able to process the information, it should lay down a trace in your long-term memory. And this trace is the beginning of a change in long-term memory, and learning is a change in your long-term memory.\n\nBut long-term memory doesn't just sit there passively, it's not like files gathering dust in a filing cabinet. It actively supports your working memory when you're trying to learn new information. What you have in your long-term memory helps you to hold onto more information in your working memory. It also helps you to know what to pay attention to. If you know the recipe for spaghetti carbonara, then you'll be able to spot the ingredients in your cupboard more easily when you see them.\n\nOne important thing to bear in mind is that we easily forget information. Within minutes or hours, we will lose the detail of the new information that we've learned, so we need lots of opportunities to come back to it, to actively retrieve that information from our long-term memory, so that we can make the information stick.\n\nNow that we've established a basic understanding of how memory works, we can think about how we might teach in a way that helps to overcome its limitations and harness its strengths. To begin with, we can support working memory by drawing on prior knowledge; drawing on information in our long-term memory, like knowledge of words or of number, frees up capacity in our working memory. This is one of the reasons why it's useful to get pupils to commit some foundational knowledge to their long-term memory first.\n\nAnother strategy is to think about our exposition. This is the part of the lesson where we introduce new content. When teaching new content, we need to avoid introducing too much material at once and break the material down into manageable chunks. This will reduce the strain on the capacity of our working memory. We also need to remove any unhelpful distractions, like unnecessary classroom noise or redundant words in our instructions. The capacity of our working memory is limited, and anything that gets in the way of pupils' thinking about what we need them to will only make it harder for them. Some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience particular difficulties linked with working memory, and so strategies that reduce the strain on working memory may be especially helpful.\n\nNext we need to give pupils plenty of opportunities to practise when learning new content. Effective practice gets pupils to think hard about their learning. It helps pupils to commit new content to their long-term memories, and therefore, remember it. Finally, retrieving content from our long-term memory helps to make it stick. This doesn't just mean revisiting previously taught content time and again. Instead it means providing opportunities for pupils to draw up information from their long-term memory. Asking pupils a question or a quick low-stakes quiz can be an effective way of doing this.\n\nGetting the balance right between exposition, practice, and retrieval isn't easy. No formula exists about how long to spend on each. The time spent on exposition, practice, and retrieval will vary depending on your pupils' prior knowledge and what it is that you're teaching. Understanding how pupils learn and adapting your teaching to meet this is an important part of high-quality teaching. Ensuring high-quality teaching is an effective approach for all pupils, including those with special educational needs and disabilities. However, some pupils with special educational needs and disabilities may need additional support on top of the high-quality teaching. Teachers should work closely with the SENCo in their school and other support staff, such as teaching assistants, to ensure that they tailor their instruction to specific needs of some pupils.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn a moment, you're going to watch an Ambition Institute coach model a sequence of\nlearning to a year one class. As you watch, focus on how they do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Breaks complex material into small steps.</li>\n  <li>\n    Balances exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical\n    knowledge and skills.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>\nIn this model, I'm going to show you a sequence of learning that's aligned with\nwhat we understand about how memory and learning work. For context, imagine that\nI'm teaching a year one class how to form the lowercase letter m. They already\nknow what an m looks like and have practiced forming it in reception, but in\nyear one, pupils need to refine their handwriting and make it much more\naccurate.\n\n<em>\n  “The sound we're going to be working on in handwriting today is, mm. Mm.\n  Great. Now in a minute, I'm going to show you an example of how we form the\n  lowercase letter m. Now in reception, we knew it as, down Maisie mountain\n  mountain, but in year one, we need to be a bit more specific. That means, we\n  need to be thinking about what m looks like, and how we are forming our m.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Let me show you how I would do it. I want you to pay really close attention to\n  where I place my pen. This will help you be really accurate when you have a go\n  on your own. [Teacher constantly checks pupils are watching as she models]{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I'm going to start Maisie on the top of this middle line, and I'm start by\n  going straight down, straight, straight down, and then back up. And I'm going\n  to start my mountain at Maisie's shoulder. [Teacher gestures to her shoulder] {\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I'm going to go round the mountain and straight down, straight, straight down.\n  Oh, I like that.  And then I'm going to go straight back up, and I need to\n  make sure my mountains are the same size, here, the same size. [Teacher points\n  at letter on white board]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  And I'm going to go back round again and down. And at the end, I'm going to\n  have a little bit of grass. Wow. I'm really happy with that.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Did you see how long it took me? It took me a really long time. Now I want you\n  to tell me what to do.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>Okay. So, what do I do first?</em>\n\n<em>[Pupils answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n   Yep, I go straight down, straight, straight, straight down, and then back up.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>And where do I stop Maisie's mountain? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupils answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Her shoulder, brilliant. I go around and down and then back up. What size do\n  the mountains have to be?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupils answer]</em>\n\n<em>Same size, yep, same size. Can you see that they're the same size? </em>\n\n<em>\n  And then I go back down, and what do I have to have at the end? A little bit\n  of grass.”\n</em>\n\nIn the short sequence of learning, I made sure that my teaching was aligned with what we know about memory in several ways. Firstly, I built on pupils' prior knowledge by linking to what they already know about the letter m. In this case, what sound it makes. Because during phonics lessons, pupils learn to associate a sound with a written letter, so hearing this should help them recall what the lowercase letter looks like. Having brought this image to mind, they can focus their attention on how I form the letter.\n\nDuring my exposition, where I modelled how to form the letter, I took steps to focus pupils' attention on the most important things. I want to ensure that their working memories are processing the most important information. I broke the model down into specific manageable steps that the pupils need to take, like drawing a straight line down, stopping at a point 2/3 of the line, which is equivalent to Maisie's shoulder. Breaking the task down into component parts helps pupil to focus their attention. It provides a mental equivalent of the dotted outlines that they have practised using before.\n\nI was also regularly checking to ensure that all pupils were on task, looking at me as I modelled, because I know that any low-level disruption can really get in the way of their thinking. And it helped that I was writing on a sheet of blank paper. There was nothing to distract them from watching me form the letter.\n\nFinally, I provided lots of opportunities for pupils to practise, to help pupils commit the key learning to their long-term memories. During my model, I asked them to tell me how to form the letter, saying the key steps out loud, straight line down, straight line down, mountains the same size. It helps pupils to develop an inner teacher voice that they can use when working independently. It also meant that I could check to see if pupils knew these key steps before setting them off on their own. Pupils then had plenty of time to practise independently, and during this time, I was able to carefully check their work to make sure that they were not practising mistakes. I know that what they think about is what they will learn.\n\nEven in this short sequence of learning, there are many ways in which I was able to take instruction for memory into account, making it more likely that pupils will be able to access and remember what I teach them.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've explored what we mean by instruction for memory and looked at\nsome practical ways in which teachers can assure that their instruction is aligned\nwith how pupils learn.

However, despite 'covering' the content in lessons, he still finds that many of his pupils struggle to remember it in future lessons. What can Mr Alexander do to help his pupils remember what they have been taught?\n\n## Key idea\n\nMemory plays an important role pupil learning. Teachers need to understand this and design instruction that is sensitive to the properties and limitations of memory to support remembering.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Pupils remember what they think about\n\nMemory plays an important role in pupil learning. Pupils use the store of knowledge in their long-term memory to make sense of new ideas and to help with higher order tasks like creativity and critical thinking (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, if pupils can’t remember what has been taught previously, we might say that they haven’t learnt it properly and, as a result, they are also unlikely to learn related new material or succeed at tasks that require higher order thinking. Mr Alexander needs to understand the link between memory and learning and adapt his instruction to make remembering more likely.\n\nMr Alexander’s pupils may be struggling to remember material he has ‘covered’ if too many new ideas have been taught too quickly, exceeding the capacity of pupil working memory (Willingham, 2009). When this happens pupils might experience ‘cognitive overload’.\n\nAttempt the tasks below:\n\n- First try to work out in your head the sum 4 x 7.\n- Now try to work out in your head the sum 14 x 273.\n\nBoth sums require the same process, but the second sum is more complicated and requires more items to be held in working memory, causing cognitive overload for most people. We learn what we have thought hard about (Coe, 2013). However, when working memory is overloaded like this, pupils are unable to think sufficiently about any of the material and are therefore unlikely to be able to remember it. Some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience particular challenges linked to working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006) and are therefore likely to require additional or adapted support to successfully access material (Willingham, 2009). Conversations with colleagues, families and pupils may support teachers to identify effective strategies.\n\n### Supporting pupil thinking\n\nMr. Alexander can support pupils to remember taught material by ensuring his instruction supports effective thinking. The capacity of pupil working memory is limited to a few items; the exact number depends on pupil prior knowledge and the items’ complexity (Cowan, 2008). Mr Alexander can support pupil thinking by explicitly linking new material to what has previously been learned and ensuring small steps are used (Rosenshine, 2012). If these steps are the right size, pupils can properly process new information and integrate it into their existing mental models.\n\nHere are two approaches to introducing new material in ways that minimise overloading pupil working memory:\n\n- **Worked examples:** Showing all the steps of a process (for example long multiplication in sum two above) enables pupils to attend to one step at a time.\n- **Partially worked examples**: For example, completing the first step of the problem for pupils helps them focus on, and think more deeply about, fewer parts of the problem (Sweller et al., 1998).\n\nHowever, as pupil knowledge develops, the support which initially helped pupils can get in the way of them using their growing knowledge (Sweller et al., 1998). For example, an explanation of a diagram might help a novice but may distract a pupil who already has the knowledge to interpret the same diagram. So, Mr Alexander gradually needs to remove support as pupil expertise increases.\n\nThe I-We-You model can be a useful approach to gradually removing support (Lemov, 2015):\n\n- **‘I do’**: Pupils need direct input to have enough knowledge to avoid their working memory becoming overloaded.\n- **‘We do’**: Pupils complete a worked or partially worked example using this knowledge, with teacher support.\n- **‘You do’**: Only when he has checked pupils can complete examples successfully with minimal support should Mr Alexander move to independent pupil practice.\n\n### Retrieval for memory over time\n\nHaving supported pupils to think successfully about new material, Mr Alexander needs to help pupils remember material over time. We have known for 100 years that without revisiting learning, people forget most material covered within a few days (Ebbinghaus, 1885 in Cowan, 2008).\n\nA powerful way Mr Alexander can support pupils to remember learning is to get them to regularly ‘retrieve’ material covered. Retrieval is the act of recalling information from memory and is beneficial in itself because it helps to 'cement the information to memory’ and makes forgetting less likely (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\nRetrieval is most powerful when pupils have begun to forget material, as this makes pupils think harder when retrieving, strengthening their memories. So, to be most effective, retrieval practice should be spaced out over time (Pashler et al., 2007). For example, Mr Alexander could return to material in a few days and then a few weeks to support his pupils to remember it most successfully.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nOne challenge some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities may experience is limited working memory capacity (Gathercole et al., 2006). So, supporting pupil thinking may in itself support these pupils to be successful. However, pupils may have other barriers so teachers should always take care to find out about specific barriers (e.g. visual impairment) and support strategies (e.g. large font copy of class materials).\n\nIndividual differences may mean retrieval practice is not equally powerful for all pupils. Factors that affect the impact of retrieval practice on pupil memory include the intervals between teaching and recall, and whether feedback on pupil responses is provided (Agarwal et al., 2017).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Alexander can ensure his instruction supports pupil memory by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Pupils remember content they think hard about, and they can’t think if their\n    working memory is overloaded.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can support thinking by introducing material which builds on prior\n    knowledge, breaking it up into manageable steps and using worked and\n    partially worked examples.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    As pupil knowledge increases, support can get in the way of thinking and\n    should be removed.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Opportunities to retrieve at increasingly spaced intervals promotes\n    remembering.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nPashler, H., Bain, P.

Each of them enters the classroom with their own\npre-existing knowledge base, drawn from lots of different sources: their experiences,\ntheir prior learning, their interests and their values. And this prior knowledge\nplays an important role in pupil learning. It helps pupils to make sense of what\nthey learn, and to remember in the long term. Teachers need to understand why prior\nknowledge matters, identify what prior knowledge their pupils have, and know how\nto use it in their teaching.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nPrior knowledge matters a lot. Firstly, prior knowledge helps pupils to make sense\nof what they're learning about. If a pupil reads a text about football and they already\nknow a lot about the topic, they will find it easier to access and understand. Secondly,\nif we want pupils to remember what they learn and be able to use it in the future,\nit needs to be connected to existing knowledge.\n\nIn order to take advantage of prior knowledge, teachers first need to identify what relevant prior knowledge pupils do and do not have, and then decide what to do about it. This may include identifying gaps in prior knowledge. Another way of thinking about prior knowledge is as a mental model. When we ask what prior knowledge pupils have, we're asking, what might their existing mental model of the content look like? What knowledge might it contain? How well connected is that knowledge? And what gaps or misconceptions might that be?\n\nOnce teachers have a better understanding of what their pupils do and do not know, they can use it to inform and adapt their teaching. They can help pupils to recall prior knowledge and point out to pupils how what they're learning is connected to what they know. Where prior knowledge of content is weak, teachers can use other strategies to help their pupils to access what they're learning. Like reducing the amounts of new content introduced at one time, breaking down the learning into small steps and using concrete examples. And if teachers identify misconceptions in pupils' knowledge, they can plan to address these errors. For example, many pupils hold a misconception that things that are heavy sink. Knowing that this is a misconception in advance, a teacher might choose to bring in a heavy object that will float.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that transferring what we know from one discipline to a new, unfamiliar context can be difficult. Just because pupils know how to analyse a historical source, doesn't mean they'll be able to apply the same skills when analysing a poem. The most useful prior knowledge to build on will be that which is closest to the subject specific content that you are teaching.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the following example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model how they\nmight build on pupil prior knowledge, during a starter activity. As you watch, pay\nparticular attention to how they do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Plans to connect new content with pupils’ existing knowledge</li>\n  <li>Links what pupils already know to what is being taught</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>\nIn this example I'm going to model how we can use the starter activity to\nconnect new knowledge with pupils' existing knowledge. I want you to imagine I'm\nteaching a year eight History lesson about how religion changed during the reign\nof Edward VI, the youngest son of Henry VIII. They've just completed a starter\nactivity, where they retrieved relevant prior knowledge about the life of Henry\nVIII, such as identifying his children, their age and their religion. They've\nbeen asked to hypothesise what impact the children's religion may have on Tudor\nEngland in the future. There are clear and established routines in the classroom\nfor completing stater activities. And pupils complete this work in silence. I'm\ngoing to begin my model, having just gathered responses to starter activity.\n\n<em>\n  “So we've just recalled the names of Henry VIII's children, and some of the\n  details about them, including their religion. Today, we're going to be\n  discussing what happened to religion in Tudor England after Henry VIII died.\n  Some of you have already hypothesized what you think will happen to religion,\n  based on the different religions of Henry VIII's children. But first, we need\n  to figure out who's going to take control.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Who do you think is going to succeed to the throne, after Henry VIII dies? So\n  who will it be? Number one, Edward, Henry's youngest child, or will it be\n  number two? Mary, his eldest daughter. Show me on your hands in three, two,\n  one.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Teacher pauses and scans the class]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay. So lots of you have said, number two, Mary, the correct answer is\n  Edward. So let's work out why.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Thinking back, why did Henry VIII divorce Catherine of Aragon, his first wife.\n  Tom?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Exactly. Henry VIII didn't think that a girl was going be strong enough to\n  rule England. And at that time, male heirs took priority even if they had an\n  older sister. So, Edward becomes King after Henry VIII died.”\n</em>\n\nIn this model, I connected new content to pupils' existing knowledge. In the first instance, I planned a starter activity where pupils have to retrieve relevant prior knowledge about who Henry VIII's children were and their religion. As we review the responses to that activity, I could identify and address any gaps in this knowledge. I then made it clear to pupils that they would be able to use what they know about Edward VI to understand how and why religion changed during his reign. I'm helping them to see how their learning fits together.\n\nSecondly, I identified a potential misconception in their prior knowledge. In this example, pupils know that Edward VI was the younger son. But typically, they tend to think that it is the eldest child who succeeds to the throne. I asked a direct question to check for this misconception and then gave the correct answer with a clear explanation about why it was right. Thinking about what pupils already know helps me to identify what knowledge will help them in understanding new learning. As well as anything that might get in the way of it.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nThis video has given you an overview of the importance of identifying and building\non pupils' prior knowledge.

She has noticed that many have gaps in prior knowledge, even if they have covered related topics in previous years, or the topic is one she taught them herself. Others struggle to link new ideas to their existing knowledge. How can she check and build upon pupil prior knowledge to help them understand new ideas?\n\n## Key idea\n\nPupil learning is more successful if teachers check, activate and build on pupil prior knowledge.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Prior knowledge helps us make sense of new material\n\n“The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner knows already” (Ausubel, 1968 in Simonsmeier et al., 2018). This is because pupils “come to understand new ideas by relating them to old ideas” (Willingham, 2009). Existing knowledge (stored in long-term memory) is what makes new ideas meaningful.\n\nWe can illustrate this by looking at sentences we might ask pupils to understand. As you read the sentences below, consider what pupils need to know to make sense of each one:\n\n1. To convert a decimal to a fraction, use place value.\n2. Two households, both alike in dignity,\n   In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\n   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\n   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\n3. Some say that Henry only made the break with Rome because the Pope would not let him have a divorce (Byrom et al., 1997).\n\nFor example, if pupils don’t know who Henry was, who the Pope was and why a divorce mattered to him, the sentence – and the topic – will make little sense.\n\nTeachers can help pupils to learn by linking new ideas to prior knowledge. This makes it easier to process those new ideas. For example, if pupils have studied stories about adventures previously, they know what to expect in encountering a new adventure story. This then makes it easier to remember them, by connecting the new ideas to existing knowledge. The greater pupils’ prior knowledge, the easier learning becomes for them: “it is easier to learn new information… [and] to solve new problems when one has a rich, well-connected body of knowledge and strong ties and connections” (Rosenshine, 2012). Well-organised prior knowledge makes it even easier for pupils to learn new ideas.\n\n### Weak prior knowledge can cause pupils to misunderstand\n\nFor prior knowledge to help pupils, it needs to be complete and accurate: if pupil prior knowledge is weak, pupils can misunderstand new material. If pupils hold misconceptions or lack correct knowledge, they can form misconceptions. For example, knowing that the surface of the Earth appears flat may lead pupils to conclude that the Earth is a disc (Simonsmeier et al., 2018). If Ms McShane tries to introduce a new idea which does not fit into a pupil’s current mental model – particularly if the pupil’s mental model is inaccurate – that pupil may misunderstand or reject this idea (Chi, 2009).\n\n### Activating prior knowledge can help pupils to succeed\n\nAn effective starting point for teachers is to identify what pupils already know, and any gaps in their knowledge. Having done so, Ms McShane can seek to introduce new material in small enough chunks to be comprehensible, and to make explicit links between prior knowledge and the new ideas. Where pupils have missing or incomplete knowledge, adding new concepts will help pupils to develop more sophisticated mental models. However, where Ms McShane’s pupils already hold beliefs which happen to be wrong, she must focus on changing old concepts (Chi, 2009). When introducing new material, Ms McShane needs to develop pupils’ mental models by taking small steps and posing lots of questions which explicitly link pupil prior knowledge with the concepts being taught.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nIf pupils have lots of prior knowledge and are reminded of this, it can prevent them from looking for new or better problem solutions (Simonsmeier et al., 2018) – like a driver going into autopilot: they stop thinking hard and therefore don’t develop their mental model.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs McShane can begin to improve her instruction by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Drawing on existing mental models helps us to learn new information and\n    solve new problems more effectively.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Weak prior knowledge can lead to misconceptions. Ms McShane must make the\n    effort to diagnose what her pupils do know, don’t know and misunderstand.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Ms McShane can build on this by reviewing pupil prior knowledge and\n    introducing new material in steps while asking lots of questions.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    By carefully activating pupil prior knowledge and challenging pupils’\n    incorrect beliefs, she can support pupils to develop accurate mental models.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nSimonsmeier, B.

To help with this, teachers can explicitly\nteach the knowledge and skills that pupils need to succeed. Exposition is the part\nof a lesson where the teacher can explicitly teach their pupils. This includes explaining,\nmodelling and demonstrating. Exposition provides an opportunity for teachers to set\nthings out clearly.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nExposition is the part of the lesson where the teacher carefully shares material\nwith pupils. Think of it as the I part, where I refers to the teacher sharing something\nwith their pupils. Our working memories, where conscious thinking takes place, have\na limited capacity and can become overloaded, especially when dealing with unfamiliar\ncontent. Good expositions support pupils to think by breaking knowledge down to steps,\nhighlighting key ideas, and building on what pupils already know.\n\nDepending on the content, teachers may want to choose between the following modes of delivery: explaining, modelling, or demonstrating. Different modes will suit different content.\n\nAn explanation is where we clearly tell students some information. This works well for explaining a concept. One approach is to give a carefully worded definition, and then a couple of examples. In a primary maths lesson, this might mean showing pupils an empty bottle of water and explaining that capacity is the amount that something can hold. In history, this might mean explaining what propaganda is followed by an example of a propaganda poster used in the first world war to encourage women into the workplace. Another approach is to use a concrete example, such as number blocks for visualizing tens and units. Teachers can use the concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts like addition.\n\nModelling is where we work through a process, articulating the steps and our thinking process as we go. In an English lesson, a teacher might tell pupils that a topic sentence introduces the main idea of a paragraph, and share their thought process out loud, like <em>\"I'm looking for the first sentence in the paragraph\"</em>, as they scan a paragraph on the white boards. Sometimes a visual representation of the concept or process that you're modelling helps pupils to understand the material.\n\nDemonstrating is where a teacher uses the physical object to show a process or a concept, such as how to use shade with charcoal pencils, or how to use a ray box, slit and lens to see how different surfaces refract light. As the teacher demonstrates, they draw our attention to the important features and the most relevant thought processes.\n\nTo be effective, expositions need to be carefully planned. At the planning stage, teachers can identify what they want pupils to know or be able to do. They need to do this in detail. One approach that can be helpful is to complete the following sentences:<em> “I want my pupils to know that...” </em>or <em>“I want my pupils to be able to...”  </em>Being granular and specific at this stage will improve the clarity of expositions.\n\nTeachers also need to ask themselves where their pupils' current starting point is. Expositions should build on what pupils already know. This will help them to access the content and link it to existing knowledge.\n\nFinally, teachers need to plan out what they say in advance. Scripting expositions is a good idea.\n\nTo get the best out of an exposition in the lesson itself, pupils need to think hard during it. To promote this, teachers can ask questions during the exposition. Questions can draw attention to the key features of the example, model or demonstration, and they can also check for pupil understanding.\n\nOverall, pupils shouldn't be passive during an exposition.  Instead, they need to think about the new content they are learning. Only then will they be able to use it independently, an important goal of good expositions and effective teaching.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn a moment, you'll see an Ambition Institute coach give an example of how to model\nduring an exposition. Pay particular attention to the following as you watch:\n<ul>\n  <li>Start expositions at the point of current pupil understanding</li>\n  <li>\n    How modelling provides more structure for learners early on in the domain\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>\nIn this example, I'm going to model how teacher exposition can support pupils to\nlearn.  I want you to imagine I'm teaching a year four geography lesson, and\nthis is part of a series on ordinance survey maps. In this lesson, pupils will\nlearn how to use four figure grid references to locate places on a map.\n\n<em>\n  “Okay, class, last lesson, we looked at ordinance survey maps, and how people\n  can use them. But this lesson, we're going to be looking at how we find\n  certain things on the map.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay, before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to three things\n  on the map.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The first is that the map is divided into squares [teacher points to squares\n  on map].\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The next thing is that we've got a horizontal line along the bottom. This is\n  called the eastings, and it's numbered, 74, 75, 76, et cetera [teacher points\n  to eastings line].\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  And the final thing is that we've got a vertical line up the side. This is\n  called the northings, and this is also numbered, one, two, three, and so on\n  [teacher points to northings line].{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So when we want to help somebody find something on a map, we give them a grid\n  reference.  This is a four digit number and it's made up of the eastings and\n  northings line numbers. So rather than somebody having to look on the map all\n  over to find the thing that you've told them to look for, instead, we give\n  them the four digit grid reference. And this is what I'm going to teach you\n  today, how to create that four digit number.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do is decide on a symbol that I'm going\n  to be looking for. I'm going to use the symbol P, what does the symbol P mean?\n  Aisha?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Parking, super. Okay, so the first thing I do is I highlight the square that\n  has my symbol in, and then I'm going put a cross in the bottom left hand\n  corner, you will see why in a moment.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So, remember those lines we were talking about, the eastings is the first one\n  we start with, along the bottom, the horizontal.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher drawing on map on board] So we go along the bottom until we come in\n  line with that x that we just drew. And now look at the number, 77. So this\n  forms the first part of my grid reference, and I put a comma after it. The\n  next thing I do is I then look at the northings. So I'm going to now go up\n  until I hit that cross again. And I look at the number here, 05. So this goes\n  here after the comma, one, two, three, four, that's my four digit grid\n  reference number.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So there's a couple of things I like to remember that helps me get these\n  numbers in the correct order. We have to put eastings first and northings\n  second, so I remember along the corridor and then up the stairs.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Let's do a couple more together, using that to help you remember the order\n  they go in.”\n</em>\n\nI want to draw your attention to a couple of things in that model. First, let's think about how I use pupils' current understanding as a starting point for the exposition. So, from the previous lesson, pupils know that a map is designed to help people navigate to somewhere. Knowing that maps are designed for navigation gives a meaningful and concrete purpose for the grid reference task. I also used the terms vertical and horizontal when introducing pupils to the new terms. I know that we'd learnt the terms vertical and horizontal in maths and art.\n\nSecondly, I explained and modelled the process of given a full figure grid reference to scaffold and support the learning. I used non-verbal gestures like tracing around the square with my finger to reinforce what I wanted the pupils to focus on, and I articulated my thought processes out loud, like always start from the bottom left hand corner. In doing this, I provided pupils with clear steps to follow, which is a really useful structure for their thinking. As I provide further examples that model and demonstrate this process, this is going to help pupils become familiar with identifying symbols and locating places of interest using the grid references. We'll work on these examples on the board, practising a range of examples together before moving on to the independent practice.\n\nBy modelling the process that we want pupils to engage in clearly, we can help to support and scaffold the new learning.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored how exposition can be used to support pupils to access\ncontent. Expositions are especially important for setting up new or complex material.\nBefore we finish, read through the key ideas of the module. Which of these have you\napplied in a recent lesson?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need\n    more structure early in a domain\n  </li>\n  <li>Starting expositions at the point of current pupil understanding</li>\n  <li>\n    Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation of\n    the same concept or process, where appropriate\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nTeachers are likely to use expositions in the majority of lessons they teach.\nThey might explain, model or demonstrate. It's a key instructional tool, which\nat its best can make content much more accessible and increase the chance of\nsuccess.\n\n&nbsp;\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I5.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Thomas is confident about what her pupils should learn. However, when she tries to convey new content to pupils, she struggles to keep their attention: if she gives a quick explanation, she gets lots of questions and confusion, but if she goes into a lot of detail, she fears pupils will stop listening. How can Ms Thomas most efficiently support her pupils’ thinking when conveying new ideas in her lessons, and get a sense of whether pupils have understood?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffective exposition uses models, concrete examples and is matched to pupils’ needs.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Effective exposition\n\nEffective teaching takes account of the limits of pupils’ working memories. Pupils may struggle if they experience cognitive overload: this is particularly likely if pupils are exposed to too much new material at once. Ms Thomas can manage pupil thinking effectively by introducing material in stages by:\n\n- Drawing on prior knowledge, explicitly linking to what pupils have already been taught.\n- Breaking material up into smaller chunks when introducing it to reduce overload.\n- Structuring her teaching around an ‘I-We-You' model. This should begin with what pupils already know; provide them with a clear explanation of the key ideas and demonstration of the task (I do); provide an opportunity to practise the task collectively and for the teacher to check pupil understanding (We do); and finally move to pupils working independently (You do) (Lemov, 2015).\n\nThe I-We-You structure provides multiple opportunities for teachers to convey new ideas by using concrete examples, modelling, and worked examples (Lemov, 2015). These place manageable demands on pupils’ working memory, supporting them to actively process and understand new material (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\n### Explanations\n\nWhen should Ms Thomas give explanations? Explanations are more effective when teachers want to convey concepts rather than processes (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). However, the examples teachers give are more important in pupils’ understanding than the explanations accompanying them (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). Ms Thomas wants her pupils to understand both concrete ideas (things they can visualise, like ‘numbers as counters’) and abstract ideas (things with fewer sensory properties such as ‘multiplication of numbers’).\n\nShe can best convey this to her pupils by using concrete examples in her exposition (ideally linked to current pupil understanding) and connecting them with more abstract ones, or by moving from concrete to abstract representations over time (Pashler et al., 2007). For example, she may introduce multiplication using counters and then remove these as pupils gain understanding of multiplication as an operation. Pupils find it easier to process an explanation where images are paired with spoken words, rather than where images are accompanied with extensive written text (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\n### Modelling\n\nConcrete examples can help Ms Thomas to introduce new concepts. What about new processes? When learning how to solve problems, pupils need support with their thinking through modelling. When teachers model and think aloud while demonstrating how to solve a problem, this provides cognitive support (Rosenshine, 2012). Modelling can be done in a variety of ways; the goal is to give pupils a scaffold while they are a novice before gradually removing it as their mental model develops.\n\nFor Ms Thomas, modelling might involve talking her pupils through each step of a new problem in maths. For writing an essay it might involve talking through the decisions she would make in writing. A particularly powerful form of modelling for new processes is providing a worked example that the teacher walks the class through. Novices who are provided with worked examples when learning a new problem outperform those without them (Sweller, 2016).\n\nWorked examples reduce cognitive load by providing scaffolding to help pupils break a problem into chunks, allowing teachers to introduce the problem step-by-step (Deans for Impact, 2015). Furthermore, providing worked examples can help pupils to focus on the relevant parts of the problem rather than wasting time looking at irrelevant solutions, or mismatching problems and solutions (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010). Worked examples provide scaffolding to help pupils master a particular part of the problem, both securing it within their mental model and making it available to draw on when required for the next part of the problem.\n\nIn sum, including concrete and abstract examples, and modelling by thinking aloud through worked examples, can effectively support pupils to understand new ideas without overloading their working memory.\n\n### Checking pupil understanding\n\nIn the opening problem, Ms Thomas also wanted to ensure that her pupils understood content. While examples and modelling can convey material, she will only know whether pupils have understood by checking their understanding. Pupils tend to believe that they understand something if it feels familiar, even if their understanding is superficial (Christodoulou, 2016). Formative assessments can help Ms Thomas gather information about what each of her pupils does and does not understand. After modelling how to complete a problem and before getting pupils to practise independently, Ms Thomas could ask questions to check pupil understanding.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhile guided instruction through modelling is more effective for novices than other forms of instruction, removing cognitive supports as pupils gain expertise is vital. Where pupils already have a strong understanding of how to solve a problem, worked examples may distract them from a process which they are capable of completing independently (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Thomas's expositions will better match pupil needs if she understands:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The importance of preventing pupil overload by first building on prior\n    knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The ‘I-We-You' approach helps her to ensure she manages pupil thinking and\n    working memory effectively.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using concrete and abstract examples, modelling, and worked examples in\n    expositions supports pupils when introducing new concepts and processes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Checking pupil understanding prior to letting them practise independently\n    can be a powerful approach.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nDeans for Impact (2015). _The Science of Learning._ [bit.ly/ecf-dea1](http://bit.ly/ecf-dea1)\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nDeans for Impact (2015). <em>The Science of Learning.</em> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ecf-dea1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bit.ly/ecf-dea1</a>\n\nLemov, D.

We can't simply\ntell our pupil something and assume that they'll learn it. Instead teachers need\nto regularly say to themselves: I've taught them something, but have they understood\nit? If pupils haven't understood something, how can I fix it? They need to ask lots\nof questions to explore what their pupils know and adapt their teaching based on\nwhat they find out.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nAdaptive teaching is where teachers identify what pupils know and can do and adapt\ntheir teaching in response. Adapting teaching helps to ensure that instruction and\nsupport are tailored to the particular needs of pupils. Pupils are likely to learn\nat different rates and require different levels of support.\n\nSome pupils will have special educational needs and disabilities which may require additional support, although having SEND is neither fixed nor permanent in all instances and can vary from subject to subject. We need to think carefully about what our pupils' differences are before we can adapt and tailor our teaching to meet their different needs. By giving the right level of stretch and support, teachers can help all pupils to meet challenging learning goals.\n\nIn order to adapt teaching effectively, teachers need to take steps both before and during a lesson. Before a lesson teachers can ask themselves three key questions:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What do I know about my pupils?</li>\n  <li>What do I know about the content I am teaching?</li>\n  <li>How might I adapt my teaching?</li>\n</ul>\nWhen answering the question, “what do I know about my pupils?” teachers should consider\nwhether they have any pupils with special educational needs or disabilities in their\nclass. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require\nadditional supports. Teachers should work with colleagues, families and pupils to\nidentify potential barriers to learning in advance. Another way of responding to\nthe question, “what do I know about my pupils?” is to look at reliable assessment\ndata. A task carried out at the end of the previous lesson might give teachers a\nuseful indication of what relevant prior knowledge their pupils have. Teachers shouldn't\nanswer this question through guesswork or assumptions. Adaptive teaching shouldn't\nlead to teachers setting lower expectations for some pupils.\n\nTo answer the question, “what do I know about the content I am teaching?” teachers can identify the key knowledge and skills that they want their pupils to get right, where their pupils might go wrong and how they will check pupil understanding during the lesson. It's a good idea to ask a colleague who's taught the content before about common misconceptions. As teachers get to know their subject and pupils, they will be able to make better predictions about specific content that some pupils may need support with.\n\nFinally, teachers need to spend some time in advance thinking about how they might respond. This could involve thinking of additional examples to give to pupils if they struggle to grasp a particular idea or providing them with another practice task. It might mean planning what questions you will ask to stretch or support pupil thinking. In some instances, teachers may need to provide additional or adapted support for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. It's important to work with specialist colleagues in school such as the SENDCo when doing this.\n\nAnother response might be to flexibly group pupils within a class to provide more tailored support. In the early stages of learning phonics, for example, some pupils may be able to start learning more complex sounds whereas other pupils may still be learning the sounds of individual letters. When delivering phonics instruction to the class, it may be useful to split the class into groups and tailor support to where each group is in their learning, recognizing that pupils develop fluency in phonics at very different rates and that pupils should not feel that they are either good or bad readers as a result of this grouping. Flexibly grouping pupils needs to be done very carefully and teachers need to consider the impact that it has on motivation and engagement.\n\nSo far, we have thought about what teachers can do before a lesson to adapt their teaching. We also need to consider what they can do during a lesson. During the lesson adaptive teaching involves teaching, checking and responding. Adaptive teaching should occur after some teacher input. Typically this happens during the exposition. This is sometimes referred to as the \"I do\" part of the lesson. The teacher can then check for understanding and respond based on what they find out. This part of the lesson is sometimes referred to as the \"we do\" part of the lesson. One way to check for understanding is through a series of questions. They could use a well-crafted multiple choice question that brings to light key misconceptions. Once teachers have this information, they can decide how to respond. You might need to re-explain something or correct a misconception. Pupils might need another example or you might want to provide a worked example where you go through a task or problem with pupils step-by-step. If teachers find that pupils are doing well in their learning, they might want to remove scaffolding in place, ask a question to stretch their thinking or set them off on some independent work.\n\nResponding to pupil needs shouldn't mean creating 30 different worksheets for 30 different pupils. Re-explaining something, providing another example or asking another question are quick and effective strategies that teachers shouldn't overlook. Working out the best way to respond on the spot isn't easy and it's something that teachers get better at over time as they get to know their pupils and their subject. But the more you've thought about how you will respond in advance, the better you'll be able to do so in the moment.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn this example you will see an Ambition coach model how to check that pupils understand\na key concept within a lesson before moving on. As you watch, pay particular attention\nto how they do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Structures tasks and instructions to enable the identification of knowledge\n    gaps and misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Adapts the lesson to address gaps in knowledge and misconception whilst\n    maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the\n    opportunity to meet expectations\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>I want you to imagine that I'm\nteaching a year seven maths lesson on fractions.  Pupils have been asked to add\nthe fractions from the board and to select the correct solution from the choices\navailable. So this is the problem.\n\nCalculate 3/8 plus 1/4 and select the correct answer from the options below.\n\nA: 3/32\n\nB: 5/8\n\nC: 4/12\n\nD: 5/16\n\nEach of the incorrect solutions has been generated to uncover some common misconceptions in knowledge that pupils have around adding fractions. I want to identify whether pupils hold these misconceptions and then respond by adapting the lesson if they exist. Pupils are using mini white boards to display their solutions so when I ask pupils to show me that answers, while some pupils have the correct answer, there are some who have made each of the errors. Therefore I'm going to go through the options pointing out where they might have gone wrong.\n\n<em>\n  “Okay, guys, we're going to do a show me in five, four, lids on pens, please.\n  Three, pens down, two, one. Show me [teacher scans the class].\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay, hold them up nice and high please. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, keep them up. Okay\n  super.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Alright, put those down. I can see a variety of responses around the room so\n  what I'd like to do is I'd like to go back through the process so we can\n  identify maybe where we went wrong and prevent you going wrong there in the\n  future.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay so let's have a look at the board. So this is our original problem. Now\n  those of you who've got C, just have a look at your board now, if you've\n  arrived at C, you've been thinking we're adding fractions. So what you've done\n  is you've added three plus one, you've added your numerators and you've also\n  then added your denominators so you've ended up at 4/12. But in actual fact\n  the first thing we need to think about is making the denominators the same. We\n  want equivalent fractions. So we need a number that both eight and four go\n  into, a multiple. Can you give me a multiple of eight and four? Lucy?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n   You got 32. Yeah. Okay so you got 32 so you've multiplied eight by four and\n  you've ended up with 32 and you've got eight there on your board, haven't you\n  and I can see a few more around the room. How'd you then think you got three\n  as your numerator if you've put A? What else do you think you did? Josh?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Yeah, you've multiplied three by one because you've multiplied the bottom as\n  well. So you've gone through the first process of wanting to get the same\n  denominator, but in actual fact we needed to find the lowest common multiple.\n  So what's the smallest number eight and four go into? Jessica?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n   Yep, eight, absolutely. So the first thing that we do is if we've multiplied\n  four by two to make it eight, we also do the same thing to the top so we're\n  going to multiply that by two. So we end up with 2/8. And what I'm going to do\n  is I'm going to write down the rest of the problem next to it because\n  obviously there's a bit of a jumble of information up here. So now our\n  question becomes 3/8 plus 2/8. At this point you might think all your work's\n  done. If you have ended up with your answer is D, Jamie, what do you think you\n  might have done there?\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n   So you're thinking you've got 5/16. You've added eight and eight. Yeah,\n  absolutely and you've added three and two, but in actual fact we want this to\n  be all part of the same whole. These are all part of the same whole. So we\n  never add the denominators. We add the numerators only. So three plus two is\n  five, denominator stays the same so our correct answer is B. So now you've got\n  that.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Wipe your boards clean and we're going try another one together to see if we\n  can overcome those mistakes next time around.”\n</em>\n\nI want to draw your attention to a couple of things in the model. First, I structured the problem so that I could identify misconceptions. I began by identifying the problems that I anticipated pupils would have. The incorrect responses illustrated typical mistakes pupils make. Multiplying values instead of adding, not finding a common denominator and then also adding the denominators together. I know from discussions with experienced colleagues that these are the errors that pupils commonly make so it's really important to check for them.\n\nSecondly, I checked for understanding across the whole class. By using multiple choice questions here, I was able to see all of my pupils answers really quickly and get a picture of what they did or didn't understand. If I'd have just asked one or two pupils to provide their answer, it probably wouldn't have told me enough about the whole class to adapt my teaching effectively.\n\nFinally, I asked individual pupils questions that would require them to think through how they got to the answer that they did, supporting them to realize their error. The key to this model is the fact that I had anticipated where the pupils may go wrong and I have planned what my response would be. If I know what I'm looking for, I can spot it more quickly and then I can focus my efforts on giving a really high-quality response instead of working one out on the spot.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video we have looked at some of the ways in which teachers can identify what\npupils know and how they might respond. Which of the following ideas do you think\nthat the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Structure tasks and instructions to enable the identification of knowledge\n    gaps and misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>Include a range of types of questions to extend and challenge pupils</li>\n  <li>\n    Adapt the lesson to address gaps in knowledge and misconception whilst\n    maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the\n    opportunity to meet expectations\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nLearning something new isn't a linear process. It won't look the same for all\npupils. Learning requires a regular back and forth between the teacher and the\npupil to check how it's going. Teachers need to identify what pupils are\nthinking and adapt their teaching in response. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I6.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Garcia feels increasingly confident at identifying key content and presenting it effectively, building on pupil prior knowledge. However, she notices that sometimes pupils grasp key ideas quickly, while at other times pupils struggle to do so at all. Sometimes it is individuals or groups of pupils that struggle, at other times the whole class. How can she adapt her teaching to better meet the needs of all pupils?\n\n## Key idea\n\nAdapting teaching requires assessment of pupil needs and appropriate teacher responses, before the lesson and within it, to enable a high pupil success rate.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Adapting teaching aims to support all pupils to be successful\n\nEffective teachers adapt their teaching to respond to the needs of the class and individual pupils (OECD, 2015). This doesn’t mean adapting lessons to different ‘learning styles’ such as ‘visual’ or ‘kinaesthetic’ as the evidence is unambiguous: while pupils have different learning preferences, they do not have distinct learning styles (Coe, 2013).\n\nWhen pupils are introduced to new ideas, explicit guided teaching is more effective than pupils discovering new ideas without teacher support (Coe et al., 2014). However, pupils learn at different rates and have different levels of prior knowledge. Effective approaches to establishing pupils needs and adapting teaching are available. Teachers can check pupils’ needs through gathering information on what pupils do and don’t understand yet. Once they have, adaptations they could make include:\n\n- New information broken down into smaller steps.\n- Additional explanations and examples.\n- Additional forms of teacher support (Gathercole et al., 2006)\n- Additional stretch, for example through questions which extend pupil thinking, or removal of unnecessary support.\n\nThis is responsive teaching: using evidence of what pupils have understood to allow us to adapt our teaching to better meet pupils’ needs (Wiliam, in Christodoulou, 2017).\n\nResponsive teaching does not mean creating distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or setting lower expectations for some (Pashler et al. 2007). Instead it entails identifying key content pupils might struggle with and options to support or stretch them, to make sure all pupils are successful. To make the workload of adapting teaching manageable, teachers should focus on a few key barriers and key adaptations.\n\n### Find out what pupils know, and teach them accordingly\n\nResponsive teaching requires effective ways to monitor pupils’ learning (Deunk et al., 2018). If what pupils learnt was the same as what they were taught, there would be no need for assessment at all; however, we know that what pupils remember from a lesson can vary enormously (Wiliam, 2010).\n\nMs Garcia needs to collect and use assessment information to inform her key instructional decisions (Wiliam & Leahy, 2015). She can either use information to decide whether to adapt teaching between lessons, or within a lesson. To adapt effectively, she needs to prepare assessments based on key information she needs pupils to understand, to show her which pupils lack key knowledge or hold misconceptions and which pupils have a firm grasp of key material (Christodoulou, 2017). For example, teachers can use a sequence of carefully crafted questions and collect whole class responses to detect misconceptions and so more precisely target their teaching (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\n### Adapting teaching before the lesson\n\nSome adaptations can be planned before the lesson or unit begins. It is good practice for teachers to seek support and information in advance about specific barriers to learning and specific solutions to these for individual pupils, particularly for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. A conversation with the SENCo or parents or referring to the SEND code of practice may help. For example, a teacher may find out that a pupil’s ability to write is impaired and print resources for them. Teachers can also draw on formative assessment data collected in a previous lesson to adapt teaching to either stretch or support pupils.\n\n### Adapting teaching within the lesson: worked examples and groups\n\nPre-lesson preparation can also support responsive teaching within the lesson, guided by the I-We-You instructional approach to get the right balance of stretch and support (Lemov, 2015). Teachers can prepare adaptations in advance and deploy them responsively if assessment reveals pupils need them.\n\nIf in-lesson assessment reveals the majority of pupils have struggled with a specific idea or question, teachers can use worked examples to illustrate correct solutions. Worked examples reduce the cognitive burden that pupils feel when learning a new skill by breaking it down into smaller sections, allowing pupils to master the foundations before moving onto more complex parts (Deans for Impact, 2015). Ms Garcia may choose to use an additional worked example with pupils who have not yet grasped a particular skill; or break down a worked example even further for certain pupils while ensuring all work towards the same endpoint. Pupils benefit from explicit teaching and hearing many examples and questions (Rosenshine, 2012) so, if in doubt, giving a further example will often be helpful, even if assessment suggests some pupils have understood the idea.\n\nMs Garcia may also want to consider how to adapt groupings within her classroom to ensure that she can best tailor support to individuals’ needs. Grouping pupils within a class based on their current level of understanding could help Ms Garcia more precisely target support. Doing so relies on assessing pupils’ needs accurately, providing all groups with sufficient support and maintaining high expectations for everyone (Coe et al., 2014). For example, assessment may reveal most pupils are ready for independent practice, but a few still need teacher support, in which case Ms Garcia may create a small focus group to support once the class is practising independently – though she must be careful to make clear that this group is based on attainment and change it regularly. However, this may be tricky to achieve without embedded routines and behaviour expectations (IES, 2008).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nGrouping pupils by ability has a limited impact on pupil outcomes (Coe et al., 2014) so care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.\n\nThe aim of responsive teaching is to support pupil success. If pupils are practising independently and struggling, Ms Garcia should still stop the class (or intervene with particular pupils) to provide further support. Similarly, if Ms Garcia’s assessment suggests pupils need stretching, she can let pupils move on to more challenging work, while monitoring carefully to ensure they are successful, in case support is needed.\n\nTeaching assistants can adapt teaching for assigned pupils, for example pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. However, they need to be prepared for the lesson by the teacher, and supplement not replace teacher support (EEF, 2018). For example, providing they can further break down tasks during guided practice.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Garcia can effectively adapt her teaching if she understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Adapting teaching means identifying key adaptations and deploying them\n    responsively to ensure pupils experience a high success rate.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Whole class questioning can expose what pupils understand to inform\n    responsive teaching.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers need to understand key pupil differences and potential barriers to\n    learning, especially for pupils with special educational needs or\n    disabilities, and prepare solutions <em>before</em> the lesson.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Worked examples and careful grouping can support pupils to fill knowledge\n    gaps or correct misconceptions.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nDeunk, M.

They\nneed time to think carefully about the content, to commit it to their long-term memory.\nPupils need lots of time practising with a teacher and lots of time practising on\ntheir own. They also need the chance to retrieve what they know, which is called\nretrieval practice. Practice is an important part of learning and teachers need to\nknow how to get the best out of it.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWhen we discuss practice, we're talking about the opportunities for people to think\nhard about content or retrieve previously learned content. Think of it as the \"you\ndo\" phase of the I-We-You model, where pupils are primarily working without teacher\ninput. Providing our pupils with opportunities to think about challenging content\nincreasingly on their own will help them secure what they learn and use it later\non.\n\nIn order to remember something in the long term, pupils need to think about it and connect it to existing knowledge. Because we have a tendency to forget over time, pupils also need repeated opportunities to draw up information from their long-term memory. This is called retrieval practice. Effective practice gets pupils to think hard about what it is you want them to remember.\n\nWhen designing practice, teachers need to check that the tasks get pupils to think about what they want them to learn and that the thinking required is pitched at the right level. Firstly, we need to ensure that practice tasks get pupils to think about the concepts, knowledge, and skills that we want pupils to remember. For example, when teaching photosynthesis, you might create a practice task that involves drawing a picture of a plant. Whilst this is clearly linked to the learning, there is a risk that pupils will spend lots of time thinking about colouring in the plant. We want them to think hard about the process, so it might be better to present them with an image of a plant and ask them to annotate it. Pupils will remember what they think about during a task. On the other hand, if a pupil doesn't think about the learning, they won't remember it.\n\nSecondly, we need to pitch practice carefully. We want our pupils to think hard when facing challenging work but also to put their best effort in and experience a high success rate. If practice is too hard, then it's likely to be off-putting. So teachers need to check that pupils have acquired enough knowledge during previous stages of learning to be able to work more independently. Equally, teachers need to ensure that the task will stretch pupils. If practice is too easy, it won't require much cognitive effort. Pupil thinking needs to be effortful if it is to be retained. Getting the pitch of practice right gets easier as teachers get to know their pupils and develop their subject knowledge over time. Teachers should also ensure that they provide pupils with enough support in the previous phases of instruction before asking pupils to work independently. This can help them to achieve that high rate of success.\n\nAs well as making sure that pupils have acquired enough knowledge to access the activity, it can also help to use the same material in guided practice and independent practice. For example, if teachers have guided pupils through the process of accurately using commas to punctuate a subordinate clause, it makes sense to ask them to practice this same task on their own, rather than practicing adding commas to separate items in a list. Or if a history teacher has modelled the analytical process of identifying the nature, origin, and purpose of a picture source, it would be helpful for pupils to have a go at following this analytical process on their own, perhaps on a different picture source, assuming that pupils have the necessary knowledge to access both.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that there is no set formula for how much practice pupils will need. The amount, frequency, and emphasis of practice varies depending on the content and on the pupil. For example, a teacher might choose to come back to the difference between a fact and opinion a number of times across the year. This is a core concept that pupils need to remember. However, once a pupil has grasped the term onomatopoeia quickly, a teacher might not dedicate precious practice time to it.\n\nTeachers also need to expect the unexpected when pupils are practicing on their own. Even when a teacher has checked that pupils understand something before they practice, they still might make mistakes. Teachers need to check pupil work during practice and may need to correct errors or pause and reteach. Pupils may well make mistakes during practice, but they shouldn't continue to practise these same mistakes over time. Otherwise, there is a risk that mistakes will stick.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see an Ambition coach model how they might set up an\nindependent practice task. As you watch, pay particular attention to how the coach\ndoes the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Plans activities around what pupils should think hard about</li>\n  <li>\n    Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough\n    support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting\n    challenging work\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, I'm going to model how the teacher sets up independent\npractice, which links to the learning in class and the pupils' previous\nlearning. I want you to imagine that this is a year eight French lesson. I'm\nabout to introduce the independent practice task, which is to write a postcard\nin French which includes the near future tense. I'm confident that pupils have\nthe knowledge and skills required to access the task. We've been learning about\nhow to use the near future tense in this lesson. Pupils have written postcards\nin French as part of previous lessons, so they're familiar with the key features\nof this type of writing. And in a previous lesson, pupils learned vocabulary and\nphrases including hobbies and holiday activities.\n\n<em>\n  “Today, we've been learning about how to use the near future tense to talk\n  about our future plans. We have practised adapting sentences from the present\n  tense into the near future, and you've also practised writing your own\n  sentences using the near future tense. So I think you're ready for something a\n  little bit more challenging, and we're going to write a postcard using that\n  near future tense.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Imagine that you're on holiday and you're writing a postcard home to your best\n  friend. So all of that vocabulary that we learned about what you do in your\n  free time and what you do on holidays, you can use it here.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I've also given you a list of infinitives that you can use too. I want you to\n  write four sentences in total in your postcard.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Use the present tense to talk about what you're doing now. Use the perfect\n  tense to talk about what you did yesterday. And use the near future tense to\n  talk about what you will do tomorrow. And I want you to do two sentences using\n  the near future tense. So that's four sentences in total.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So how many sentences do I want you to write in the present tense? Ben?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Exactly. How many sentences do we need to write in the perfect tense? Sarah?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>Spot on. And how many sentences in the near future tense? Princess? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer]</em>\n\n<em>Perfect. And what vocabulary can you use to help you? Iris? </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct answer] </em>\n\n<em>Great. So 10 minutes working in silence, off we go.\" </em>\n\nI want to draw your attention to a couple of things in that model.\n\nFirst, the task clearly gets pupils to think about what I need them to learn. For this lesson, pupils are learning how to use the near future tense. In this task, pupils are required to write two sentences in the near future tense. I drew attention to this by explicitly naming the tenses that they should use. In this part of my instruction, notice how I began each sentence by telling pupils what tense to use. Use the present tense. Use the perfect tense. Use the near future tense. We tend to notice things that repeat. In this case, that means noticing the focus on which tense they should write in. Even in the task instructions, I'm encouraging them to think about the learning goal.\n\nSecondly, I designed this practice task to provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting this work. They were using vocabulary that they know they're secure in, and they had a list of infinitives to use. By providing this scaffolding, we help to manage the cognitive load of the lesson content so pupils can focus on the key learning, in this case, accurate use of the near future tense. This is a challenging task because pupils are having to apply previously learned content and new content. But the supports that I've provided should prevent it from being overwhelming.\n\nFinally, before setting pupils off on the task, I asked a couple of questions to check that they had understood. Again, my questions focused on the content that I wanted them to think particularly hard about. Pupils were clear about what they needed to do and were supported to do it well.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've explored why practice is so important for learning and some\nexamples of what good practice looks like.

But while his checks for understanding reveal pupils have understood what he has taught, he notices that pupils are not yet able to securely grasp and apply key ideas independently. How can his instruction support pupils to consolidate their learning?\n\n## Key idea\n\nProviding opportunities for purposeful practice supports pupils to consolidate and secure what they have learned.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Learning is about remembering and connecting information\n\nMr Andrews now understands that ‘learning is the residue of thought’ (Willingham, 2009). In particular, what people have thought hard about (Coe, 2013). Thinking takes place in working memory where people combine knowledge from their long-term memory with new information (Willingham, 2009). To commit new information to long-term memory, pupils must have a strong foundation of prior knowledge.\n\nPupils consolidate their existing knowledge by retrieving it from long-term memory and using it to answer questions or solve problems (Roediger & Butler, 2011). This allows them to process new information faster and more accurately (Sweller, 2016). For example, they can comprehend new information by linking it with familiar words or ideas. What can Mr Andrews do to support pupils to successfully consolidate material?\n\n### Practice supports successful remembering and connecting\n\nRegular purposeful practice consolidates pupils’ understanding and helps them remember key ideas. Practice can happen in the ‘We do’ as well as the ‘You do’ parts of instruction. Initially, teachers should scaffold practice as part of ‘We do’ (Lemov, 2015), for example by solving problems with pupils, to show them how to complete problems. Over time, teachers can decrease the support they offer to help pupils practise independently (IES, 2008).\n\nIndependent practice tasks (‘You do’) (Lemov, 2015) should relate closely to those covered in guided practice. Otherwise pupils may struggle and waste time identifying what to do (Kirschner et al., in Christodoulou, 2017). This also allows pupils to focus on becoming more fluent at solving a problem or recalling information (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, if the guided practice has been about adding fractions, this should also be the focus of independent practice, rather than adding _and_ subtracting fractions.\n\nOver time, practice should support the development of expertise by consolidating mental models, as thinking hard secures memories and makes new connections. This helps pupils to free up their working memory to tackle more complicated problems (Sweller, 2016). For example, practising times tables allows pupils to tackle more advanced maths problems more easily.\n\nFor practice to be effective, teachers need to ensure pupils achieve a high success rate, ideally of around 80% (Rosenshine, 2012). Mr Andrews needs to ensure that where pupils are not regularly successful in their practice, he intervenes with feedback which pupils can act on. He can also acknowledge and praise pupil effort and emphasise progress made toward eventual success. High levels of success also improve pupils’ motivation (Coe et al., 2014).\n\n### Effective approaches to independent practice\n\nAfter introducing content in small steps, supported through models and guided instruction, Mr Andrews now needs to get his pupils to practise independently. How should he organise and ‘space’ this practice over time?\n\n- Spacing practice over time (or ‘distributing’ it) makes learning feel harder but improves pupils’ retention because they have to think harder about it (Dunlosky et al., 2013).\n- Assuming pupils are getting questions right, teachers can increase the intervals between practice (Dunlosky et al., 2013).\n\nMr Andrews should be intentional in not just how he spaces practice but what he includes in practice. He should consider not just what he has recently taught but also supporting pupils to master challenging content which builds towards long-term goals. Therefore, pupils should practise skills and knowledge from previous weeks and months. He can increase the challenge by removing scaffolding, lengthening spaces or introducing interacting elements, for example a more complicated problem where one step relies on a previous step.\n\nWhile practice matters, “not all practice is equivalent” (Deans for Impact, 2015). Setting up pupils for independent practice might involve Mr Andrews giving his pupils a set of problems to solve but it could also involve teaching them to self-quiz. Testing is among the most effective techniques for supporting pupils to remember what they have learned (Pan et al., 2018). Retrieval is also more effective than other independent study activities such as re-reading and highlighting (Dunlosky et al., 2013) because it requires pupils to think hard.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhile increasing time gaps between practice is beneficial for learning, this is not always practical. It depends how long pupils need to recall this information for. For example, to remember something for one week, practice should be spaced 12 to 24 hours apart. Whereas, to remember something for five years, practice should be spaced 6 to 12 months apart (Dunlosky et al., 2013).\n\nLots of practice at once (cramming) can be effective if pupils know very little and want to pass an exam – however, this is not an appropriate strategy if we want them to remember these ideas the following year or beyond.\n\nHomework might be a good opportunity for further practice of what has been learnt in class. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of the homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set (EEF, 2018).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Summary of key takeaways</h3>\nMr Andrews can support successful practice if he understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Learning is about remembering and connecting information through thinking\n    hard.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Purposeful practice which causes pupils to think hard improves their\n    retention.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instruction includes purposeful practice and regular retrieval.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nDeans for Impact (2015). _The Science of Learning_.

We want them to be able to work independently.\nIn order to get there, pupils need to acquire a body of knowledge and skills, which\nthey can use to solve a range of problems. Explicitly teaching knowledge and skills\ncan be beneficial. This doesn't mean that pupils are passive in the process. Instead\nit recognizes that pupils need support in order to move from dependence to independence.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nExplicit teaching describes a particular approach to instruction and it's underpinned\nby what we know about how pupils learn. Explicit teaching means introducing new material\nin steps, working through that material with pupils to check they understand it,\nand gradually withdrawing support so that they can work through it on their own.\nThe I, We, You model is one way of thinking about this. I teach you something, we\ngo through it together, and you have a go on your own.\n\nThere may be some overlap between stages but the ‘I phase’ broadly matches with teacher exposition. The ‘We phase’ is assessing and responding. And the ‘You phase’ is independent practice. Explicit teaching matches instruction to pupils starting points and gives them the support needed to learn the important knowledge and skills of the subject over time. The academic Barak Rosenshine has written extensively about explicit teaching. He argues that most effective teachers ensure that <em>\"pupils acquire, rehearse and connect background knowledge through a great deal of instructional support\"</em>.\n\nTeachers can carry out explicit teaching by following the I, We, You model. This involves applying many of the principles of how pupils learn. For example, it's important during the 'I' part to start instruction at the point of current pupil understanding. Teachers also need to consider how to break new material into small manageable steps; concrete examples, partially complete examples (often called worked examples), guides, and scaffolds can be powerful methods of showing pupils new material.\n\nThen there is the 'We' phase of the model. At the heart of explicit teaching is questioning, lots and lots of questioning. Teachers can use questions to encourage pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion.  Once material has been taught, teachers need to ask themselves, what have pupils understood? Are there any gaps in their understanding? Do I need to explain this bit again? Do they have any misconceptions? They can then use what they find out to adapt their teaching in response. They might need to reteach something provide another example or correct a misconception. The 'We' part is a good time for this. Although teachers can of course ask questions and respond during other phases too.\n\nOnce pupils have acquired some new knowledge or skills and teachers have checked that it's secure, pupils need to have lots of opportunities to practise it. The 'You' part of the model, where pupils practise on their own, is just as important as the 'I' or the 'We' phase. Put another way: independent practice is just as important as teacher expositions and assessing and responding.\n\nTeachers need to get the balance right between exposition repetition, practice, and retrieval of critical skills. They also need to accept that this instructional model may extend over more than one lesson. Lessons or periods are arbitrary ways of breaking up learning. It might be completely appropriate to only get through the 'I' and 'We' phases and get pupils to practise independently at another time.\n\nExplicit teaching is a really effective way of guiding pupil learning. This doesn't mean pupils should be passive recipients of knowledge. In a subject like English for example, getting pupils to share their personal response to a text is a key skill that we want them to develop. It's part of the joy of reading, but if the pupil can't understand the words in the text or is confused by some of the references the text makes, it may be difficult for them to come up with a response.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see an Ambition Institute coach model a short I, We,\nYou sequence, to take you through the key stages of explicit teaching. As you watch\npay particular attention to how the coach does the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Links what pupils already know to what is being taught</li>\n  <li>\n    Makes the steps in a process memorable and ensures pupils can recall them\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Encourages pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so\n    that misconceptions can be addressed\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nI'm about to take you through a short sequence of learning using the I, We, You\nmodel, so that you can see what explicit teaching looks like in practice.\nImagine that I'm teaching a year three French lesson. We've been studying the\nFrench version of \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\". This is lesson six of eight and\npupils are writing sentences about foods that they like.\n\n<em>“So today we're going to write sentences about the foods that we like. </em>\n\n<em>Yesterday we learned loads of new words for different types of food. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Today, we're going to practise those new words by using them in sentences.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I model mine. Then we'll do one together. And then you'll write your sentences\n  in your exercise books.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So first, I'm going to choose a food that I like. I'm going to choose apples\n  because I like apples.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>Second, I'm going to say my sentence in English. I like apples. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Third, I'm going to choose the word for I like, which is j'aime and practise\n  saying my sentence: j'aime les pommes. I like apples. Now I write my sentence\n  in French [teacher writes on white board]: j'aime les pommes. I like apples.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Finally, I need to check that I've included the word for the. I need to write\n  les pommes as in French you would say, I like the apples. Pommes would be\n  incorrect.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now, let's try one together. Mackenzie, first of all, can you tell me a food\n  that you like from the foods that we identified in the book.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Sweets, let's say that sentence in English Mackenzie. I like sweets. What's\n  the word for I like in French? Hannah.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Yes, well done. J'aime means I like. Let's say that sentence out loud, Adam.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers]</em>\n\n<em>\n  J'aime bonbon. Let's check. Have we included the word for the? So let's\n  correct that Adam. J'aime les bonon. Great. Now let's say that together.\n  \"J'aime les bonbon\"{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Brilliant, now I'll write it on the board [teacher writes on white board]:\n  J'aime les bonbon.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Let's do one more check. Which sentence is correct? Is it one: j'aime les\n  bonbon, or is it two: j'aime bonon? Show me with your fingers in three, two,\n  one.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Pupils hold up fingers to show their answer. Teacher scans whole class]\n</em>\n\n<em>You've all said one, which is correct. It includes the word les. </em>\n\n<em>\n  I want you to write your own sentences in your exercise books. Included the\n  word bank on the board with some of the words in English and the words in\n  French. And you also have a sentence starter in your exercise books from\n  earlier. If you need it.”\n</em>\n\nThis is a short sequence that demonstrates how you can guide pupil learning. To begin with I made sure that I connected what pupils already knew to what was being taught. Pupils were using vocabulary that they had learned in a previous lesson to write sentences.\n\nDuring the 'I' phase, I modelled a good answer to pupils on the board. And made the steps in the process memorable by numbering them and using the same steps in the 'I' phase as the 'We' phase.\n\nAsking specific pupils to contribute a response to each step in the task helped them to recall them. It also enables me to check that pupils understood the task. I knew what knowledge and skills to draw on.\n\nFinally, I encouraged pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion, so that I could check for misconceptions. I asked the whole class the question to see if they had remembered that they need to add the word for the: les. Pupils often forget to add the definite article. By checking what pupils understand I can correct mistakes before they practise on their own.\n\nIn this example, the 'I' and 'We' phases of the sequence helped me to feel confidence that pupils were ready to work independently. They will still have to think hard during independent practice but guiding and checking their thinking beforehand will increase the likelihood of success.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video we have explored what the term explicit teaching means and provided\na model to help you think about it: I, We, You.

But sometimes, when considering how to use these strategies in combination, she notices that she is unsure how they fit together. When does pupil misunderstanding mean she should use more teacher talk? When do pupils need more practice? Is there an overall model of instruction which can help her review her lessons to decide if her instruction is supporting pupils to learn as effectively as they can?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers should deploy instructional strategies that provide most teacher support early in the instructional sequence and gradually withdraw this support to ensure pupils successfully gain knowledge and skills.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Explicit teaching of knowledge and skills is teacher-led\n\nExplicit teaching means teachers provide fully guided instruction to pupils when introducing new knowledge and skills (Sweller, 2016). Ms Sims chooses to pursue explicit teaching because it is the most efficient way to develop her pupils’ mental models – the collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which comprise their understanding of a topic or a subject. To build these mental models, Ms Sims can combine a variety of techniques.\n\nOne model which can be helpful when thinking about how to sequence these techniques is the ‘I-We-You' approach (Lemov, 2015). When pupils begin learning a topic or skill, they benefit from first receiving guided instruction from the teacher, as opposed to discovering key ideas for themselves (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nOne reason this approach is effective is because working memory is limited. If pupils have to discover the key ideas themselves, or complete a complicated process with limited guidance, they will find it difficult to do and to remember. However, teachers can make this process easier through an effective ‘I do’, for example linking to pupil prior knowledge, addressing common misconceptions and introducing material in steps through explanations and models. As pupils acquire knowledge and skills, their expertise increases, and Ms Sims can encourage them to work increasingly independently, first with teacher support (‘We do’) and then practising alone (‘You do’) to gain mastery. Such a sequence makes it more likely pupils will be successful (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n### 'I do’ - effective teacher exposition\n\nSo how can Ms Sims provide adequate guidance to pupils when introducing new material? During the ‘I do’ section of the lesson, Ms Sims can help her pupils grasp new ideas by introducing new material in steps and crafting careful explanations (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010) using worked and partially worked examples or models (Pashler et al., 2007; Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake for Ms Sims to believe teacher guided instruction means no thinking or input from pupils. During the ‘I do’, reviewing previous learning both helps pupils recall useful prior knowledge and helps her to decide how much guidance pupils need and in which areas (Rosenshine, 2012). She should allow pupils to practise after each new step has been introduced and ask questions to help students process new material from her exposition. This will ensure pupils are thinking hard about new knowledge and skills and connecting them to previous learning (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n### Assessing before moving on\n\nExplaining, modelling and questioning pupils – developing their mental models – before individual practice tends to be most effective (Rosenshine, 2012). However, if Ms Sims wants her pupils to learn efficiently, she must balance the risks of falling into two opposite traps: spending too long explaining ideas to pupils (‘I do’) or moving too quickly to practice (‘We do’ or ‘You do’) without first assessing whether pupils need further guidance.\n\nThis can be tricky because we cannot see mental models developing. Just because a pupil looks busy or writes lots, it does not necessarily mean that they have learnt something (Coe, 2013). Learning something can also take time, with pupils typically benefiting more from experiencing multiple exposures to information, ideally spaced out over time (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\nMs Sims can use diagnostic assessments to inform her decisions about teaching. She can do this by thinking carefully about the specific knowledge and skills she wants her pupils to acquire and using questions to which all or most pupils have to respond. This will enable her to get an impression of whether pupils have acquired the intended knowledge and skills (Christodoulou, 2017), and what to do next with them.\n\n### ‘We do, You do’ - guided practice, independent practice\n\nWhen Ms Sims transitions to the ‘We do’ section, she should avoid removing all support immediately. Her key consideration should be that pupils obtain a high success rate, ideally of around 80%: initially, she can provide scaffolds to achieve this and check for understanding (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, Ms Sims could invite students to rehearse new material by rephrasing, elaborating or summarising (Rosenshine, 2012). She can also provide guides and scaffolds for trickier tasks to ensure pupils do not become overwhelmed by trying to practise too much complex material too soon (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nBut the ‘You do’ stage of independent practice is also important for pupil learning. Ms Sims should continue to check for understanding and, when appropriate, remove scaffolds and guidance so that pupils can practise independently (Pashler et al., 2007). A key goal of independent practice is for pupils to gain automaticity so they can effortlessly use their knowledge and skills (Rosenshine, 2012). Ms Sims may tell pupils that they need to ‘practise beyond the point when they get it right, to the point where they can’t get it wrong’.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nI-We-You offers valuable guidance for sequencing learning, but it is not a rule: it is not equally appropriate across all subjects and phases. An I-We-You structure supports learning across individual lessons but can also be used in shorter cycles within a lesson, or over several lessons.\n\nThe expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, 2007) means that as pupils gain knowledge and skills, too much support can stop them using what they already know. As a result, it is important that teachers check for understanding to ensure they are not ‘over-scaffolding' learning, withdrawing support as appropriate.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Sims can be more confident her instruction is effective if she understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Explicit teaching of knowledge and skills can help form effective mental\n    models.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instruction is underpinned by what we know about how pupils learn\n    and checking this through effective assessment.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective instruction often uses the I-We-You model to introduce new\n    material in steps, using concrete examples and worked examples, gradually\n    withdrawing support and promoting independent practice with a high success\n    rate, both within lessons and over time.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nRosenshine, B.

This is called scaffolding. Much like scaffolding\non a building, it helps pupils to access parts of learning that they might struggle\nto get to on their own. It also needs to be removed once it has done its job. Scaffolding\nis a necessary but temporary support.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWe define scaffolding as a temporary aid used to support pupils with their learning.\nScaffolds, like those used on buildings, allow pupils to reach areas that they would\nstruggle to get to without help. Once they've served their purpose, they're removed.\nThe aim of scaffolding is to gradually transfer responsibility of a task or learning\nfrom the teacher to the pupils.\n\nWhen scaffolding is in place, teachers can establish high expectations and set challenging work knowing that the scaffold will make it more manageable. When content might be complex or abstract, scaffolds help pupils to experience success and allow them to access ambitious end goals. It is important that scaffolds support the right things and that they are gradually withdrawn.\n\nA useful way of thinking about this is to compare how a balance bike for children works as compared to stabilizers. When children learn how to ride a bike, they need to learn how to balance on two wheels first. Stabilizers do the work of balancing, meaning that children focus first on learning how to pedal, but that isn't what they need to master first. On the other hand, a balance bike simply removes the pedals. It allows children to practice balancing before working out how to pedal. In this case, the absence of pedals acts as a scaffold. Children can concentrate on what they need to learn, the balancing, without the added complexity of pedalling. A balance bike scaffolds the right thing. Teachers need to check what job their scaffold is doing.\n\nWhen planning to introduce a scaffold, teachers can ask themselves a series of questions, such as the following: what do I want my pupils to think about? What will they be able to do on their own and what will they need help with? What might get in the way? Does the scaffold remove the obstacle, or does it replace the thinking?\n\nRemember, scaffolds shouldn't replace the thinking that you want pupils to do, and they need to be withdrawn gradually. Teachers can carry out scaffolds in a variety of ways.\n\nModelling is one form of scaffolding. Modelling helps to show pupils the most effective way to answer a problem or to carry out a task. Another scaffold that might be used are checklists. Checklists support pupils to attend to numerous aspects of their work. A teacher might also provide a list of key vocabulary on the boards. When a pupil gives an answer in their own non-specialist's words, the teacher can ask them to rephrase their response using the disciplinary language on the boards. Here, pupils are doing the hard work of thinking about a response, and the list of words forms a scaffold that allows them to articulate their ideas more precisely. Worked examples are another scaffold that might be useful. Worked examples, where pupils go through a partially complete example with their teacher, help pupils to see the steps taken in solving a problem.\n\nRegardless of the technique used as a scaffold, they should be temporary in nature. As pupils begin to achieve a high success rate, scaffolding should be removed. Otherwise, pupils might become reliant on the support and not be able to access the content independently. In some instances, scaffolds may actually inhibit learning. Where pupils have gained expertise, practice and independent activities without scaffolds might be more effective for pupil learning.\n\nWhen we get scaffolds right and fade them out over time, our pupils feel supported, achieve success, and are set up to have a go on their own.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model a specific scaffolding\nstrategy. As you watch, look out for how they do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough\n    support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting\n    challenging work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Removes scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success\n    in applying previously taught material\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nFor the purposes of this model, imagine I'm teaching a year nine Biology class\nabout osmosis. I've taught the topic, and I want to give them another\nopportunity to practice what they've learned. From previous assessments, the\ngroup's understanding of the science is good, but they are struggling to use the\nkey scientific terminology. I've therefore provided a scaffold of key words on\nthe board. Firstly, to help improve the accuracy of their verbal answers and\nthen written answers in their workbook. After this lesson, having read their\ndefinitions, I'll decide if I can remove the scaffold partially or completely\ndepending on their use of this vocabulary in their written work. Pupils have\ncompleted a starter activity recapping what we learned last lesson, and I'm now\nasking them, using cold call, to describe what happens to a red blood cell\nthat's placed in pure water.\n\n<em>\n  “So what happens to a red blood cell in pure water? In your answer, I'd like\n  you to make use of the key scientific terminology on the board, and I'm now\n  going to give you 30 seconds to think about your answer. Okay, Molly, could\n  you share your answer with us please? What happens to a red blood cell in pure\n  water?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Molly answers: A red blood cell would get bigger in pure water because it is\n  taking the water into it across it’s partially permeable membrane, because of\n  osmosis happening]\n</em>\n\n<em>Great, and what does the term osmosis mean? </em>\n\n<em>[</em>\n<em>\n  Molly answers: Osmosis is where water diffuses from an area of higher water\n  concentration to an area of low concentration]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Thank you, Molly. So that's an accurate definition, and you've made good use\n  of the word bank here. Is there anything on here that you could use instead of\n  the term get bigger? And try and put that into a full sentence for me.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Molly answers: the red blood cell would ‘swell up’]</em>\n\n<em>\n  There are lots of great things about Molly's answer. It's scientifically\n  correct, and she's described the direction the water will travel in and the\n  effect this will have on the cell. Also, she's used the key scientific\n  terminology here to describe what happens to the membrane. How could we\n  further improve Molly's answer? Use the words in the word bank, and take 30\n  seconds thinking time, off you go. So can we improve on Molly's answer using\n  the key terminology? Mitchell.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Mitchell answers: During osmosis, water diffuses from an area of higher water\n  concentration to an area of lower water concentration. A red blood cell in\n  pure water would swell up and eventually burst, known as lysis. This is\n  because the concentration of water is higher in the pure water when compared\n  to the red blood cell, and so the water will move into the red blood cell,\n  across its partially permeable membrane, until it cannot fit any more water\n  and bursts]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  That's great, thank you, Mitchell. So you added the key words, such as water\n  concentration, swell up, and lysis, and using these terms has really allowed\n  you to explain what happens during osmosis more accurately. Let's see if we\n  can get more of this key terminology into our answer. Where could we add\n  concentration gradient? I'll give you 30 seconds thinking time. Okay, can we\n  improve on Mitchell's answer using the term concentration gradient? Hannah.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Hannah’s answer: we can add it to the definition of osmosis, so, during\n  osmosis, water diffuses from an area of higher water concentration to an area\n  of lower water concentration, along its concentration gradient]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Perfect. So we've now demonstrated that we understand every aspect of osmosis,\n  and we can describe as well as explain what's happening. I'd now like you to\n  answer a similar question in your workbooks, and the question and the word\n  bank are in your books. Off you go.”\n</em>\n\nLet's unpack this model. First, I helped pupils achieve a high success rate by ensuring that the task was manageable. Pupils had a good understanding of osmosis and were able to explain it in their own words. This activity took them a step further using academic vocabulary to refine their thinking.\n\nSecondly, the scaffold I used supports pupils who need more structure early in their learning. As this is still new content, recalling what osmosis is and a wide range of scientific vocabulary, is a lot to hold onto at once. The word bank makes the task more accessible and enables them to come up with a more accurate definition. Importantly though, it doesn't get in the way of the thinking that I need them to do, recalling the process of osmosis.\n\nFinally, I thought about how to remove this scaffold. Once pupils are able to use this terminology fluently providing a word bank may hinder their thinking, and so it's important I take it away as soon as possible. Scaffolds are a useful support, but they shouldn't remain in place indefinitely.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have looked at how scaffolding can support pupil learning and provided\nsome examples of scaffolding in practice. Before we finish, read over the key ideas\nthat we have covered. Which of the following ideas do you think that the example\nillustrates the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Design practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough\n    support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting\n    challenging work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Use modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need\n    more structure early in a domain\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Remove scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success\n    in applying previously taught material\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nEffective scaffolding isn't about doing the thinking for our pupils. Instead, it\nmeans providing them with the extra support that they need to achieve ambitious\nlearning goals and removing it once they get there. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I9.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones is increasingly confident at using the I-We-You model to lead sequences of instruction. But he finds that some of his pupils become overwhelmed by new content and many pupils struggle when the ideas are abstract or complex. How can his instruction support pupils to be successful when tackling challenging material?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffective scaffolding gives pupils the knowledge and guidance to access challenging content but should be removed once pupils are experiencing high rates of success.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Knowledge, new content and the role of scaffolding\n\nMr Jones now understands that to learn new content pupils need to be able to process it in their working memory, but that working memory capacity is limited and varies between pupils (Gathercole et al., 2006). Related knowledge helps pupils make sense of new content (Willingham, 2009). For example, pupil vocabulary knowledge allows them to process strings of letters as sentences when reading and knowledge of phonics helps them when they encounter an unfamiliar word, reducing the demands on working memory. Prior knowledge reduces the burden on working memory and frees it up to think about more challenging concepts. Where prior knowledge is lacking, further support through scaffolding can help, for example by providing a definition and pronunciation of an unfamiliar key word. But where pupils already have this knowledge, scaffolding can get in the way of pupils using their prior knowledge (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\nPrior knowledge helps us to grasp related new ideas more easily, particularly if the new ideas are concrete, as most of the things we know are concrete. However, many of the ideas encountered at school are abstract, and distant from pupils’ everyday experiences (Willingham, 2009). When introducing abstract ideas, teachers can provide related scaffolds that make the ideas more concrete. This reduces the chances of working memory becoming overloaded, increasing the chances of pupil success. For example, the idea of adding fractions can be abstract, but we can make it more concrete by using objects or diagrams (Pashler et al., 2007).\n\n### Introducing scaffolding\n\nScaffolding can be introduced to support pupils to succeed with difficult tasks where they lack sufficient prior knowledge. Scaffolding involves breaking down tasks into manageable steps and providing temporary supports. This enables pupils to focus on and think about only certain aspects of the task at any one time, reducing the chances of working memory being overloaded.\n\nMr Jones should try to anticipate what his pupils with struggle with most, break down the task into manageable steps, and then decide what kinds of scaffolding he might put in place.\n\nHe can draw on a few different types of scaffold to support pupil thinking and make his ‘expert thinking’ explicit:\n\n- **Modelling:** For example, sharing an excellent piece of work or ‘thinking aloud’ through a problem (Rosenshine, 2012). Mr Jones can reduce the cognitive burden his pupils feel by directing pupil attention towards the key features of a problem or example. This can help them to break down a complex task into more manageable parts.\n- **Worked examples:** When introducing a new type of problem in maths, Mr Jones could break the problem down into steps instead of getting his pupils to attempt it in one go. He could then guide them through each step by providing prompts or explanations which would help the pupils succeed at each step. Worked examples reduce the number of options pupils need to think about by pointing them directly to successful approaches (Sweller, 2016).\n- **Guides:** Teachers can also anticipate common pupil mistakes and misconceptions and provide guides such as checklists as support to overcome these (Rosenshine, 2012). For example, when teaching his pupils creative writing, Mr Jones could give his pupils a checklist of things they should include. This means that pupils do not have to simultaneously think about both what they want to write and the complex devices they need to use. Checklists also support them to review their work to avoid common errors like leaving out full stops and misconceptions like every ‘s’ should have an apostrophe.\n\n### Removing scaffolding\n\nScaffolds need to be temporary to successfully support learning. As pupil knowledge develops, using fewer examples and more problem solving appears to improve learning, rather than continuing to provide high levels of guidance (Pashler et al., 2007). As pupils develop more knowledge, trying to process the scaffolding at the same time as drawing on their existing knowledge can overload working memory. As a result, scaffolding is best removed as pupils’ knowledge grows. Rather than removing all the scaffolds at once, however, Mr Jones can gradually ‘fade’ them out by removing support gradually, as pupils begin to experience higher success rates (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nEffective scaffolding increases the chances of pupils experiencing success and improves pupil motivation (Coe et al., 2014). Success should be a central guiding principle when deciding whether and when to remove scaffolding as pupil expertise increases.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nScaffolding alone cannot overcome limitations in pupil prior knowledge. Strategies like explicitly teaching content and allowing pupils to rehearse this new knowledge are necessary to ensure pupils have adequate knowledge (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can successfully scaffold his instruction if he understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Pupils will struggle and working memory will become overloaded if they do\n    not have relevant knowledge of new content – particularly if it is complex\n    or abstract.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Scaffolding can provide knowledge to support pupils to access new content\n    through modelling, worked examples and guides.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Scaffolding needs to be removed over time as it can become a barrier once\n    pupil knowledge is developed. However, a high success rate should be\n    maintained.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nRosenshine, B. (2012).

Questions can be used to develop understanding\nas well as to check understanding. Good questions can guide pupils' thinking and\nget them to draw upon what they know. They can also help teachers to see how knowledge\nis taking shape and if there are any gaps or misunderstandings. Whether you're designing\na question to develop understanding or to check it, teachers need to plan what they\nwill ask and know why they're asking it.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nQuestioning is a hugely important part of classroom practice. It's really important\nto have a clear purpose in mind when you ask a question. You're probably already\nasking your pupils lots of questions, but are you planning them carefully to ensure\nthat they're the best ones?\n\nEffective questions can help to develop pupil understanding by directing thinking or extending thinking. Questions can also help teachers to check what pupils understand. Teachers can use a range of different types of questions.\n\nFirst, let's think about questions that develop pupil thinking by helping to direct what they think about. Closed questions are questions where there's a specific answer. Closed questions can be used to get pupils to recall prior knowledge. How many children did Henry the Eighth have? They can help pupils to notice important details. Where is the topic sentence in this paragraph? And closed questions can help pupils to connect concrete ideas to abstract ones. A key concept in maths is that it doesn't matter what order you add things up in, the answer would always be the same. This is an abstract concept called commutative property. A concrete idea that helps pupils to understand this is to add up two sets of beads. As they do so, a teacher might ask these specific questions,<em> \"show on your fingers what answer do you get if you add these three beads to these seven beads? 10, let's switch round the order, what answer do you get, if you add these seven beads to these three beads? 10 again. Does it matter what order you add the beads up in? Daniel? What can you tell me about the order that we can add numbers up in? We were talking about it yesterday. Casia?\"</em> Questions about the beads, a concrete support, help pupils to understand commutative property, this abstract concept.\n\nSecond, teachers can ask questions that extend pupil thinking by asking open-ended questions. Open-ended questions have more than one answer. One fairly straight forward type of open-ended question is to use the word why. In an earlier setting for example, a teacher might interact with the pupil during play and ask a question like, why did you choose to add a tower to your castle? There could be many different reasons, unique to each pupil. These open-ended questions can help pupil to share their opinions, reflect on and understand themselves. Open questions can push pupils to draw upon more of their knowledge. What impact did the opening of the international fast food chain have on Nigeria? How does Shakespeare present Lady Macbeth's relationship with Macbeth in this scene? Explain why the stone sinks, but the boat floats? In order to ask these questions accurately pupils will need to draw on a wide body of knowledge and teachers should think carefully about the knowledge a question requires.\n\nFinally, teachers can use questions to check for understanding. To be effective, teachers need to know what specific content they're testing for. What knowledge do they want to see if their pupils have? What misconceptions are they checking for? When designing your question include the subject specific vocabulary that you want pupils to acquire and remind them to use specific language in their answer. For example, in a key stage one class on pollination, you might ask,<em> \"what part of the flower does pollen need to move to during pollination?\"</em> Making reference to explicit vocabulary expected helps you to check pupils' understanding more precisely. With a finite amount of time on their hands, teachers need to have a clear purpose in mind when designing questions.\n\nAnd whether your question is to develop understanding or to check for understanding, you need to get all of your pupils to think about the answer. When teachers ask a question to one pupil, it can be tempting for others to switch off, but in order to learn, pupils need to think. Teachers need to establish a clear expectation that everyone tries to answer the questions that they hear, even if they're not called on to answer. One way that teachers can do this is to ask a question to the whole class; naming the pupil after you've asked the question means more pupils are likely to think about the answer than when teachers direct a question to one pupil. So instead of saying, <em>\"Ryan, how many sizes a square have?\" </em>It's better to say, <em>\"How many sides does a square have? Ryan?\"</em> This tiny switch can make a huge difference, particularly if pupils understand why teachers are taking this approach and if the routine has been set up effectively, for instance, <em>\"no hands up, we all need to think.\" </em>You also need to leave enough time between asking a question and getting the answer so that pupils can think about their response carefully. Try counting one, two, three in your head after you pose a question.\n\nGood questions can significantly enhance both the quality and the accuracy of pupil thought. Think carefully about the primary function of your question, what you will ask and how your deliver it.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn this example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model how to ask a series\nof questions to check for understanding. As you watch focus on the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Structures tasks and questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Checks that pupils have a secure understanding by encouraging them to\n    elaborate when responding to questions\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplificatin: Ambition Institute coach</h3>I want you to imagine I'm\nteaching a year 12 English lesson. We will be learning about John Keats' ddes\nand today we returned to the poem To Autumn. We've defined odes as lyrical poems\nthat celebrate people, places, things, or ideas. We've also considered that\npoets have purposes for their art and that case is presenting an argument in\ndefence of season of autumn. We have a routine of no hands up in the class and\nall pupils expect to be called upon. Pupils have just completed an activity\nwhere they've worked independently to identify the imagery that tells about\nKeats' perspective on autumn. Now I'm checking for understanding to assess\nwhether pupils are right to move on to the next phase of instruction.\n\n<em>\n  “Right. I'm going to ask you some questions now, so listen carefully and\n  remember hands down. What is an ode?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives correct definition of an ode]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Reese, absolutely, an ode is a lyrical poem that celebrates people, places,\n  things or ideas. Reese, can you give me an example of where Keats is\n  celebrating autumn in the poem?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Pupil answer: swollen gourds and ‘plump’ hazel. They are full and ready to\n  burst]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Right, the first stanza, the strophe is celebratory tone. And last lesson, we\n  also said that Keats seems to go even further by being almost like a defence\n  for autumn, such as not following lines here: “where are the songs of spring,\n  Ay, where are they? Think not of them thou hast thy music too.” Keats seems to\n  be celebrating and defending autumn against the other seasons here.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now let's take a look at this quatrain from the second stanza, the\n  antistrophe: “and sometimes like a gleaner thou does keep, steady thy laden\n  head across a brook; or by a cyder-press with patient look, thou watchest the\n  last oozings hours by hours.” I find these lines somewhat paradoxical in tone,\n  why is that? Bola?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Pupil answers: on the one hand there is a bit of a feeling of tiredness and\n  things coming to an end, and on the other hand the ode is rejoicing in things\n  coming into life]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Great, we still see the celebration of autumn, despite some of the language\n  choices, for example, laden and oozings. And also that extra 11th line in each\n  stanza, Bola, so we said that when something is paradoxical, it contradicts\n  another aspect. Is there anything else here that feels contradictory or out of\n  place to the rest of the celebratory tone that would expect in an ode?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Pupil answers: it feels like autumn is moving quite slowly, it steadies its\n  hand and gives a ‘patient’ look. This is different from the energy of some of\n  the fruits bursting into life]{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So there is an authentic tone as if awaiting for something to happen, linking\n  to the somnambulistic imagery that we came across earlier in the stanza, for\n  example, sound asleep and drowsed. And though Keats celebrates autumn in this\n  moment and wants to capture it, the last oozings hours by hours that will give\n  way to winter soon. And we said that this is a typical trope of Keats' poetry\n  and his fears of middle age and death.\"{\" \"}\n</em>\n\nI want you to draw your attention to a couple of things in that model.\n\nFirstly, you may have noticed I paused and scanned the room before identifying the pupil that I wanted to answer the question. This is for a few reasons. It gave everyone time to think about the response, as they didn't know who I was going to ask and it meant that I could check that everyone was listening to me and thinking. I wanted to check that pupils knew what an ode was and to ensure that their understanding was secure. My initial questions check that they could identify the features of an ode and then I asked them to explain where they could see this in the poem before moving on.\n\nI also checked for specific knowledge gaps and misconceptions. When learning about odes, students often miss the complexities and nuance in tone, for example, only looking for where the poem is celebratory. I wanted students to both consider the main aspects of Keats' argument and this important definition of an ode, but I also wanted to develop their understanding of the details that are more subtle and the link to the poet's purpose across the odes they've studied.\n\nWhen planning questions, I find that it helps to do it in reverse. First I decide what I want to check for then I design a question and finally, I test out the question on myself to make sure that it targets specifically what I wanted it to. This helps me get the most out of questioning in the classroom.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video we have considered the different purposes thst questions can serve\nand how to deliver them in the classroom. Before we finish, take a moment now to\nread over the key ideas. Which ideas did the example best illustrate?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps\n    and misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and\n    challenge pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more\n    developed responses are required\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Prompt pupils to elaborate on their answers to check that a correct answer\n    stems from secure understanding\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nEffective teachers ask lots of questions during their teaching, but perhaps more\nimportantly, they don't do this at random. To get the most out of questions, you\nneed to know why you're asking them and design them carefully. Really good\nquestions benefit from advanced planning. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I10.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Aswin feels confident he can lead I-We-You (Lemov, 2015) sequences and help pupils access and practise complex content. However, he notices that pupils are getting used to being ‘spoon fed’ and are quite dependent on him to do the ‘hard thinking’ before they get to independent practice. How can his instruction transfer more of the thinking onto pupils earlier in the learning sequence?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffective questioning can guide pupil thinking through checking understanding, extending pupil thinking and fostering high-quality talk in a supportive classroom environment.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Checking for understanding\n\nQuestioning is an essential tool for teachers to master as it can be used for many purposes (Coe et al., 2014). For example, it is among the most effective ways for Mr Ashwin to elicit what his pupils are thinking (Black & Wiliam, 2009). Sometimes Mr Ashwin checks pupil understanding by asking questions which demand short, simple answers. For example, he may want to see if pupils have enough fluent prior knowledge by asking ‘what is 8 x 7?’ Targeting questions at several pupils could also help Mr Ashwin make an inference about current class understanding and any common misconceptions.\n\nSuch questioning is diagnostic: it is primarily about finding out what pupils know rather than building pupil knowledge (Black & Wiliam, 2009). However, things can go wrong if the questions don’t check the right things or if only a few pupils are questioned and information from these answers determines the subsequent direction of the lesson. Teachers can also inadvertently ignore the information generated from questions if they have not planned carefully when to pose them and how to respond to them. When planning questions to check pupil understanding, Mr Ashwin should consider:\n\n- What is the key knowledge that I need to check in this lesson? What do pupils need to be secure in before I can move on? What will they say and do if they are secure with this?\n- What is the best way to get the widest sample of answers? For example, mini whiteboards, exit tasks or post-it notes cans help quickly gather information about most of the class.\n- What are the wrong answers and misconceptions that might arise in the lesson? How will I prepare to address them?\n\n### Extending pupil thinking\n\nQuestioning can help Mr Ashwin develop pupil thinking as well as check it. Studies have shown that more effective teachers ask more questions and often require pupils to give extended explanations of their thought process (Rosenshine, 2012).\n\nSequences of open questions can help to manage pupils’ limited working memory. For example, when introducing a maths problem Mr Ashwin could ask:\n\n‘What would we do first?’\n\n‘Why would we do this first?’\n\n‘Once we have done that, what might we do next? Why’\n\nSuch questions require pupils to explain their answers which encourages pupils to think about the underlying principles of learning, deepening and consolidating their knowledge (Pashler et al., 2007). These questions are more effective when pupils have grasped key ideas first (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nOpen ended questions can also help to extend pupil thinking. Pupils might be asked to make predictions about a book’s story from its title or to reason about a story, for example ‘why did Winnie-the-Pooh get stuck in the rabbit hole?’ (EEF, 2018).\n\n### Ensuring quality answers\n\nTo ensure quality answers, questioning should allow enough ‘thinking time’. Research suggests that after asking a question many teachers wait less than one second and, if no answer is given, ask another question or answer the question themselves (Black et al., 2004). Pupils with lower working memory capacities are likely to struggle the most with limited time and preparation (Gathercole et al., 2006), making it more likely class contributions are from higher achievers. A longer wait and time to prepare an answer can lead to more detailed answers and higher-quality thinking from every pupil.\n\nMr Ashwin could also use questioning to encourage pupils to share answers with their peers, supporting them to articulate key ideas and extend their vocabulary. Effective teachers spend more time on questioning pupils and guiding practice in this way than their less effective peers (Rosenshine, 2012). Teachers who facilitate such talk increase pupil outcomes (Jay et al., 2017). For talk to be effective, Mr Ashwin needs to bear in mind:\n\n- **Pupils need enough knowledge for high-quality talk:** Questioning can offer pupils opportunities to practise new ideas, which can be particularly useful after teacher input and before independent practice, in the ‘We do’ section.\n- **Questions can increase the quality of pupil talk:** When conducting questioning, clear teacher expectations and scaffolding are important to support high-quality talk. Teachers can use questions to consolidate technical vocabulary, clarify how to structure answers and to encourage pupils to address other pupils’ misconceptions. (Jay et al., 2017).\n- **The learning environment needs to be safe and secure:** Pupil behaviour and outcomes are affected by teacher expectations and what they see other pupils doing (IES, 2008). Mr Ashwin needs to ensure behavioural expectations are enforced to ensure pupils feel safe to contribute answers when called upon through questioning. He needs to insist on mutual trust and respect and be clear that his purpose of questioning is pupil learning, rather than, for example, to catch pupils out.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nGreat questioning is often delivered on the spot by experienced teachers and is the product of deep knowledge of their subject and their pupils. This knowledge takes time to acquire so, to be as effective, newer teachers can plan out some of their key questions in advance.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nTo use questioning to support pupil thinking, Mr Ashwin needs to understand that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Questioning has many purposes for teachers, including checking pupil\n    understanding, breaking down problems and extending and challenging pupil\n    thinking.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Pupils need enough knowledge, guidance and thinking time to produce quality\n    answers.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Questioning underpins quality pupil classroom talk, especially in the ‘We\n    do’ part of instruction.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBlack, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., & Wiliam, D.

Meaningful classroom\ntalk helps pupils to rehearse ideas, check their understanding, and develop their\nknowledge. To get the best out of this, classroom talk needs to be carefully planned\nand delivered. It will take time and practice, but getting classroom talk right can\nbe a rewarding experience for both pupils and teachers.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nEffective classroom talk can help pupils to think when teachers plan it carefully\nand set it up well. When pupils are engaged in well-structured talk it can help them\nto develop their understanding in lots of different ways. It can help pupils to retrieve\npreviously learned material, connect new content to existing knowledge and extend\ntheir vocabulary. Classroom talk can support learning when it's planned with care.\n\nA good starting point for planning classroom talk is to ask yourself, what do I want my pupils to think hard about? If you're clear about the purpose of classroom talk when you plan it, it's more likely to be effective. Do you want pupils to recall some existing knowledge, like what capacity and volume mean? In this case, you might ask pupils to test each other. Or do you want pupils to connect new content to existing knowledge? An example here might be asking pupils to look at where rainforest is on a map and share their predictions about its climate, drawing on their knowledge about the equator. Or do you want pupil to reveal their thinking steps so they can practice getting them right? In this case you might get one pupil to explain what they're doing to another.\n\nOnce you've designed a classroom talk activity try testing it out quickly to see whether it requires pupils to think about what you want them to or not. Effective classroom talk should be matched to what pupils need to learn. There are a couple of other key questions that teachers can address at the planning stage:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    Do my pupils have the necessary knowledge with which to engage in this\n    activity?\n  </li>\n  <li>Do they require any further support?</li>\n</ol>\nIn order to increase the rigour and focus of classroom talk, pupils need to have\nsomething to talk about. They need to have some knowledge to draw on. They may also\nneed some scaffolds to guide their talk and keep it on task. Talking frames and vocabulary\nbanks can be a good way of improving the quality of classroom talk.\n\nOnce teachers have planned the classroom talk they need to set it up too. Teachers need to provide clear task instructions which include how they want pupils to behave. This might mean asking pupils to turn and face each other, identifying which person talks first and who will be responsible for feeding back to the class. Establishing good routines for classroom talk helps pupils to pay attention.\n\nOne important thing to bear in mind about classroom talk activities is that it can be difficult to get an accurate picture of what every pupil in the class is thinking. When teachers circulate and listen to pupils talk, they need to think carefully about what they hear before they make any decisions that are based on it. It might be totally obvious that the whole class has misunderstood the task, in which case it'll be well worth stopping it and clarifying. But if you hear one or two pupils make a mistake, that won't show you whether the whole class has made the same error or not. Instead, you want to choose a method of questioning that gives you a much bigger sample size before you decide on what to do next.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will watch an Ambition Institute coach model how to set\nup a group talk activity. As you watch pay particular attention to how they do the\nfollowing:\n<ul>\n  <li>Plans activities around what pupils need to think hard about</li>\n  <li>\n    Provides scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of\n    dialogue\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, I'm going to model how we can support effective group talk. I\nwant you to imagine I'm teaching a year six science lesson. They'd been learning\nhow to identify and name the parts of the human circulatory system and know how\nblood is pumped around the body. I've designed this activity to give pupils the\nchance to recall different parts of the circulatory system and think about how\nthey work. By circulating during the activity, monitoring pupils' talk and using\ncold call at the end of the activity, it will allow me to gather data on the\ndepth of pupils' understanding and identify any remaining misconceptions pupils\nmay have which I can then address. Pupils have worked in groups and pairs\nbefore, but it is still important for me to remind them of the expectations when\nworking in a group.\n\n<em>\n  “So we're going to have five minutes in total for this discussion. I'd like\n  you to consider which of the following statements is true and why?{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>A. If you stand on your head your feet won’t get any blood</em>\n\n<em>B. If you stand on your head more blood will go to your head</em>\n\n<em>C. If you stand on your head your heart will need to pump harder</em>\n\n<em>\n  D. If you stand on your head, it won’t make any difference to your heart or\n  your blood circulation{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I'm going to leave these statements up on the board, throughout your\n  discussion. There are also some words I'd expect to hear as I'm listening to\n  your discussion. And these are on the board as well. So we have heart,\n  circulate, blood vessels, transport, oxygen, gravity, and pressure.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I'm going to model what I would like to see during your discussion using a\n  slightly different statement. So the statement I'm considering is, if you\n  raise your hand, your heart will need to pump harder. So Rubia, in the\n  discussion, might say, “I agree with that statement” and she would give her\n  reasons why. And Bethany might then say, well, “I disagree with that\n  statement” and she would give her reasons why. And they would continue to\n  discuss and come to an agreement on that statement.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I'd like us to remember our classroom rules for discussion as we go through\n  this activity. Number one: all members of the group must contribute. Number\n  two: every contribution is treated with respect. It's listened to without\n  interruption, and it's allowed to finish. Number three: each group will come\n  to an agreement about the statements. And that might mean that you need to\n  resolve some differences. And number four: every suggestion a member makes\n  must be justified. So say what you think and why.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Some of you will make mistakes and that's normal. The purpose of this is to\n  help me check what you know. So if you've forgotten something or you make an\n  error, we can correct it. If your partner says something you think is wrong,\n  you need to firstly listen and politely state what you think is wrong. You\n  might say, “I disagree with that, and I think that's wrong because”, and \"I\n  think the right way is\". And then you would politely state your point.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  To begin with, I'm going to give you one minute independent thinking time. And\n  then we will have four minutes on the main discussion. I'll be circulating the\n  room and your one minute thinking time starts now.”\n</em>\n\nI want to draw your attention to a few things in that model.  First, I planned the activity around what I want pupils to think hard about: the different features of the circulatory system and how they function. Pupils learnt this content earlier in the lesson, and this is a good opportunity to consolidate their understanding. The task is designed to match the thinking that I want to encourage. By asking pupils to come to an agreement, they are forced to justify their answers and draw upon existing knowledge and connect it to this concrete example.\n\nI put appropriate scaffolds in place to improve the focus and the rigour of the dialogue. Pupils were given time to think on their own before they start talking. And I provided them with a vocabulary bank to improve the accuracy of that talk. I also modelled how they might engage in this discussion to demonstrate that they need to use the words from the vocabulary bank to explain their response.\n\nThe task instructions were specific and sequential, and I gave clear behavioural expectations: pupils should be treated with respect by allowing each person to finish their thought without interruption. All of this guidance helps to ensure that this talk activity will support pupils to think hard and learn.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have considered the purpose of classroom talk and how to ensure\nthat it's effective.

How can she keep pupils talking ‘on-task’ and what groups are best for pupils to learn in? How can Ms Crosby best support talk and thinking that underpins pupil learning?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can promote pupil learning by giving clear expectations and setting up routines for high-quality classroom talk in pairs and groups.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Classroom talk supports pupil learning\n\nWhen pupils have enough knowledge, high-quality talk can support them to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend vocabulary. Where pupils discuss concepts with peers, talk reduces individual cognitive load by distributing information across the group, making it more likely pupils will gain new insights into the discussed material (Kirschner et al., 2018).\n\nThrough talk, pupils refine their understanding of concepts they are learning about (Jay et al., 2017). It can also provide the opportunity for pupils to rehearse ideas and new vocabulary orally before committing them to paper. However, talk can only succeed where pupils have sufficient knowledge, skills and capabilities linked to a topic or problem, and where clear routines have been established. Talk tasks should not be introduced too early in an instructional sequence.\n\n### Facilitating high-quality classroom talk\n\nOpportunities to introduce classroom talk might include:\n\n- When checking pupil understanding, first giving pupils the chance to talk (for example pair talk) before taking a variety of pupil responses.\n- Posing challenging questions which might require pupils to explain something to the teacher or to their partners, deepening their understanding of the material discussed.\n- Guided discussions, for example during the ‘We Do’ part of the lesson, with teacher prompts guiding pupils’ discussions so they elaborate on one another’s ideas (Mercer & Dawes, in EEF, 2017).\n\nHigh-quality talk is underpinned by clear behavioural expectations. By reinforcing and practising these, Ms Crosby can build positive habits for how pupils engage with one another, reducing the risk of inappropriate behaviour (IES, 2008). In addition to clear behavioural expectations, Ms Crosby should ensure talk is:\n\n- **Collective:** Teacher and all pupils are involved in the dialogue.\n- **Reciprocal:** Participants listen carefully to each other.\n- **Supportive:** Contributions are valued and respected.\n- **Cumulative:** Talk builds on others’ contributions towards answering an open-ended question.\n- **Purposeful:** Building towards a meaningful learning goal (Alexander, 2018).\n\nWhen pupils know the rules of engagement for classroom talk, for example how long they are to talk for and what each person should be doing, they are freed up to think about the material they are learning rather than behaviour.\n\n### Whole class, paired and group discussion\n\nMs Crosby may wish to start with whole class discussion so she can support pupils and embed her expectations. As a culture of effective talk develops, Ms Crosby may feel confident about setting up first pairs and then groups for pupils to discuss content together for increasing periods of time. Groupings can affect pupil behaviour and motivation (Tereshenko et al., 2018). Therefore, Ms Crosby should pre-plan groupings, but ensure that they are flexible, and monitor groups’ impacts on pupil learning and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.\n\nSome rules for pair and group work that Ms Crosby might consider introducing are:\n\n- **All group members must contribute:** This helps to avoid some pupils relying on others to complete group tasks. Team members should encourage those who are saying less (with the caveat being that teachers should monitor groups, as pupils who are not speaking may be doing so because they lack the foundational knowledge needed to contribute and therefore require further explicit teaching).\n- **Every contribution should be treated with respect:** Partners should listen thoughtfully and allow the speaker to finish.\n- **Each group must achieve consensus by the end of the activity:** Teachers may need to resolve differences.\n- **Every suggestion a member makes should be justified:** Pupils should say both what they think and why they think it (Mercer et al., 2004, in EEF, 2018).\n\nAs with all expectations, Ms Crosby should circulate to monitor and reinforce these rules (IES, 2008). Crucially, the success of classroom talk is reliant on ensuring several things: that pupils have enough knowledge to engage meaningfully in discussions, that they have the guidance and support to undertake meaningful talk tasks, and that they have opportunities to practise.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nPair and group work needs to be explicitly taught, scaffolded and practised like all effective learning (Rosenshine, 2012). Attempting to help pupils discover new ideas for themselves through talk without adequate support is likely to be ineffective (Coe et al., 2014).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Crosby can facilitate high quality classroom talk if she understands that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Classroom talk can support pupil learning and is a form of ‘practising’ new\n    ideas.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can develop successful pupil talk by establishing clear routines\n    and expectations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can establish effective whole class, pair and group talk through\n    pre-planning and supporting pupil groups.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nJay, T., Willis, B., Thomas, P., Taylor, R., Moore, N., Burnett, C., Merchant, G. & Stevens, A.

There are many ways in which teachers can give effective feedback,\nand they don't have to take up a huge amount of time. Verbal feedback in lessons\ncan be effective, but when it's planned and delivered well, pupils will know how\nto act from the feedback you give them. Good feedback helps pupils to move from where\nthey are now, to where you want them to be.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nFeedback is about sharing information with pupils to change either their effort or\nthe goals of their work. This can be specific to the task, the areas of learning\nor to do with pupils' self-regulation. Effective feedback shows pupils what success\nlooks like in a task or problem, where they are in relation to that success, and\nwhat practical steps they can take to close that gap. Feedback of this type can help\npupils to monitor and evaluate their own learning. For example, in a numeracy class,\nreminding pupils that they can use their fingers to add up two numbers provides them\nwith a specific strategy that they can use and check for when they do the task again.\nOr when competing an addition sentence, showing them an example that accurately uses\nthe equals sign and an example that misses this out can help them to come up with\na better judgment about their own work and identify a specific way to improve. Pupils\ncan then apply this feedback when they try the task again. Over time, feedback that\nshows pupils where they are going, how they are doing, and what they need to do next,\ncan help them to self-regulate their learning.\n\nThere are a number of key ideas that teachers need to bear in mind when planning and implementing feedback. The first is to do with ensuring that pupils can act upon your feedback: it's important to make feedback manageable. Whilst there may be lots of different things your pupils need to do to improve, they can only focus on a few things at a time. Identify one or two specific actions for pupils to do, model how to make those improvements, and make sure that you provide them time to act on the feedback. Feedback that is concrete and clear can be particularly helpful. For example, telling pupils to, <em>\"Offer a more thoughtful analysis of Macbeth's character by discussing his doubts as well as his determination\",</em> will be better than telling pupils to, <em>\"Expand on your points with more thorough analysis of Macbeth's character.\"</em>\n\nEqually, giving direct feedback that gets to the point quickly works well. Try reducing the amount of words that you use so that you focus pupils’ attention on what matters most. In PE for example, pupils will have a better understanding of what to improve if you say, <em>\"Try again, this time put all your weight on your left foot\"</em>, instead of, <em>\"I want you to have another go at that, and this time when you're coming to your run-up, remember to place all your weight on your left foot.\" </em>\n\nAnd remember to give pupils enough time to use feedback to improve their work. In order for feedback to work, pupils need to understand it and be able to act upon it.\n\nAnother consideration is how to make feedback appealing to pupils. Some pupils respond better than others to feedback. The reasons for this are often to do with complex social factors, and teachers need to be sensitive to this. When giving feedback, show pupils improving work is a normal and continual part of learning by reminding them that the purpose of giving feedback is to help them to get better. Use a neutral tone so that the feedback doesn't feel personal or judgemental.\n\nSo far, we've talked about how teachers can support pupils to get the best out of feedback, but it's important to ensure that feedback is manageable for teachers too. Many teachers spend a lot of time writing detailed, written comments on pupil work, and this isn't always the best approach. Try using verbal feedback during lessons, in place of written feedback after lessons, where possible.\n\nAnother way to make the best use of your time is to prioritize feedback that will benefit the majority of the class. That means checking if pupils hold common misconceptions, as well as identifying trends in pupil work. Good feedback can have a significant impact on pupil learning, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to respond to every single thing that your pupils have done in a lesson. Giving effective feedback involves focusing on the things that pupils can do to make the most impact on their learning.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see an Ambition Institute coach model a way of giving\nverbal feedback to the whole class. As you watch, pay attention to how they do the\nfollowing:\n<ul>\n  <li>Focuses on common misconceptions</li>\n  <li>\n    Provides specific actions for pupils, and enough time for pupils to respond\n    to feedback\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, I'm going to model how we can give whole class feedback to\naddress misconceptions and provide specific actions for pupils to improve. Now,\nthis is a year nine RE class, who have been studying Christian beliefs. They've\nbeen practicing writing paragraphs that follow a 'point, evidence and explain'\nformat. And in their most recent assessments, pupils were asked to explain what\nChristians believe about salvation. And I noticed that lots of the pupils\ndemonstrated a common misconception, that the Bible was written by Jesus. In\nthis model, I'm going to zoom in on the moment where I am identifying this\nmisconception, and I'm using a model answer to show them what good looks like.\n\n<em>\n  “So, what we've got on the board here is a good example of how to quote from\n  the Bible. I'll read it out for you. So we see in the Bible, in the book of\n  John, where it says, \"For God loved the world so that he gave his one and only\n  son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\"{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now, what I've seen in some of your responses when you've been quoting the\n  Bible, is that you've used the phrase, Jesus says. And unfortunately, this is\n  incorrect, because the Bible was written by lots of different people, inspired\n  by the Holy Spirit. And although the New Testament does focus on Jesus' life\n  and teachings, it was actually written after his death, by people who were not\n  around during his life. And it's actually more accurate to use one of the\n  following: in the Bible, it says, the Bible teaches that, or according to the\n  Bible. And then you can also refer to the book where that reference is found.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now, look back at your own work and make sure that you've cited the Bible\n  correctly. I'm going to give you three minutes to do that, and I'll leave the\n  phrases on the board to help you.”\n</em>\n\nSo let's focus on a couple of features within this model. First, I prioritized giving feedback about a common misconception that many pupils have with regards to Christianity, that Jesus wrote the Bible or that Jesus, at least, wrote the New Testament. And this is something that pupil often get wrong. Now understanding who wrote the Bible and when it was written, is crucial to understanding the beliefs and practices of Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, and is a concept that pupils need to master. And therefore it's an important misconception to address.\n\nSecond, I gave pupils a specific action to improve their work. They had to identify how they had cited evidence from the Bible, and make sure that they had done so correctly. Pupils then had time to act on feedback in the lesson, with sentence starters to help them to be accurate. You'll notice how my feedback was brief and to the point, and I delivered it in a neutral tone. I want pupils to act on my feedback quickly, and recognize that this is something that all learners need to do to improve.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've considered how feedback can support pupil learning, and some\nof the ways in which teachers can deliver feedback effectively. Before we finish,\ntake a moment to reflect on the key ideas of the video. Which of the following ideas\ndo you think the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced\n    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Focusing on specific actions for pupils and providing time for pupils to\n    respond to feedback\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after\n    lessons where possible\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when\n    using peer- or self-assessment\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nFeedback is one of the most important tools that we have as a teacher. It can\nhave a profound and positive impact on our pupils. Proper implementation can\ngive pupils the support they need and encourage them to ultimately monitor their\nown learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_I12.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Kearney is confident when leading the class in instructional sequences that support pupils to make sense of new material. However, pupils sometimes still need input to clarify misunderstandings and correct mistakes. How can Ms Kearney efficiently provide feedback through her instruction to support pupil learning?\n\n## Key idea\n\nFeedback helps pupils to improve and to manage their own learning. Effective feedback should be deployed after considering its benefits and costs and allow pupils the opportunity to respond.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Accurate and helpful feedback\n\nUsed effectively, feedback can have a significant impact on pupil learning (EEF, 2018). However, it requires care and attention to ensure feedback is helpful. Done badly, teacher feedback can actually inhibit learning (Kluger & De Nisi, 1996).\n\nThere are many types of feedback, all of which have strengths and weaknesses. A key feature of effective feedback is that its _content_ helps a pupil to answer at least one of three questions:\n\n- **Where am I going?** What does success look like in this problem or area?\n- **How am I doing?** Relative to success, where am I?\n- **Where to next?** What practical steps can I take to close the gap? (Hattie & Timperley, 2007).\n\nWhile teachers often choose to give written feedback, we have little evidence that this is effective for long term pupil outcomes. It is also highly time-consuming (EEF, 2016). Therefore, Ms Kearney should first use the questions above to ensure the content of feedback is useful. She can then decide the most time efficient method to deliver this feedback – written or verbal – rather than assuming written marking is best.\n\nSelf and peer feedback linked to these questions is far more time efficient than written teacher marking. However, it is difficult for novices to assess quality or give feedback on complex tasks (Christodoulou, 2017). Therefore, Ms Kearney might consider encouraging pupils to feed back on more straightforward tasks and to scaffold this with a checklist to support those who need it.\n\nWhole-class feedback involves teachers reviewing all pupils’ work and identifying common misconceptions and errors, before feeding back to the whole class. It is not necessarily tailored to individual needs. However, addressing misconceptions is important for pupil learning and is significantly quicker than written marking (Quigley, 2018).\n\nMs Kearney must be careful not to overwhelm pupils with too much negative feedback; if pupils do not believe they can be successful they may avoid the task completely (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996).\n\n### Feedback supports pupils to manage their own learning\n\nOver time, effective feedback helps pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning (EEF, 2017). Feedback allows pupils to monitor their current performance and understanding. If pupils have a good grasp of their current performance and a clear sense of their goal, then they should increasingly be able to judge how well they are doing and to regulate their learning by identifying what they need to do to improve.\n\nHowever, pupils can become dependent on feedback when it is given too frequently (Soderstrom & Bjork, in Hendrick & Macpherson, 2018). Additionally, where pupils are frequently given grades as part of their feedback, they can become preoccupied with ‘how I am doing?’ over ‘where to next?’ (EEF, 2016). Finally, pupils will only act on feedback if they believe they can be successful (Kluger & De Nisi, 1996). Ms Kearney must not only provide accurate feedback but also create time in her lessons to ensure her pupils are able to act on it.\n\n### Deciding whether to give feedback\n\nFeedback is part of effective assessment practice (Christodoulou, 2017). However, doing it properly can be time-consuming so Ms Kearney must factor this into her decision about when and whether to give feedback.\n\nIf Ms Kearney decides she will give feedback, she needs to be clear what format it will take. For example, if she wants to provide individualised written feedback on extended writing, it will require a lot of her time. She might choose this approach if the feedback is very important but she should also plan significant time for pupils to respond. Dedicated feedback lessons can only be afforded sparingly as there is a curriculum to teach, so these may need to be identified in advance as good assessment practice always has a clear idea about the decision it will be used to support before assessment occurs.\n\nA more efficient approach might be to assess pupil misconceptions through a short exit task. If designed well, analysing the proportion of correct responses could be much quicker and Ms Kearney can then decide to either feed back by reteaching the content, or just move on. Ms Kearney could alternatively feed back to individuals or small groups of pupils who answered incorrectly at an opportune moment during the next lesson.\n\nConsidering options for feedback before assessing pupils is effective practice (Wiliam & Leahy, 2015). Ms Kearney should ask herself the following questions in order to make good decisions about how and when to offer pupils feedback:\n\n- Before I set a task, what will my teaching options be? Is feedback appropriate?\n- If feedback is appropriate, what approaches are there?\n- Of these approaches, bearing in mind my limited time, which is the most efficient for pupil learning?\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nFeedback and marking are often conflated. Marking is only one type of feedback and has significant downsides in terms of teacher time and the ability of pupils to act on it (EEF, 2016). Marking should be thought of as only one of a number of teacher feedback strategies, each with particular pros and cons.\n\nData from feedback only needs to be recorded when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes. It is usually more beneficial to ensure pupils have received accurate and helpful feedback that they then act upon.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Kearney can use feedback to support pupil learning by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    High-quality feedback, written or verbal, is ambitious and specific about\n    how to improve.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Over time, feedback supports pupils to monitor and regulate their own\n    learning.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Before setting an assessment, teachers need to decide whether feedback will\n    be given and be able to justify their decision.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBlack, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., & Wiliam, D.

This strand is a combination of two areas, curriculum\nand assessment, because curriculum and assessment go hand in hand. The better that\nteachers know what they're teaching, the best order they should teach it in, and\nthe ways of strengthening what pupils know, the more they will be able to support\ntheir pupils to develop their capabilities and understanding. This is what it means\nto understand your curriculum.\n\nBut teachers also need to find ways of regularly checking how learning is going and ensure that they adapt their teaching in response. This is the role of assessment. Across this strand you will develop your responses to a number of key questions. What am I teaching? How can I make that learning secure? How will I know if my pupils are getting it? And what will I do if they're not?\n\n<h3>Presenter: Harry Fletcher-Wood</h3>\nCurriculum involves learning about your subject in depth, its core ideas and how\nthey're organized. Through access to a broad and balanced curriculum, pupils are\nable to develop the knowledge, skills, and values that will enable them to succeed\nin school and beyond. Understanding curriculum means understanding what you're teaching\nand the best order to teach it in. This allows you to share this learning journey\nwith your pupils. Thinking about the curriculum that you're delivering is a rewarding\nprocess, especially when you work with experienced subject specialists within your\nschool.\n\nAssessment is all about checking what your pupils have understood and adapting your teaching based on what you find out. It's one of the most fascinating areas that teachers can explore. You've designed this great lesson, you've taught it really well, but what happened? Did they get it? Do you need to go back and reteach anything? Effective assessment is about revealing pupil thinking so that you can check how learning is going.\n\n<h3>Presenter: Chloe Wardle</h3>\nIn the first half of this strand, you will learn how to identify what you are teaching,\nwhere pupils may go wrong, and how to deepen pupil understanding. In the second half\nof the strand, you will learn about the best ways of assessing what pupils have learned\nand how to adapt your teaching in response.\n\nAlongside a written evidence summary, there will be a video to watch each week. This will give you an overview of the content to provide a framework for your thinking. It will also provide you with a concrete model of how you might transfer some of the ideas into practice. You may choose to test out the model in a coaching session or in your teaching. When you do, remember that you will need to adapt what you see to your own context. Video models may not be subject or phase specific, depending on what you teach, but they will exemplify key ideas that are relevant to all.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S1.pdf){/button}\n\n## **Read | Strand introduction**\n\nWelcome to the _Subject_ strand of the programme. This strand invites you to consider your planning and assessment through the lens of the subject or phase that you work in. It explores evidence and practice in curriculum and assessment in ways that will be of benefit now but will also be useful as your progress through your career.\n\nBy the end of this stand you will have explored:\n\n- The curriculum and what it demands of the individual teacher.\n- Your mental model of the subject/phase you teach – breaking down your own understanding – and its implications for your planning.\n- How we can know what pupils have understood, the barriers we face in doing so and how we respond to their needs.\n\nIn _Instruction_ we asked you to explore some ‘rules of thumb’ of teaching. In _Subject_ we will apply the same rules in more detail and look at how _what_ you are teaching influences _how_ you apply those rules – and when you might need to break them. As a result, this strand covers multiple ideas around curriculum, planning and assessment. In the classroom, these ideas will lead to practices that all blend into each other.\n\nHowever, to help you develop a clear understanding, this strand begins with modules focused on curriculum and planning, before shifting to looking at assessment:\n\n- **Module 1** explores the foundations of effective subject/phase teaching.\n- **Modules 2-6** cover the process of effective planning in your subject/phase.\n- **Modules 7-12** cover the process of effective assessment and how this can further enhance subject/phase teaching.\n\n### Making it work\n\nThis strand will support you to think deeply about your subject and will support you to zoom in on how the nuances of your subject or phase influence your planning and assessment. As with _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_, we also recognise that there may be aspects of this strand that you have less control over. This might include planning proformas or the frequency of your assessments. To make the most of this strand, we suggest that you use resources and materials aligned with your school curriculum and draw on your mentor and other experienced colleagues to support you in applying and adapting ideas for your classroom. Your growing expertise in your subject will also be of help.\n\nAs usual, we intentionally touch on content you’ve learned before. In particular, we will continue to prompt you to retrieve and apply your understanding of how pupils learn because it is so fundamental to effective teaching. Knowing how pupils learn is invaluable but it does not mean a ‘one size fits all’ approach will work across every subject or phase. The knowledge, skills and conceptual understanding in each subject or phase is unique. All subjects have their own way of structuring knowledge and curriculum planning differs by age.\n\nWhile the Early Career Framework refers to ‘good subject and curriculum knowledge’, we know that some teachers – especially Primary and Early Years teachers – may refer to the content they teach as ‘phase’ or ‘topic’ knowledge, as the curriculum they teach includes multiple subjects. In line with the ECF, this strand uses the title ‘subject’ to encapsulate all of the content teachers might teach and recognises teachers might use other terms in their setting.\n\nWhilst the _Subject_ strand has attempted to explore ideas and practices in ways that will be relevant to all subjects and phases, there will undoubtedly be specific things that just don’t apply. For this strand more than the others, teachers and mentors will need to draw on their own subject and phase expertise to adapt the learning experience where required. You have the responsibility to take ownership of your professional development and make it work, but also the right to support. Talking to your colleagues and your mentor about the ideas and practices you encounter, seeking their assistance, challenge, feedback and critique, will help you to better understand what ‘good’ looks like for your particular context. Participating in wider networks can also strengthen your pedagogical and subject knowledge.\n\n### A reminder of the programme pattern\n\nThe learning will be structured in the same way as _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_, following a weekly rhythm:\n\n- A 10-minute **video** shows what some of the key ECF ideas in the module look like in practice.\n- A 15-minute **evidence summary** provides an overview of key research to read relating to the key ECF ideas in the module.\n- 15 minutes of **quiz** and **reflection** enable you to check your understanding and consider the evidence in light of your knowledge and experiences.\n- Weekly** instructional coaching** that draws on this material and tailors the weekly focus to your specific context and needs, including the needs of your pupils, with built-in opportunities for practice. This is the main part of the mentoring process.\n\nYear one of the programme has been designed with the intention of schools working through one module per week. However, the programme has been built in a flexible way so that schools can adapt it to their needs and work through it at a slower pace as required, while still ensuring they cover the ECF. Now that we have introduced how the strand will work, it’s time to dive into an evidence summary, exploring some of some of the key ideas that underpin the strand.\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Mohamed is feeling increasingly effective at managing behaviour and adapting lessons planned by others. In doing so, his subject knowledge has been growing. How can he best use his developing knowledge to plan and deliver effective lessons which develop pupils’ mental models?\n\n## Key idea\n\nUnderstanding curriculum, planning and assessment, as well as the relationships between them, is an important foundation for effective subject teaching which develops pupil mental models.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The power of subject teaching\n\nMr Mohamed’s teaching can make a big difference to pupils. It can transform both their academic results and life chances: increasing the likelihood that they attend university and have a higher salary and decreasing the chances they have children as teenagers (Chetty et al., 2014; Slater et al., 2011). Lower-achieving pupils appear to benefit most from effective teaching (Slater et al., 2011).\n\nThe expectations a teacher sets are likely to influence pupils’ efforts and responses (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). Where effective teaching helps pupils achieve success, pupils are likely to display greater subsequent motivation and thus greater effort (Coe et al., 2014). There is strong evidence that effective teaching is underpinned by teacher’s knowledge of their subject(s) and how to teach it (Coe et al., 2014; Ball et al., 2008). To make a difference to his pupils Mr Mohamed needs to develop his subject knowledge.\n\nSubject knowledge is organised in mental models in the mind of the learner – a collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which fit together to provide an overall understanding of an idea (Sweller et al., 1998). Mr Mohamed needs to both develop _his_ mental model of his subject and consider how to best organise and use this information to develop his pupils’ mental models. For example, he can consider that a common misconception in history is that a church is a physical building rather than a group of people and target this misconception to ensure his pupils gain a correct mental model when he teaches this.\n\n### What is curriculum?\n\nA school’s curriculum sets out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that pupils will learn. There are many reasons for educating young people, and these inform which curriculum content is selected (Wiliam, 2013). Selection should also be guided by the National Curriculum. The overall aim should be that material is selected based on a coherent vision for pupils’ success. This is curriculum _intent_: the content selected to be taught and the sequence in which it should be explored, including how content builds in complexity or is revisited (Wiliam, 2013).\n\nThe school establishes the curriculum, but every teacher must also think about curriculum because they are the people who are ultimately putting it into practice. Mr Mohamed might not be writing schemes of work but he can bring content to life for his pupils. This is curriculum _implementation_: the instructional approaches, activities and resources specified to teach curricular intent. Implementation is therefore seen in both medium-term planning, individual lesson planning and the ‘lived’ curriculum of the classroom (Wiliam, 2013).\n\nMr Mohamed aims to use his subject mental model to implement the curriculum in such a way that it develops pupils’ mental models of his subject and pursues the intended curriculum as closely as possible. This incorporates both the knowledge that he hopes pupils will gain, and the ways he hopes they will be able to use this knowledge. In doing so, understanding the school’s vision and the reasoning behind its curricular choices will be useful.\n\n### What is planning?\n\nPlanning takes the ideas of the intended curriculum and turns them into learning activities. It must therefore implement the curriculum choices the school has made, drawing on Mr Mohamed’s subject knowledge. One way Mr Mohamed might effectively plan is by following five habits:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Habit 1: Break down your goal** into the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject by analysing your assessment and wider curriculum goals for the unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| **Habit 2: Build on prior knowledge** by linking what pupils already know to what is being taught and sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **Habit 3: Make the learning accessible** by seeking to understand pupils’ differences including potential barriers to learning and common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **Habit 4: Build lasting learning** by planning for regular retrieval and spaced practice opportunities to build automatic recall of knowledge and supporting pupils to learn key ideas securely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Habit 5: Increase complexity** by providing opportunities for all pupils to learn and master essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject, ensuring pupils link new ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models through drawing explicit links between the new content and core concepts and principles and slowly withdrawing concrete examples and drawing attention to the underlying structures of the problem. |\n\nMr Mohamed notices quite a lot of overlap between the habits of planning and content covered in the _Behaviour_ and _Instruction_ strands. There also don’t appear to be clear-cut answers for how to implement these habits in his subject planning. He intends to discuss with his mentor what these might look like for his context, and how he can try these out of the next term.\n\n### What is assessment?\n\nTo assess is to draw conclusions from evidence: inferences about what pupils have learned (Wiliam, 2010). Mr Mohamed might ask himself how much his pupils have understood in an activity, at the end of a lesson or at the end of the year. Effective assessment practices allow him to make inferences which truly reflect pupils’ understanding. Effective assessment builds on a well-specified curriculum so Mr Mohamed’s efforts at planning will support his assessment to be more effective and efficient.\n\nMaking these inferences can be difficult. Mr Mohamed must be careful that the inference he is making reflects what he really wants to know and that he is not distracted by poor proxies for learning (Coe, 2013). For example, not assuming that just because pupils are busy that they are learning. It also means recognising that pupils may perform better in the short term but then forget what they studied (Soderstrom & Bjork, 2015). To help, he should choose, where possible, externally validated materials – such as standardised test created by external bodies or groups of schools and administered in controlled conditions, perhaps at the end of the year – if he needs to make a summative judgement about how much his pupils have learned over a period of time with greater confidence.\n\n### Assessment and feedback\n\nEffective assessment can also be used much more frequently to allow Mr Mohamed to adapt his teaching and respond to pupils’ needs. This form of assessment is the main focus of the _Subject_ strand. Teachers can regularly collect information on pupil learning in a lesson, for example through questioning a number of pupils to check for understanding after conveying new content. They can use their inferences from this data formatively to adapt their teaching and respond to pupils’ needs where necessary (Christodoulou, 2017). Evidence suggests that among the most powerful ways to respond to pupil needs is to offer feedback. Effective feedback is motivating, guiding pupils on where they have succeeded and what they need to improve (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). It also leads pupils to act to close the gap (Sadler, 1989).\n\nThere are many ways to give effective feedback and Mr Mohamed’s choices should reflect what his pupils need and the importance of taking a sustainable approach. For example, he might offer verbal feedback or give abbreviated feedback using a marking code (EEF, 2016). These approaches are quick to do while giving pupils valuable information, encourage pupil effort and improve their learning. Mr Mohamed can work with colleagues to think about how he could ensure his assessment and feedback are efficient. He hopes to use it to support his pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning (EEF, 2017), helping them to become successful independent learners.\n\n### Linking curriculum, planning and assessment\n\nFor assessment, planning and curriculum to be effective, they must be coherent. For example, teaching resources should align with assessments – the tests pupils sit should reflect what they have been taught – and both should align with the curriculum (Oates, 2011). Equally, Mr Mohamed should avoid letting summative assessments – like SATs and GCSEs – shape all his planning. Instead he should aim to use the knowledge of his subject to teach and assess a coherent, broad and balanced curriculum.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nNo exam can test everything that matters in a subject. Exams ‘sample’ from the subject: they choose a handful of questions to test key ideas. This is an effective and efficient way to assess but if this guides all of a teacher’s planning, they are likely to overlook basic ideas (which are implicit in exam questions), broader ideas (which lay the foundations for future study) and interesting ideas (Christodoulou, 2017). Mr Mohamed must avoid the trap of letting assessment narrow his teaching.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nTeachers can be responsive subject teachers by understanding that:\n<ul>\n  <li>Effective teaching develops pupils’ mental models of the subject.</li>\n  <li>\n    Effective planning is based on the school curriculum and the teacher’s\n    subject knowledge: this allows teachers to sequence and plan teaching\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Effective planning uses and builds upon effective assessment: the\n    information this provides guides teachers’ planning and allows them to\n    target support through responsive\n  </li>\n  <li>Effective planning and assessment can be sustainable.</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBall, D.

The better teachers know what they're\nteaching before they step into the classroom, the more effective they can be. But\nidentifying what to teach can feel daunting. So where should teachers start? A good\napproach to planning is to start at the end. Teachers need to identify ambitious\nlearning goals for their pupils, and understand what they're made up of. Planning\nbackwards from ambitious learning goals can lead to success in school and beyond.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nTeachers need to deliver a rich and carefully sequenced curriculum. In order to deliver\na curriculum well, teachers need a detailed understanding of it. This will include\na solid understanding of what the topic is, the best order in which to teach it and\nwhere pupils are likely to go wrong. Planning backwards is a technique that can help\nteachers to develop this knowledge. In particular, planning backwards helps teachers\nto know what they are teaching in depth.\n\nPlanning backwards begins with:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Identifying learning goals and</li>\n  <li>Unpicking learning goals to see what they are made up of.</li>\n</ol>\nThere are several strategies that teachers can use to identify learning goals. Firstly,\nthe unit of work that they're teaching will often set out the most important content.\nSo highlighting learning goals in a unit of work is a good place to start. Most school\ncurricula are influenced by the national curriculum. Reading the relevant section\nof the national curriculum is another way to identify learning goals. Some units\nof work will include an end of unit assessment. Whilst this will not assess everything\nthat the unit of work covers, it should assess a sample of the most important content.\nCompleting the end of unit task can help teachers to identify learning goals because\nit gives them a concrete example of what success may look like at the end of the\nunit. Finally, teachers can draw on their own subject knowledge to identify learning\ngoals for pupils. They can ask themselves, what do I know about this content? Or,\nwhat does a good example of this content look like?\n\nThe next key step in planning backwards is to unpick what the learning goals consist of. Learning goals needs to be broken down into specific content to make them more manageable for pupils. To do this, answering these two questions can help. What knowledge sits within this goal? What skills are required to achieve this goal? Unpicking learning goals gives teachers the detailed understanding that they need to teach. It's best to do this thinking with someone else. It takes time to identify learning goals and unpick what they consist of. Also, things that appear easy to do can often be tricky to teach. A teacher may be brilliant at writing a persuasive essay but not be able to identify what makes it so good, at least not yet. We all know how to tell the time from an analogue clock but working out what knowledge this draws on and why pupils often go wrong is really hard. Instead of doing this on your own, work with someone who knows the subject, and knows how to teach it.\n\nOnce teachers have identified learning goals and unpicked them, they can use this knowledge to make decisions about what content to prioritize, the best order in which to teach it and the best way to share it. Teachers need to break learning goals down so that they can piece this content back together in a way that will make sense for their pupils.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you're going to watch part of a coaching session with an early\ncareer teacher. The aim of the coaching session is to identify the learning goals\nof the following year three topic: rainforests. As you watch pay particular attention\nto how the coach and the teacher do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify the essential concepts, knowledge and skills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>\n<em>\n  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So by the end of this unit on rain orests, what do\n  we want our pupils to know and be able to do?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT (PAULA DELANEY): Here is the list of knowledge that I identified from\n  looking at the scheme of work.\n</em>\n\n<em>KNOWLEDGE</em>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <em>To know what rainforests are</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>To know what an ecosystem is</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know what the equator is and that it is warmer because it is closer to\n      the sun{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>To know that a continent is a mass of land </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that South America is a continent and that it is surrounded by the\n      Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>To know what deforestation is and what impact it has</em>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<em>\n  COACH: Great, this is all important content specifically mentioned in the\n  scheme of work. Let's see if we can break it down further. So it'd be good to\n  do this with some of the items on your list of knowledge. So we can be more\n  specific. If you're more specific in your thinking now, you'll save a lot of\n  time later when you use this content in your lessons. For example, instead of\n  \"to know what rain forests are\", it would be better to say \"to know that rain\n  forests are ecosystems filled with mostly evergreen trees, and typically\n  receive high amounts of rainfall.\" And then go further and say that\n  rainforests are made up of a canopy layer, the understory and the forest\n  floor. You need to change those 'know what' statements to 'know that'\n  statements. So as part of my planning for the unit, I did some of this\n  thinking, by completing the end of unit assessment and coming up with a list\n  of knowledge and skills, which I think it'd be really helpful for you to see.\n  Let's have a look:\n</em>\n\n<em>KNOWLEDGE</em>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that a continent is an area of the world that contains different\n      countries.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that there are seven different continents: Africa, Antartica,\n      Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that rainforests lie between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic\n      of Capricorn (invisible lines).\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that rainforests are found near the equator with high average\n      temperatures and humidity{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that around two-thirds of the world’s species live in rainforests.\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that rainforests are home to thousands of different animal\n      species.\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that birds mainly live in the emergent layer of rainforests.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>To know that larger mammals live on the forest floor. </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that some arboreal mammals live in trees, like monkeys and sloths.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that deforestation is when a wide area of trees is cleared for\n      non-forest use.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that it is estimated that an area of rainforest the size of a\n      football pitch is cut down every single second.{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that rainforests play an important role in absorbing carbon\n      dioxide and producing oxygen.\n    </em>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<em>SKILLS</em>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <em>To be able to use compass points to locate a place on a map.</em>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<em>\n  COACH: Are any of these statements ones we think pupils will already have?\n  Let's put a star next to the ones where we think pupils will have relevant\n  prior knowledge.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: So to know that a continent is an area of the world that contains\n  different countries, to know that there are seven different continents, and to\n  be able to use compass points to locate a place in the map.\n</em>\n\n<em>COACH: How do we know that pupils will know what a continent is?</em>\n\n<em>\n   ECT: Well, I know what pupils were told what a continent is in year two in\n  the topic our amazing world, and I've looked at some of my class assessments\n  from this topic, and majority include the correct definition of continent.\n  I'll also make sure that I recall this knowledge at the start of the unit, and\n  at key points throughout to make sure that it's really secure.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n   COACH: Great. Let's think now about the key misconceptions. So where do you\n  think pupils might typically go wrong?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n   ECT: I think that they might get confused about why it rains in a hot place.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Yes, that's definitely a misconception. They associate heat with the\n  sun not the rain. We'll need to correct it because it will get in the way of\n  them understanding about rainforests, and the process of precipitation, which\n  they learn next year when they study the water cycle. Another misconception\n  that pupils hold is thinking that trees in the rainforest are a similar height\n  to tall trees that they have come across, like an oak tree. They find it\n  really hard to understand the difference in scale, but again, this needs\n  correcting. If it isn't they'll find it hard to understand why such a large\n  range of animals can live in the rainforests together. They wonder why jaguars\n  roam around the forest floor and don't eat monkeys who live in the canopy.\n  They won't understand that they're such a huge distance apart. We've done some\n  really detailed thinking here. You'll be able to use this when you're\n  preparing individual lessons and when you're delivering the lessons\n  themselves. The next step is to think about how we sequence this content, what\n  pupils will need to know at the beginning so that they can build on it\n  throughout the unit.\n</em>\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nIn this example, the coach and the early career teacher focused primarily on\nidentifying the essential concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils need to\nlearn about rainforests. They drew on a range of sources to identify this\ncontent: the school's units of work, a completed end of unit task and their own\nsubject knowledge. They broke big statements into detail, changing big 'know\nwhat' statements into smaller 'know that' statements. And then they considered\ntheir list from the pupils' point of view, asking themselves which of the\ncontent pupils already knew, and what common misconceptions they would be likely\nto hold.\n\nThey didn't think about the best order to teach it in yet. Just like identifying the learning content of the lesson in detail before you plot out the activities, it is really important to identify the learning content of a unit of work, before you decide the order in which to teach it. That comes next.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored why it is important to plan backwards from end goals\nand given some practical strategies that you can use during your own planning. Before\nwe finish, take a moment to read over the key ideas. Which of these ideas do you\nthink that the example illustrates the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identify possible misconceptions and plan how to prevent these forming\n  </li>\n  <li>Be aware of common misconceptions</li>\n  <li>\n    Discuss with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important\n    concepts\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nGetting to know your curriculum and what you want pupils to learn takes time,\nand it's an ongoing process. But this is an essential part of what teachers do.\nThe better that teachers understand the learning goals of their unit, the more\nlikely they will be to ensure that pupils achieve them. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S2.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Andrews is increasingly confident in managing behaviour and motivating students to participate in lessons. This gives her more time to think about lessons. She wants to ensure she is making the best use of the limited time she has with pupils: how can her planning best ensure pupils learn?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffective teaching is planned backwards, breaking down and communicating ambitious learning goals set out in the curriculum.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### **Basing learning on the curriculum**\n\nMs Andrews’ planning begins with the curriculum. The curriculum sets out the learning to which all pupils are entitled (Wiliam, 2016). It determines the ideas pupils should encounter and the knowledge and skills they should acquire (Wiliam, 2018). This guides teachers to teach the most important knowledge, skills and values effectively. For example, a carefully designed maths curriculum (alongside effective teaching methods) appears to increase pupil learning (Jerrim & Vignoles, 2016).\n\nMost schools base their curriculum on the national curriculum, with adaptations to suit pupils’ needs and the school’s vision. Individual teachers are not responsible for setting the curriculum: what they do, which no curriculum designer can do, is make the curriculum comprehensible. They do this by connecting what pupils are to learn with their existing knowledge and experience (Young et al, 2014). Ms Andrews’ success relies on secure knowledge of the curriculum and her pupils in order to motivate and teach them effectively.\n\n### What teachers need to know about what they teach\n\nA challenge intrinsic to teaching is making complicated ideas in the curriculum comprehensible to pupils (Kennedy, 2015). In doing this, Ms Andrews must balance making ideas simple enough to understand, whilst remaining meaningful, and true to the curriculum. Ms Andrews’ skill in doing this rests on her developing understanding of the knowledge, skills and values she teaches. As well as being guided by the school curriculum, she can use colleagues and shared resources to build this knowledge. When she does so, to translate curriculum goals into effective learning experiences, Ms Andrews needs to know:\n\n- **The topic:** What a non-specialist, but well-informed adult might know about it.\n- **Ways to introduce and sequence ideas:** In what order to introduce key ideas, and how best to explain them.\n- **Where pupils will struggle and what they might get wrong:** Allowing her to anticipate and overcome pupils’ misunderstandings.\n- **Potential links:** How the current topic connects to past and future topics (Ball, Thames & Phelps, 2008).\n\nMs Andrews needs more than a knowledge of the topic: she needs to know how students learn it and how to make it comprehensible to them.\n\n### Breaking learning down\n\nThis knowledge — of curricular goals and how pupils learn them – allows Ms Andrews to plan lessons which work towards her goals in logical, carefully-pitched steps. Ms Andrews is aware of the need to break complicated ideas down to make them comprehensible: she designs tasks so that they do not provide too much new or complicated information at once.\n\nHowever, she recognises a broader point about breaking learning down when she plans lessons which work towards learning goals. Rather than designing isolated tasks and fitting them into a lesson, she seeks to link tasks to form a sequence of meaningful steps towards learning goals across multiple lessons. To succeed she needs to make explicit links to what has been previously studied and learned as she goes. For example, when she introduces a new idea with concrete examples and highlights the underlying principles and offers practice, each activity is a step towards achieving the learning goal, building on previous study.\n\nThis approach allows her to organise her lessons around a narrative structure of steps towards understanding and achieving a learning goal: this approach is both more comprehensible and more memorable for pupils (Willingham, 2009, pp.66-9).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhile schools establish what they will teach informed by the National Curriculum, teachers are always doing curricular thinking, as they find new and better ways to teach the school’s curriculum. Their thinking then informs future revisions of the curriculum. Gaining this knowledge of how pupils learn a subject takes time. A new teacher would not be expected to achieve this depth immediately: the usefulness of these categories is in knowing what to think about in planning, and what to ask colleagues. High-quality curricular resources may also embody these forms of knowledge, for example textbooks or colleagues’ shared resources aligned to the school curriculum.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Andrews can begin to make a difference to pupils by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Planning backwards from specific, ambitious goals for knowledge, skills and\n    values: the learning goals set out in the curriculum.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using her knowledge of the subject and topic and how pupils learn it to\n    break big goals into smaller, more manageable ones and to sequence these\n    goals.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Organising the lesson into a sequence of meaningful steps towards her\n    learning.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nCoe, R., Aloisi, C., Higgins, S., & Major, L.

But it can often feel like there is a large amount of content to\ncover. Teachers need to identify the different types of knowledge that a lesson includes,\nand know why they are there. How do different bits help to develop pupil understanding?\nIdentifying different types of knowledge helps teachers to understand the best routes\nthrough the content and what areas they might prioritise.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nWhen you look at a lesson, there is often a daunting amount of content to teach.\nIt would be overwhelming to present pupils with a mass of content, but we can't simply\ncut out all the detail either. Instead teachers need to create a meaningful pathway\nthat guides pupils towards clear learning goals. Put another way, we want to help\npupils to construct coherent mental models from the content that we teach them.\n\nA mental model is what we know about something. It is a structured body of knowledge and skills that helps us to make sense of things. We use mental models to understand and navigate the world around us. When we enter a restaurant, our mental model of what a restaurant is and what people do within a restaurant guides our actions. Our mental model of a restaurant is likely to include the fact that there will be menus to choose from. So we might look for a menu when we sit down. When we read a text that mentions the word dinosaur, we draw on our mental model of what a dinosaur is to make meaning from the words. We know that dinosaurs are extinct and could be ferocious, and this will help us to make sense of the text. The more we know about the world and the better that knowledge is secured and organised, the more we can know and do. We want to help pupils to build mental models and retain them in the long term. Examining your own mental model of the content, what you know about it, will help with this process.\n\nTo identify the different types of knowledge within a lesson and the role that they play in forming pupils' mental models, it can be helpful to do a sorting exercise, in which teachers identify the most important content that they want pupils to remember, and the additional content that will be necessary for this. They can identify the critical content and supporting materials such as the best examples, analogies, stories, and details to frame it and make it stick.\n\nCritical content is what you hope your pupils will remember in one year, three years or even more. The concept of solitude, the concept of evaporation. Supporting material enables pupils to access this critical content. But we may be willing to accept pupils forgetting some of it. Individual examples of solitude, that the puddles dried up in the playground before children had a chance to jump in them. Supporting material includes analogies, stories, and illustrations. There are different ways of presenting material and teachers need to think carefully about this choice. Examples give your understanding substance. Critical content will sit at the heart of our pupils' mental models, and lots of other content will relate to it. We want our pupils to keep hold of it, and apply it in the future.\n\nBoth critical and supporting content are important. Supporting material may provide the concrete examples that make sense of an abstract concept to recall the prior knowledge that will help pupils to understand and remember something new. Supporting material can provide pupils with the rich breadth of knowledge that the broad and balanced curriculum should offer, and increased complexity. For example, when teaching the First and Second World Wars, including the contribution of BAME soldiers helps to expand pupils' understanding of the personal sacrifices made. Supporting materials might also bring the lessons to life and help pupils to pay attention. For example, a geography teacher may want pupils to understand the concept of biome. To do that they might teach pupils about some of the different plants and animals that live in a particular biome, perhaps the Amazon rainforest. Over time pupils are likely to remember the meaning of biome, but forget some of the details specific to the Amazon rainforest. That pupils retain the understanding of biome is important but that doesn't make the details redundant.\n\nWhen teachers have a good understanding of the critical content and supporting material in a lesson, and how they are connected, they can sequence learning in a coherent way. They can identify prior knowledge that links to the critical material, and ensure that the lesson builds on that. They will know when to introduce supporting material and when to move on from it, and which content they will need to revisit in order to strengthen it. They can take their pupils on a better learning journey.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next model, you will hear part of a coaching conversation. The focus of the\nconversation is to identify the different types of knowledge that one particular\nlesson covers, and the order in which they should come. As you watch pay particular\nattention to how they do the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identify essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Sequence lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before\n    encountering more complex content\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>\n<em>\n  COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): So our goal for this coaching session is to\n  understand what content you're teaching in the lesson, and why that each piece\n  of content is there. So we want to know the most critical content and what the\n  role of the supporting material is playing in their learning. Remind me what\n  the scheme of work is? What is the overall learning goal of the lesson? And\n  how is the lesson connected to the goal in the scheme of work?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n   ECT (PAULA DELANEY): So this is a year 3 scheme of work about the\n  rainforests. And the learning goal for this lesson is to understand some of\n  the differences between their lives and the lives of tribal families. And so\n  far pupils have a good understanding of what a rainforest is and the vast\n  amount of species and plants that the rainforest supports. But in this lesson,\n  they will be learning more about the people that the rainforest supports.\n  Later on pupils will learn what deforestation is. So a key goal of this scheme\n  of work is understanding the detrimental effect of deforestation. In this\n  lesson, pupils need to acquire an understanding of how vital the rainforest is\n  to the people that live there, so they can recognise how bad deforestation is\n  for the people that rely on it.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Great. I know that you've looked at the suggested lesson resources to\n  identify what pupils are learning. Can you show me the list of knowledge and\n  skills that you've identified?\n</em>\n\n<em> ECT: Yep, here's the list.</em>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that most children in the UK tend to live with their parents{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that in the Amazon rainforest children live with their extended\n      family in tribes{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that children in the UK have free access to healthcare via the NHS\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that tribal families in the Amazon rainforest have limited access\n      to healthcare clinics or hospitals but instead rely on local plants and\n      remedies{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that many of the medicines we use in the UK come from plants which\n      grow in the Amazon rainforest{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that children in the UK must now be in education or training until\n      at least the age of 16. In England the age is 18{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that education in the Amazon rainforest can take many different\n      forms as communities can be quite small and remote: some pupils may have\n      lessons which are delivered remotely while others attend small schools\n      where there are pupils of different ages taught by the same teacher{\" \"}\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that in the UK much of the food we eat is bought from shops and\n      supermarkets\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>\n      To know that in the Amazon rainforest communities tend to work together to\n      grow and produce their own food locally or hunt for it using tools they\n      have developed specifically for this purpose\n    </em>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<em>\n  COACH: Great. So now I want you to think about which of the content you would\n  describe as critical. So by critical, I mean, it's the content that you want\n  your pupils to remember in the long term. Perhaps because there's lots of\n  other ideas that relate to it, or because it's critical to their understanding\n  of other concepts in the scheme of work like deforestation or sustainability.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Okay. Sure. I think that this is the content that I would describe as\n  critical.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Let's apply a couple of questions to these statements, to test out\n  whether they really are critical content. Let's take this statement first. Why\n  is it important that pupils know and remember this?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: So food is locally sourced by Amazon rainforest communities from the\n  forest and river around them. They have developed a specific tools and\n  practices for hunting local game, and children learn about different plants\n  that are edible as part of their education. So if our pupils know this it will\n  help them to recognise that one of the reasons why deforestation is so\n  devastating because it deprives communities in the Amazon rainforest of that\n  vital food source.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Great. Is there any material that you think is supporting? So by\n  supporting, I mean it helps to understand this core content but we might not\n  require pupils to remember it in the long term.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Yeah, remembering the specific types of food that people in the Amazon\n  rainforest eat.\n</em>\n\n<em>COACH: </em>\n<em>Okay. So why is this material in the lesson?</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: So introducing them to different food types gives them a concrete\n  example, which will help them to see how much communities in the Amazon rely\n  on local food production. I wouldn't expect them to remember the precise foods\n  consumed in the Amazon, but I do want them to remember it, that they are\n  reliant on local foods.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: I agree. And looking back at your original list, I would suggest that\n  the following content could also be described as supporting material. It\n  serves that important purpose in the lesson, but we're willing to accept that\n  pupils may forget some of it. Let's have a look. So knowing what school is\n  like for children in the Amazon rainforest will be really interesting to our\n  pupils. And it's another example of something concrete that will help them\n  relate to children in the Amazon, but it's okay if pupils lose this detail,\n  once it's served its purpose in the lesson. In terms of sequencing, which\n  items on your list do you think it makes sense to start with first?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: I think it would be good to start by looking at the different food\n  sources in the rainforest. This gives pupils an opportunity to recall what\n  they know about the different plant and animal species in there. This is\n  something we explored in previous lessons. It also helps them to visualize\n  what rainforest are like. And they will need to do this before they can think\n  about the lives of the people who live in the rainforests.\n</em>\n\n<em>COACH: What would pupils need to learn next?</em>\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nThere were a couple of key ideas to highlight from this conversation. First,\nboth the coach and the early career teacher were clear about what they wanted\ntheir pupils to remember from the lesson. From a longer list of knowledge, they\nidentified the critical content. Once they had identified what knowledge pupils\nneeded to learn, they discussed how to sequence it. They identified which\nknowledge pupils needed to secure first. In this case, knowledge of the\ndifferent plants and animal species found in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThis is only a snapshot of a longer coaching conversation, so it cannot show the full detail of everything discussed. However, even from this short example, it is clear that the early career teacher was thinking deeply about what pupils were learning in the lesson, what purpose each piece of content served and the best order in which to teach it. This will enable the early career teacher to plot a clear path through the large amount of content, ensuring that the pupils secure and revisit the big ideas of a subject over time.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored how to identify different types of knowledge in a\nlesson, and how to sequence them. Before we finish, read over the key ideas that\nwe have covered. Which ones do you feel that the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the\n    subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these\n    critical components.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before\n    encountering more complex content.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts\n    through a range of examples.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nThinking hard about what you are teaching is a vital part of a teacher's role.\nExamining different types of knowledge in a lesson and how it is connected helps\nteachers to know what they're teaching and why. They can then use this knowledge\nto make decisions in the classroom that can help motivate pupils in their\nlearning and develop sophisticated mental models of their subject. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S3.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones has reviewed the curriculum for his next topic: he is confident about the learning goals, has refreshed his knowledge of the key ideas and has talked to colleagues about how pupils can best learn them. However, the amount and range of content appears huge. He is unsure how he will find time to cover everything in depth. What should he prioritise teaching?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can develop pupils’ mental models by identifying and ensuring they understand and retain critical subject content.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Mental models\n\nMr Jones is using guidance from the school curriculum, colleagues and curricular resources to build up an increasingly sophisticated mental model of the subject. A mental model is a structured body of knowledge. It is a collection of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles which fit together to provide an overall understanding of an idea (Sweller et al., 1998). For example, most adults have a mental model of a restaurant: this means they know what to do (more-or-less) in a new restaurant or an unfamiliar country (Sweller et al., 1998). Similarly, Mr Jones has a mental model of the topics he is teaching: both the content that he is going to teach about and how to teach it in a way that links to a subject – what makes this content historical or mathematical? He knows the key ideas, the underlying principles and how they fit together. For example, he knows the key events of the English Civil War, how they are linked and different ways in which they can be interpreted.\n\nTo achieve curricular goals, he must use his subject mental model to motivate pupils to develop increasingly complex mental models of the subject. The more complex a pupil’s mental model, the better they can apply it to skills such as answering questions, solving problems or learning new ideas (Willingham, 2009). For example, a pupil whose mental model did not include the word “monarch” or the concept of “Parliament” would struggle to make sense of a text describing the causes of the Civil War. In contrast, a pupil with a complex mental model would move from attempting to understand the story of the Civil War to using historical reasoning as to which cause was most significant.\n\n### The importance of knowledge\n\nWhen pupils learn, they gain – and retain – deeper and more sophisticated knowledge in their mental models. Developing pupil knowledge is important as the more pupils know (and the better organised their knowledge), the better they can understand a new idea (by connecting it to their existing knowledge) and the better they can solve problems (by applying their knowledge). Their existing knowledge reduces the burden on pupils’ working memory (Deans for Impact, 2015; Willingham, 2006).\n\nTherefore, if Mr Jones is to help pupils achieve ambitious learning goals, his priority is teaching pupils knowledge in order to also develop their skills (Willingham 2009). He should focus on what he wants his pupils to know and be able to do. For example, a wide vocabulary will help pupils understand unfamiliar texts, while knowledge of long multiplication gives pupils the capability to solve previously unseen maths problems.\n\nTo develop pupils’ mental models, Mr Jones must first identify their constituent parts: exactly what he wants pupils to know. This helps him to reduce his sophisticated knowledge into comprehensible building blocks for pupils: doing so reduces the risk of overestimating pupils’ knowledge and underestimating how hard they will find new ideas (Wiliam, 2013). If he wants pupils to explain the causes of the Civil War, he can identify what he wants them to know about each cause, for example: “to know that King Charles I believed he ruled by Divine Right.” If he wants pupils to complete long multiplication, he can identify that he wants them to know that a number can be partitioned into tens and hundreds.\n\n### Prioritising subject content\n\nHaving identified everything he wants pupils to know about a topic, Mr Jones is left with a problem: there is a huge amount of relevant and interesting knowledge. He can address this by identifying the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – the ‘critical’ subject content that pupils need to remember in order to have a complete mental model (Counsell, 2018; Sweller et al., 1998). Critical content is what he hopes pupils will recall in one, three, or perhaps even ten years: Iago’s jealousy, the causes of the English Civil War, and how to design an experiment.\n\nMr Jones could also identify how he wants his pupils to organise what they remember. For example, concepts are organising ideas that allow us to categorise knowledge (Chi, 2009). Critical concepts, then, are important _subject_ ideas Mr Jones will want to return to many times to help pupils develop _organised_ mental models of his subject. Therefore, he can introduce the idea of the _tragic form_ in English literature and teach Othello as an example of this. In science, he could teach the _scientific method_ in biology, chemistry and physics and use experiments as examples of these. This content will also influence how he sequences what he teaches. He can plan how a new idea can be linked to previous and future learning (Wiliam, 2013) by asking: which content is foundational and why? Where relevant, he might also identify subject principles (Chi, 2009). Subject principles are rules or theorems that serve to apply across a whole field. They can be used to transcend specific examples. For example, in physics he might teach the _Law of Conservation of Energy_ or _Newton’s Second Law (F=MA)_ and highlight when these principles are returned to, to help pupils organise their mental models. In an Early Years setting, teachers might return to the principle of synthetic phonics at different times as they teach reading.\n\nThe National Curriculum also calls for a ‘broad and balanced curriculum’. So, in addition to ‘critical’ content, Mr Jones should select ‘supporting’ content: further examples, stories and illustrations that he won’t necessarily expect his pupils to remember, but which will bring his teaching to life and support pupils to remember and understand the critical content. It is particularly effective if these examples explicitly link to pupils’ knowledge and experiences. This supporting content helps pupils make sense of critical content: Othello wouldn’t make sense without all its characters; getting the equipment wrong means an experiment will not work. So, while Mr Jones is teaching these topics, he wants pupils to know, understand and recall supporting content as well as the critical content. However, after teaching the topic, he will accept that he does not need to revisit supporting content (since not every item of information can be recalled and his time is limited); but he will want to ensure critical content is revisited to strengthen it.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nDeveloping pupils’ knowledge does not just mean teaching isolated facts: mental models are organised collections of concepts, knowledge, skills and principles.\n\nWhile it is important that supporting content brings critical content to life and makes it meaningful, teachers need to be careful that it does not distract from pupils remembering critical content.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can help students to develop their mental models and think more effectively\nabout his subject by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Focusing on developing pupil knowledge in order to ultimately develop pupil\n    capabilities and understanding.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Developing his mental model using available resources and reflecting on what\n    this implies in terms of the important knowledge he wants to teach.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Prioritising types of knowledge and identifying which is <em>critical </em>\n    subject content – concepts, knowledge, skills and principles – that he wants\n    pupils to retain, while teaching enough supporting content to give pupils\n    access to a broad and balanced curriculum.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nDeans for Impact (2015). _The Science of Learning._ [bit.ly/ecf-dea](http://bit.ly/ecf-dea)\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nChi, M.

They connect new content to existing knowledge that they hold. Whilst\nit would be great to think that they will only add accurate information to their\nmental models, the reality is somewhat different. Along the way pupils are likely\nto pick up lots of misconceptions. Gaps may also appear in pupils' mental models.\nTeachers need to identify the gaps and misconceptions that pupils may hold so that\nthey can help their pupils to correct them.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nMisconceptions are beliefs which conflict with what is to be learned. This differs\nfrom lack of knowledge, where pupils have gaps in their understanding about a topic.\nMisconceptions also differ from mistakes. An example of a mistake might be spelling\na word wrong. The pupil knows how to spell the word correctly but has forgotten in\nthat moment. It's just an oversight. A misconception on the other hand can often\nbe deeply rooted.\n\nMisconceptions exist in every subject and phase. In early years, pupils might think that when leaves fall off the trees in autumn, the trees are dying, or in science pupils often think that when liquids evaporate they have disappeared. Misconceptions like this can cause a significant barrier to pupils' learning so we need to do something about them.\n\nHere's one approach that teachers can take to misconceptions. First, identify what misconceptions pupils may hold. Next, plan a series of questions to check if your pupils do hold them or not. Lastly, adapt your teaching to address misconceptions that you find.\n\nWhen identifying misconceptions it's best to focus first on the most significant misconceptions that many pupils hold. Individual pupils will hold lots of specific misconceptions depending on their prior knowledge. But to make this process manageable for teachers it is good to prioritise the most important misconceptions that will create a barrier to learning.\n\nAnother thing to bear in mind is that anticipating misconceptions can be hard to do so it's important to draw on the experience of subjects and phase colleagues, which may help. If teachers think about the misconceptions that their pupils are likely to hold about particular content before they teach it to them, then they will be more likely to know what to do when they spot them. They can aim to guide their pupils around misconceptions to prevent them forming part of their mental model.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to identify misconceptions. As you\nlisten, pay particular attention to how the coach does the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Identifies common misconceptions</li>\n  <li>\n    Uses assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing\n    misconceptions\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nThe purpose of this model, imagine that I will be teaching my year seven\ngeography class about plate boundaries and their interactions. I need to make\nsure that pupils have a really firm understanding of plate tectonics. As part of\nmy planning for the lesson, I discuss this with a colleague who had taught the\ntopic before, and she reminded me that this is something that pupils often get\nquite confused about. She highlighted two misconceptions that are particularly\ncommon. Here are the misconceptions.\n<ol>\n  <li>Each continent has its own plate.</li>\n  <li>Continents sit on top of (but apart from) plates.</li>\n</ol>\nIn this instance, a simple true or false question will help. I can get pupils to\nread each statement and tell me if they think it is true or false. This will\ngive me a really quick snapshot of what the whole class believe. If I find out\nthey hold either misconception, I can deliver a pre-prepared response to address\nit there and then.\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nLet's focus on a couple of things in this model. First, the teacher made sure\nthat they thought about potential misconceptions in advance of teaching their\nlesson. They worked with an experienced colleague who made sure that they were\nfocusing on a common misconception that many pupils held.\n\nSecond, the teacher planned a really quick way of assessing to see if pupils held either misconception by asking a direct question. If they said that either statement was true the teacher can be fairly safe to assume that pupils hold this misconception and so they can adapt their teaching.\n\nNotice how they checked for one misconception at a time. It is important to do this so that you can pinpoint the precise misconception that the pupils hold and then address it.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we considered what the term misconception means and how teachers can\nbegin to identify them. Before we finish, take a moment to read through the key ideas\nthat the video has covered. Which of the following ideas do you think that the example\nillustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced\n    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing\n    misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge\n    gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within\n    multiple-choice questions)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nKnowing your pupils' prior knowledge of misconceptions can help you address\nbarriers to learning. With sufficient planning to expose gaps in prior knowledge\nand misconceptions, you can ensure pupils get the support they need. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S4.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Brown is confident about what she wants pupils to learn. However, she is often surprised by the gaps in pupils’ knowledge and the misconceptions they sometimes hold. How can she plan to address gaps and misconceptions so all pupils can access the curriculum?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers should proactively find out about pupil prior knowledge and deliberately address common misconceptions and pupil knowledge gaps.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Gaps in pupil prior knowledge and implications for individual needs\n\nPupils enter the classroom with different prior knowledge. For example, some may have been exposed to a concept intentionally the previous school year, while other teachers did not prioritise the same concept; some may have been introduced to it at home or through personal interest, while others may not. These knowledge gaps have consequences for pupils’ understanding: for example, if they lack important vocabulary, they may not be able to read a text, or may simply misunderstand it (Willingham, 2006). Ms Brown needs to identify who knows what if she is to make new ideas comprehensible by linking them to pupils’ existing knowledge.\n\n### Watching out for misconceptions\n\nMisconceptions are potentially more problematic than knowledge gaps. Misconceptions are distinct from knowledge gaps (where pupils know nothing about a topic) and from errors (for example, a spelling mistake): they are beliefs which conflict with what is to be learned (Chi, 2009). A knowledge gap or an error can be addressed relatively simply but a misconception, whether held by pupils already or developed during a topic, may be harder to address. For example, if pupils believe that an apostrophe should be added whenever they see a plural ‘s’, this is harder for Ms Brown to influence than if a pupil forgot or had never been introduced to the rule.\n\nMost misconceptions are specific to the topic being taught. For example, a common misconception in adding fractions is that pupils should add the numerators and the denominators together. Ms Brown needs to identify common misconceptions: her more-experienced colleagues may have valuable knowledge here. Once Ms Brown has identified likely misconceptions in an upcoming topic, she can check whether pupils have those misconceptions and can seek to overcome them.\n\n### Responding to pupil needs\n\nMs Brown can anticipate and respond to pupils’ knowledge gaps and misconceptions. Once she has identified the knowledge pupils need to understand a new idea, and the potential misconceptions they may hold or develop, she can design checks of pupil understanding to uncover these barriers for this knowledge (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\nWhere she identifies knowledge gaps, she can address them by explicitly teaching anything pupils must know to understand a topic, for example, prerequisite vocabulary, or knowledge which has been introduced in previous years. Where she identifies misconceptions, she can address them by offering analogies which bridge between pupils' existing knowledge and their misconception (Luciarello & Naff, n.d.). For example, if pupils believe objects sink because they are heavy (a misconception which confuses weight with density), she can give the example of a ship – which is obviously heavy, but floats – and use this to help pupils appreciate their misconception.\n\nDeveloping pupils’ subject knowledge also helps all pupils in two ways:\n\n1. By ensuring pupils have increasingly developed and organised mental models upon which they can draw.\n2. By reducing the new information actively being processed in pupils’ limited working memory (Sweller et al., 1988).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhile there is much overlap between what pupils know, each pupil will also have unique areas of prior knowledge (and lack of knowledge), based on individual experiences. Identifying exactly what each pupil knows would be impossible for Ms Brown: it’s more important that she identifies the most important knowledge for a topic and whether all pupils know that than that she identifies everything they do and don’t know (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Brown can better tackle pupil knowledge gaps and misconceptions by understanding\nthat:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    A key reason for differing pupil needs is their different levels of prior\n    knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Pupils may have – or develop – misconceptions: incorrect beliefs about a\n    topic or subject.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Teachers can identify and overcome these incomplete mental models by using\n    knowledge of subject and common misconceptions, for example to generate\n    analogies based on existing knowledge.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### **Further reading**\n\nBall, D.

We want them to\ndevelop complex mental models so that they can use them beyond the classroom, but\nlearning something new takes time. Before we ask pupils to apply what they have learned\nwe need to ensure that they have acquired it securely in the first place. Acquiring\nknowledge takes repeated exposure across a sequence of learning.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nBefore applying knowledge on their own or in different contexts, pupils need to gain\nknowledge in the first place. This takes time and effort. For example, pupils need\nto know the rules for applying speech marks before applying them accurately in story\nwriting or pupils need to know that rainforests support a vast number of different\nplants and animals in order to fully recognize the impact of deforestation. Relevant\nfoundational knowledge needs to be secure before pupils encounter more complex content\nor think critically, but acquiring knowledge takes time and some content will require\nmore time and practice to become secure.\n\nTeachers need to ensure that pupils acquire knowledge before they ask them to apply it. In practice they need to think carefully about how they will teach key knowledge and how they will check that pupils have obtained it.\n\nIn the early stages of learning, teachers need to give pupils plenty of opportunities to acquire knowledge. We also want pupils to retain what they learn. To help pupils both acquire and retain content, we need to identify relevant prior knowledge to build on and provide a careful balance of exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval. During the exposition stage, it is important to build on what pupils already know, and break down learning so that it is manageable. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a subject can be beneficial. Repetition of content should be spaced out over a sequence of learning to ensure that pupils have to think hard about what they are learning. During the practice phase, it can be effective to stick to the same task and context as the exposition. Concrete representations of abstract ideas can help pupils in the early stages of acquiring knowledge. For example, in an earlier setting a teacher might ask pupils to recognise the number of oranges in a bowl in order to practise the abstract concept of subitising, recognising number through visual arrangement. And it is important to come back to the same knowledge again to get pupils to retrieve it from their memory, especially after a little time has passed. The short period of time allows a degree of forgetting to set in, which makes the act of retrieval harder and therefore strengthens retention of knowledge. The psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus illustrated this in a graph known as the Forgetting Curve. After an initial period of practice sometimes called massed practice, spacing practice out to allow some forgetting to occur helps pupils to remember what they learn.\n\nThe next step in the journey from acquisition to application is to check pupil understanding. Before teachers ask pupils to apply their knowledge in a different context, they need to check the acquisition is secure. Of course, teachers will be checking for understanding as they go, but it is still important to carry out a check before setting a task that gets pupils to use this knowledge in a different way.\n\nUltimately, we want pupils to apply what they learn in many different contexts; this enables them to solve problems and to think critically. In order to do this, pupils need to have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they've been asked to think critically about.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of checking for how securely pupils acquired\nsome content. As you watch, pay particular attention to how the coach does the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identifies essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the\n    subject and provides opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these\n    critical components\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Sequences lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before\n    encountering more complex content\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nImagine that I am teaching a year 5 science lesson. The topic is adaptations and\nwe're looking at how plants and animals have adapted to extreme environments.\nNow in the first lesson, I introduced the concept of the food chain, the key\nvocabulary and the flow of energy through that food chain. And at the end of the\nlesson last week, the class showed a good level of understanding. However, I\nwant to revisit some of those key concepts through doing some retrieval practice\nand checking for understanding as this is core knowledge which will be built\nupon later in the unit. I want to ensure that every pupil has a solid\nunderstanding of the content and embeds the ideas into their long-term memory.\nI'm going to ask questions and pupils will show me their answers on whiteboards\nand this is a routine that is now really well-established. And I want to check\nthat pupils know the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    To know that a producer is a living thing that produces its own food from\n    sunlight\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To know that a consumer is a living thing that doesn’t make its own food and\n    gets its energy from eating either plants or animals\n  </li>\n  <li>To know that a primary consumer eats the producer</li>\n</ul>\n<em>\n  \"Okay, so the last time we did some work on this, we did some thinking about\n  food chains. Now food chains are an energy transfer from one species to\n  another and all living things need energy for growth and for health. Now we're\n  just going to check some of your knowledge on that before we build on it with\n  new content and so we're going to do a retrieval quiz.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  In a moment, you're going to see some questions on the board. There'll be\n  three options to choose from, one of those will be correct. So you're going to\n  have A, B and C and only one will be correct. To show me what you're thinking,\n  I want you to write down the letter on the whiteboard of the response that you\n  think is the correct answer. And then I will count down as usual from three,\n  two, one, and then say, show me.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So if you get your whiteboard and pen and you'll have 20 seconds to do that\n  and then show me you're ready by folding your arms and facing this way. Okay.\n  Go.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupils get whiteboards ready]</em>\n\n<em>\n   Right, so we've got question one here, and we're thinking about what is the\n  definition of a producer? Option A is: A living thing that does not produce\n  its own food. Is it B: A living thing that produce its own food from sunlight,\n  nutrients and water? Or is it option C: A living or non-living thing that\n  produces its own food from sunlight, nutrients, and water. You've got five\n  seconds to write your answer on your whiteboard. Three, two, one, show me.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupils hold their white boards up and teacher scans the class]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay. Demi, now you've chosen option B, just talk me through why you didn't\n  choose option C.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Pupil gives response]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Okay. Great, I'm really pleased that you pulled out the fact that a producer\n  is a living thing that produces its own food. Great. Alright everyone, so\n  here's our next question.

So first, before designing my check for understanding questions I thought about the essential knowledge of this unit which the pupils need to acquire. In this case, I identified that it's essential that pupils know what a producer and a consumer is, and that they can explain the difference between a primary and a secondary consumer. I prioritized my questions on this because I need to be sure that my pupils are secure about this particular content.\n\nSecond, I sequenced this lesson to check that pupils were secure about this foundational knowledge right from the beginning. So any gaps or misconceptions at this stage could cause problems later in the topic. And also if pupils are under-confident with the knowledge itself, they would not be successful at the independent practice later in this lesson. It's crucial that I check the most important content before moving on and getting them to apply it.\n\nWhen designing the questions I considered some of the misconceptions that were common and rational and included these to check that pupils had a really secure understanding of the foundational knowledge. I was conscious that if I included false statements that were obviously false, the pupils may guess the answers and that could really get in the way of understanding how pupil learning is going.\n\nBy checking for gaps in knowledge or misconceptions, and then addressing them, I can increase the chance of pupils' success in future learning.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored why it is important that pupils acquire knowledge\nbefore teachers ask them to apply it and some of the ways in which teachers can tell\nthat knowledge is secure. Before we finish, take a moment to read over the key ideas\nthat we have covered. Which of the following ideas do you think that the example\nbest illustrates?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the\n    subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these\n    critical components\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before\n    encountering more complex content\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical\n    knowledge and skills\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nLearning something new takes time. We need to be patient and allow for lots of\nopportunities to practice because this hard work will be worth it. Acquiring\nknowledge securely helps pupils to apply it in lots of different ways.\n\n&nbsp;\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S5.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMs Smith has a clear sense of her learning goals and is confident at breaking the curriculum down into small, meaningful components. However, she struggles to know how quickly can she get pupils doing complicated thinking and when she should introduce more sophisticated tasks.\n\n## Key idea\n\nStudents must develop solid foundations of knowledge through carefully sequenced teaching and practice if they are to develop and apply sophisticated mental models.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Mastering foundational knowledge and linking using core concepts\n\nMs Smith is already aware of the value of building her pupils’ subject knowledge, the risks of pupils’ misconceptions and the potential for knowledge gaps. She wants her students to solve problems and think critically, but they cannot do so if they have critical knowledge gaps and she has noticed that weak prior knowledge leads to misconceptions. This is because pupils use knowledge integrated in their long-term memory to learn more complex ideas and successfully apply what they have learned (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\nThis implies that:\n\n1. The sequence in which knowledge is introduced is crucial. For example, pupils are likely to struggle to evaluate the effectiveness of international aid if they are unclear about the challenges facing developing countries. They are likely to struggle to master algebra if their grasp of number is weak. This means Ms Smith needs to sequence the introduction of new ideas carefully so that _foundational knowledge_ is introduced first. It also means she needs to check pupils have relevant prior knowledge before she introduces new ideas.\n2. Ms Smith needs to highlight the link between past learning and new ideas to pupils – or help pupils to make those links themselves – so that they gain a deeper and better-organised understanding of the subject. Pupils learn new ideas with reference to what they already know (Deans for Impact, 2015), but Ms Smith cannot be sure they will make these links unprompted. Using core concepts help with these links.\n\nHaving broken down the knowledge she hopes pupils will gain and sequenced this carefully through one or more lessons, she can identify effective ways to introduce these ideas.\n\n### Teaching abstract ideas\n\nMs Smith needs to ensure pupils acquire foundational knowledge and core concepts successfully, and that she does not begin more complicated activities too soon. It’s easy for a relative expert in a topic – like Ms Smith – to grasp the abstract concepts and apply them. For example, she sees ongoing struggles over how much power ordinary people have throughout the political events of the nineteenth century; she uses symbolic representations of chemical reactions to understand what is happening in an (invisible) chemical reaction; and she can use the slope and intercept within a line graph to write an equation for that graph. However, for novices, abstract ideas can be particularly hard to grasp. If Ms Smith opens each of these topics with the abstract ideas, pupils may struggle to grasp them.\n\nConcrete examples are much easier to understand (Willingham, 2009): in each case, pupils are likely to find it easier to first encounter the concrete example then to identify the underlying abstract principle. For pupils to be able to use both, Ms Smith needs to connect and integrate abstract and concrete ideas, and show the links between them (Pashler et al., 2007). An understanding of the abstract features allows pupils to successfully apply subject knowledge and concepts in new situations: for example, an understanding of the structure of a narrative can help them comprehend a new text.\n\n### Checking pupil understanding and offering opportunities for practice\n\nMs Smith needs to check pupil understanding before beginning tasks which ask pupils to apply their new learning. She could use diagnostic questions, presenting pupils with several options, working with colleagues to identify answers which are either correct or common misconceptions. Pupils' responses allow her to identify pupils who hold misconceptions and ensure they have grasped key ideas before continuing (Christodoulou, 2017). Ms Smith needs to ask herself, “how would I know pupils have acquired enough knowledge to practise successfully?”\n\nOnce pupils have enough knowledge, Ms Smith can ensure pupils practise applying it through meaningful tasks which promote their learning of new ideas (Willingham, 2009). Although pupils will initially have inflexible knowledge – knowledge which they struggle to apply to new contexts – through continued thinking and processing of new ideas, they will come to use this knowledge increasingly flexibly (Willingham, 2002).\n\n### **Nuances and caveats**\n\nEnsuring pupils have mastered foundational knowledge and core concepts depends on first identifying what is core – fundamental to understanding the topic and discipline – which she will return to many times to ensure pupils have successfully acquired them.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMs Smith can help pupils to acquire and apply ideas by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Sequencing subject knowledge and concepts and linking them to pupil prior\n    knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Modelling new processes and ideas, linking concrete and abstract models.\n  </li>\n  <li>Checking pupil understanding before encouraging independent practice.</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nPashler, H., Bain, P.

We want\nthem to be able to solve complex problems in the wider world. In order to do that,\ntheir knowledge needs to be deeply rooted so that they don't forget it and well connected\nso that they can spot when they should use it. To deepen understanding, teachers\nneed to give pupils plenty of opportunities to think about new content and help them\nto connect that knowledge together.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nDeepening understanding means thinking of ways to ensure that pupils can remember\nand use what they learn in the long term. It means helping pupils to develop knowledge\nthat is securely embedded so that they don't forget it. It also means ensuring that\nknowledge is well connected. This makes it more likely that pupils will be able to\ntransfer their knowledge from one context to another, which can be hard to do. For\nexample, if pupils connect business letters with formal writing and they know the\ndifferent elements of formal writing, when they are given a task to write a business\nletter it should prompt them to recall relevant knowledge such as:\n<ul>\n  <li>to write in a formal style</li>\n  <li>to limit overly descriptive language</li>\n  <li>to avoid the use of abbreviations</li>\n</ul>\nThe better connected our knowledge is, the more useful it is to us. How then can\nteachers help pupils to deepen their understanding?\n\nOne way to ensure a depth of understanding is to identify the essential concepts, knowledge and skills of a subject, and revisit these big ideas over time. There is a limit to how many ideas teachers can revisit, so they need to make sure that they are selecting the most important ones. What is the core content of a lesson or unit of work?\n\nAnother way to deepen understanding is to help pupils develop connections between content. In particular it can be helpful if teachers switch between concrete examples and abstract concepts and make links between the two clear. Concrete examples tend to be specific to a particular task, whereas abstract concepts can apply across a range of different examples. Abstract concepts are like the glue that holds related content together. This is likely to help pupils to retrieve relevant content in the future. For example, when teaching multiplication, you might first use physical objects to create multiple groups and show that say 2 X 3 = 6. This would be a good concrete example. Later you might introduce multiplication of written numbers sticking with two times, again, as an abstract example.\n\nFinally, teachers can provide pupils with a range of different examples when teaching key concepts. Not only does this help pupils to identify the underlying principles that occur in each example, but it also provides them with more opportunities to create connections between content. In English, teachers might teach the concept of tragedy in a variety of texts, such as \"Othello\", \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"The Crucible\" and see how it is similar and different in each context. Regular purposeful practice of content across a range of different contexts helps pupils to develop a more secure understanding. Varying the context of practice can also help pupils to develop knowledge which they can apply more widely.\n\nUltimately, deepening understanding is about building mental models that are securely rooted and well connected. The greater the depth of understanding, the more likely pupils are to remember and apply what they learn in the future.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see a model of how to interleave concrete and abstract\nexamples. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Draws attention to the underlying structure of problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nFor the purpose of this model, imagine I'm teaching a year seven Geography\nclass. I'm going to explain to them what a protective measure is. I'm doing this\nso that I can model how to interleave concrete and abstract examples.\n\n<em>\n  “We can't prevent natural hazards from occurring. What we can do is put into\n  place measures to reduce their impact on local populations. We call these\n  protective measures. They're put in place in advance of a natural hazard in\n  order to reduce the amount of damage the natural hazard causes.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Today, we're going to look at an example from a country where earthquakes are\n  common. One example of a protective measure against earthquakes is to design\n  our buildings to absorb the earthquake's energy. One way of doing this is\n  called cross bracing where a structure comprised of steel beams crossing each\n  other is built into the building, supporting the building's frame [teacher\n  draws example on white board]\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The cross bracing absorbs the energy from the earthquake preventing the\n  building from falling down. So the architects have thought about this while\n  they were designing the building. They thought about it in advance of an\n  earthquake happening. They haven't prevented the earthquake from occurring,\n  but they've reduced the amount of damage that the earthquake does.”\n</em>\n\nIn this model, there are several examples where I interleaved concrete and abstract content. The original definition of a protective measure is an abstract concept. A protective measure is something we put in place in advance of a natural hazard to reduce the effect it might have. Using cross bracing when designing buildings, so that they absorb energy from an earthquake is a concrete example of this abstract concept. This concrete example helps people as to understand what I mean by a protective measure. It gives them something to hold onto.\n\nSecondly, I drew attention to the underlying structure that is present in both the abstract concept and the concrete example. I did this by using precisely the same language both times. I talked about putting things in place in advance to reduce the effect. By using the same language, I'm repeating the underlying structure which helps people to notice it. It isn't enough to simply alternate between abstract and concrete concepts. Teachers also need to identify how they are similar. The underlying structure is present in both examples and it has this underlying structure that we want pupils to remember.\n\nTo create this example, I came up with a definition of the abstract concept, identified a concrete example, and looked for ways in which the example illustrated key aspects of the concept that I'd included in my definition.\n\nThis is just one way in which teachers can interleave abstract and concrete examples to deepen understanding. To be effective, teachers need to look for ways to do this across a sequence of learning and gradually reduce the need to rely on concrete examples as a support.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have looked at why it is important to deepen pupil understanding.\nAnd some of the ways in which teachers may do this. Take a moment now to read over\nthe key ideas that we have covered. Which of the following ideas do you feel the\nexample illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Revisiting the big ideas of the subject over time and teaching key concepts\n    through a range of examples\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Interleaving concrete and abstract examples, slowly withdrawing concrete\n    examples and drawing attention to the underlying structure of problems\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nWhatever subject or phase we are teaching, it is important to remember that\nteaching pupils something once or in just one way will never be enough to\nprovide a secure understanding. Instead, we need to look for ways that we can\ndeepen understanding so that pupils can retain and use what they learn in lots\nof different ways.\n\n&nbsp;\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S6.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones has worked to identify and convey the key ideas in each topic to his pupils. However, he wants pupils to develop more than a basic, inflexible knowledge of the facts: he wants them to develop sophisticated mental models of the subject which allow them to apply what they have learnt to new and complex problems. How can he support his pupils to develop the kind of mental model which makes this deep thinking possible?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can develop increasingly complex pupil mental models by promoting practise of thinking which supports pupils to access and apply their subject knowledge flexibly; carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Deep thinking requires background knowledge\n\nMr Jones wants his pupils to be able to tackle new problems, to think critically and to be creative. Pupils must have good mental models to do so. Mr Jones cannot simply ask his pupils to think critically about a source, a problem or an image. This is because pupils need background knowledge, an understanding of how to think critically in the subject and the habits of doing so (Bailin et al., 1999). For example, to think critically about the design of an experiment, pupils need to know what effective experiment design looks like, what equipment is available, the goal of the experiment and so on. In the same vein, they rely on existing mental models to solve problems and come up with ideas which are creative but also feasible.\n\n### Deep thinking relies on flexible knowledge\n\nThe first step in developing mental models to permit deep thinking is moving from inflexible to flexible knowledge. When pupils learn about a new idea, their knowledge is inflexible: tied to the context in which it was learned. This cannot be avoided, it is how new information enters long-term memory: “a natural step on the way to the deeper knowledge that we want our students to have” (Willingham, 2002). For example, if Mr Jones introduces addition through an example about a child collecting feathers, pupils will associate it initially with feathers.\n\nHaving gained inflexible knowledge, pupils’ knowledge can become more flexible if they access it through different cues: increasingly varied and difficult questions with decreasing amounts of scaffolding and hints.\n\nEffective forms of variation include:\n\n- **Contextual variation:** Encountering the same knowledge in different contexts.\n- **Conceptual variation:** Presenting examples and non-examples to refine understanding.\n- **Situational variation:** Providing a broad range of application problems in pursuit of a more generalised understanding of a concept (Pan & Rickard, 2018).\n\nBy doing this, Mr Jones balances the desire to make the task more difficult – increasing the level of thinking required – and the wish to ensure pupils’ continued success, for its own sake and to maintain their motivation.\n\n### Transfer is more likely if pupils are proficient at accessing their knowledge\n\nMr Jones also wants pupils to be able to transfer what they learn to new topics, and even to other subjects within and beyond school. Transfer means being able to apply existing knowledge to new questions and situations (Barnett & Ceci, 2002). For example, he may want pupils to recognise that they can use a previously learned technique to answer a new question – using the idea of perimeter in a more complex maths problem, or maybe an everyday problem they need to solve. He may want them to see similarities between topics or ideas and themes across lessons, topics, or subjects. However, transfer is difficult and does not come naturally – pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.\n\nTransfer can be supported by retrieval practice – the act of recalling prior knowledge. After completing a unit, pupils can be asked to retrieve core knowledge and concepts frequently to ensure they retain them (Pashler et al., 2007). This makes it more likely that pupils will be able to transfer knowledge to new contexts (Pan & Rickard, 2018). When planning, teachers should think about which aspects of subject knowledge are most significant for pupils – ideas and concepts that are pre-requisite to developing knowledge in other topics – and build in retrieval practice to ensure that that these are readily accessible.\n\n### Pupils must practise deep thinking\n\nRegular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help pupils to develop and consolidate their mental models (Pashler et al., 2007). If Mr Jones wants pupils to transfer ideas to new or unfamiliar contexts, or to think deeply, he must show them how to do so and offer opportunities to practise. Mr Jones should seek to show pupils the links between topics he hopes they will make. He might say: “we can use what you have learned in English about paragraph structure and grammar when writing in History. You have also been studying Victorian novels which you can use to illustrate what some Victorians might have thought about the Industrial Revolution, as long as you make clear it’s fiction. What other learning can we use to make our historical writing better?” Likewise, if he wants them to think critically about a topic, he has to offer practice in this kind of thinking, he cannot rely on the accumulation of factual knowledge to lead to critical thinking automatically.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nTransfer and critical thinking are both hard: neither of them come naturally – if teachers want pupils to think critically and to transfer knowledge to new contexts, they must teach this explicitly and allow pupils to practise doing so.\n\nPupils cannot exercise critical thinking without a strong knowledge of the thing about which they are being invited to think critically: teachers are unlikely to experience success if they teach critical thinking skills in isolation or expect pupils to transfer knowledge from one context to another without practice and models.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can promote deep thinking by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Seeing deep thinking as an extension of pupils’ mental models of the\n    subject.\n  </li>\n  <li>Helping pupils access knowledge more flexibly.</li>\n  <li>\n    Showing pupils how to apply knowledge to new problems and contexts and\n    supporting them to practise this.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nWillingham, D.

Literacy is about words that we encounter in\nspeech and text and the ways in which we use them. Whatever subject you teach, words\nare a critical way in which you share meaning. Every subject provides opportunities\nto develop pupil literacy and every teacher needs to consider how they can do this\nwell.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nLiteracy is about our use of words. To access the curriculum, pupils need to understand\nthe meaning of a vast array of words, whether they come across them in speech or\ntext. Literacy applies to speaking, listening, reading and writing. When it applies\nto reading, literacy is the ability to read words through sight recognition and decoding\nusing phonological knowledge and to comprehend their meaning within a specific context.\n\nBut words alone are not enough. Literacy is also about knowledge. In order to comprehend what someone says to us or what we read, we need to draw on what we know in order to accurately interpret the words that they use. For example, if pupils read a text about an area of wetlands, they will need to know what a wetland is even in very basic terms before they can properly understand what they read. In a science classroom, we may teach pupils specific words to label the different parts of the heart but if they don't know that the heart is the organ that pumps blood around the body, they will find it much harder to understand what these words mean or to remember them. This also applies to knowledge of how we read and write certain texts. If you don't know how an information text is typically organized, for example, you'll find it harder to follow what it means. As well as thinking about the words that they use, teachers need to ensure that pupil secure the underlying knowledge that they need for understanding.\n\nGiven that literacy is so critical to all learning, what are some of the practical ways in which all teachers can develop pupil literacy? Teachers need to plan for, teach, model and provide opportunities to practise the various aspects of literacy that they want to develop.\n\nTo begin with, teachers need to think about how they can develop pupils' vocabulary. Lots of the words that pupils come across at school will be unfamiliar. We need to identify key words in advance and explicitly teach them to pupils. When teaching a new word, one strategy that teachers can use is to introduce the word, define it using words that pupils will understand and then give a few examples of its use in practice. Teachers can continue to use this specific vocabulary in their own speech, scaffolding pupil understanding by pausing to clarify what it means. Teachers also need to give pupils lots of opportunities to practise using new vocabulary. Getting pupils to use new words in speech first can be particularly effective. Oral literacy supports reading and writing. One way of developing vocabulary through oracy is to provide vocabulary banks of keywords and ask pupils to rephrase what they say with words from the vocabulary bank. Practising using vocabulary and speech helps pupils to learn new words and refine their thinking.\n\nTeachers also need to think about how they can teach words that are specific to a subject. These are called tier three words and pupils may not encounter them outside of the subject but they will help pupils to access and think about a subject if they know them. Words like evaporation, circumference and figurative language. Also every subject has its own styles of writing. Pupils need to see a model of a particular type of text and teachers need to identify its key features. Writing frames can be a useful tool to support pupils as they learn about different types of texts.\n\nSome lessons will provide more opportunities than others to develop literacy. A lesson that's focused primarily on a practical task like learning to kick a football will provide fewer opportunities to develop literacy than an English lesson. But even in entirely practical lessons, teachers and pupils still use words. Teachers need to choose the words that they use carefully and make the most of every opportunity they have to develop pupil literacy.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you will see one way of teaching a new word to a class. As you\nwatch, pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Provides a concrete model of the word that she is teaching</li>\n  <li>Uses high-quality talk to support pupils to extend their vocabulary</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>I want you to imagine that I'm\nteaching a year four class during a unit of work on the Romans. I'm going to\nmodel how to explicitly teach a new word to them. It's early on in the unit and\nwe're learning about when and why the Romans first invaded Britain. In this\nexample, I want to explicitly teach the word and meaning of the word invade. I\nwant to be sure that all the class know the word as it's important for their\nunderstanding of the wider topic.\n\n<em>\n  “In 55 and 54 B.C., the Roman army invaded Britain. My turn, your turn,\n  invade.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  The word invade means when a group of people enter country to take control and\n  steal its resources. In a sentence, you might say the Roman army invaded\n  Britain or the army wanted to invade the country to steal its resources. You\n  could also say the country was invaded if it happened in the past. Now discuss\n  with your partner what you think the word invade means.\n</em>\n\n<em>[Teacher scans classroom as pupils discuss]</em>\n\n<em>One, two, three eyes on me. So what does invade mean? Connor. </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers: </em>\n<em>invade means when an army comes and takes over a country]</em>\n\n<em>Thank you. Can we add to that? Elliot. </em>\n\n<em>[Pupil answers: i</em>\n<em>nvade is when battles happen]</em>\n\n<em>\n  Thank you. An invasion is when a group of people enter country to take control\n  and to steal its resources. Elliot is partly right. Often when a group\n  invades, there is a battle but not always. So we're not going to include that\n  in our definition.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Now with your partner, come up with a sentence that uses the word invade or\n  invaded. Use what you know about the Vikings to help you with your sentences.\n  One minute.”\n</em>\n\nI want to draw your attention to a couple of features of this model. Remember that the purpose was to explicitly teach a new word. First, I explicitly introduced the word invade. I said the word clearly and asked the class to repeat it. I did this for two reasons: firstly, I wanted pupils to experience saying the word so I could ensure that the pronunciation was correct. Secondly, I focused the class's attention on the word itself. I then gave pupils a clear definition of what the word invade means with a few more examples. This is a routine that I have developed with pupils and they now understand it well. They knew that when I said your turn, they needed to state the word back to me in unison.\n\nSecond, I used high-quality talk to help the pupils extend their vocabulary. Pupils practise using the word invade first in pairs. This helps them to process their understanding of it and rehearse using it in a safe context. Pupils often stumble when learning new vocabulary so this time practising it is really important. Once pupils had a go trying out the word in pairs, I got them to share their sentences. The time that pupils have practising the word increased the quality of their talk to the whole class.\n\nAfter this, I would have got pupils to write down a definition in their books, using key words as a scaffold. This concept will come up lots in history units so it's important that pupils are secure with it. I'll support pupils to use the word invade by using it my teaching and including it in vocabulary banks or talking and writing frames. These supports will be gradually withdrawn as pupils demonstrate that they have successfully acquired this new word.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we have explored the importance of developing pupil literacy and highlighted\nsome practical ways in which all teachers can do this. Before we finish, take a moment\nto read over the key ideas that we have covered. Which of the following ideas do\nyou think that the example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Recognise that every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by\n    explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to\n    individual disciplines\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Know that modelling helps pupils to understand new processes and ideas; good\n    models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Know that high-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key\n    ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nLiteracy is fundamental to pupils' success in school and their future life\nchances. The more literate pupils are, the more that they can understand and\nlearn. Improving pupils' generic and subject specific literacy through explicit\nteaching, modelling and talk can help pupils to access a subject and drive\nlearning. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S7.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones is increasingly successful in developing pupils’ mental models and helping them to grasp crucial ideas. However, he has become concerned that their written work is not keeping pace with their understanding. He notices pupils struggling to master and use technical vocabulary, and to articulate key ideas clearly. How can Mr Jones improve pupils’ literacy within his subject, and more generally?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can improve pupils’ literacy – in general and specific to their subject – through explicit teaching, modelling, and carefully-planned reading, writing and speaking activities.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Every lesson is a chance to improve pupils’ literacy\n\nTo understand a text, pupils must both recognise the words (by decoding what sounds the letters make in this combination) and comprehend their meaning (EEF, 2018). English and literacy lessons support pupils to improve in both.\n\nHowever, Mr Jones sees every lesson as a chance to improve pupils’ literacy. Partly, this is because every lesson is a chance to reinforce and build upon what pupils learn in English and literacy lessons. Pupils benefit from additional opportunities to increase their vocabulary, to read and to practise articulating their thoughts; this may also help them to grasp the underlying principles better. In particular, additional opportunities to read are one of the most powerful ways to encounter new knowledge and to increase their vocabulary (Willingham, 2009).\n\nMoreover, English and literacy lessons do not teach the technical terms and styles of writing specific to different subjects (Scott et al., 2018): each teacher must teach the vocabulary and writing structures specific to their subject.\n\n### Developing pupils’ vocabulary\n\nMr Jones plans to improve pupils’ vocabulary in the same way he plans other aspects of the lesson. He identifies critical words – high-frequency words that pupils will use often and high-utility words that are particularly important in his subject – and introduces them explicitly. He finds it useful to distinguish between:\n\n- **Tier 1 vocabulary:** Everyday words, which might need to be taught explicitly, such as ‘good’, ‘child’ or ‘Sunday’.\n- **Tier 2 vocabulary:** Words which appear across the curriculum but less commonly in everyday speech, such as ‘examine’, ‘deceive’ or ‘forthright’.\n- **Tier 3 vocabulary:** Words which are specific to a subject: for example, in science, pupils need to grasp the scientific meaning of terms such as ‘evaporation’ (Beck et al., 2002; EEF, 2018).\n\nHis focus is on teaching Tier 2 words – which pupils are unlikely to pick up without teaching – and Tier 3 words, which they are unlikely to encounter outside his lessons.\n\n### Modelling reading and writing\n\nModels are a powerful way to show pupils how to articulate key ideas. Models help pupils understand new processes and ideas by making them more concrete and accessible (Willingham, 2009). For any written task, pupils need to see an example – or ideally more than one – and break it into its constituent parts: this may mean examining examples of coherent sentences, clear reports or well-structured essays. Pupils can use these as models to guide their own writing. Likewise, teachers can model the process of reading and writing: for example, articulating their own thinking such as the questions and predictions they are making, or showing pupils how expert readers comprehend texts (EEF, 2016).\n\n### Talking is preparation for writing\n\nClassroom dialogue is an opportunity for pupils to practise articulating ideas clearly: this is both valuable for its own sake and to consolidate pupils’ understanding in preparation for their writing. Promoting better talk practices in classrooms directly improves pupils’ outcomes in core subjects and appears to improve their confidence and participation (Jay et al., 2017). For example, Mr Jones might model accurate use of terminology and the language structures he hopes pupils will use. He could also invite pupils to articulate their ideas fully and accurately in speech. Doing so is an opportunity for them to practise and refine how they express ideas, making subsequent writing easier.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhile literacy development can be a feature of every lesson, some will lend themselves to this better than others. All subjects have specialist vocabulary which pupils should be taught to use accurately; likewise, all subjects can promote high-quality talk during discussion.\n\nHowever, if the key learning goal is practical – learning to pass a football correctly, shade accurately or master times tables – teachers should not feel that they are expected to create written activities solely to promote generic literacy.\n\nPromoting literacy might also look different at different ages. For example, for younger pupils, a priority is reading fluently and writing fluently and legibly, whereas once pupils have mastered this they may benefit from improving their reading comprehension skills, or from more time planning, drafting and editing their writing (EEF, 2018).\n\nPromoting reading for pleasure, by using a range of whole-class reading approaches and regularly exposing pupils to high-quality texts, can also support literacy development (EEF, 2016).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can help pupils to improve their literacy by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identifying literacy goals for a topic, such as vocabulary to use,\n    challenging texts to read, and forms of writing to practise.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Sharing and breaking down models of the reading and writing he hopes pupils\n    will master.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Planning opportunities for high-quality talk, which use key vocabulary to\n    articulate crucial ideas.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nEEF (2018).

Teachers need to identify the\nprecise features that make the example effective. We need to break it down for our\npupils. Academic expectations need to be clear, concrete, and specific if we want\nour pupils to meet them.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nKnowing what success looks like helps pupils to achieve, particularly when the teachers\npoint out the details within a successful piece of work. Concrete examples help to\ncovey complicated concepts to pupils. They also help pupils to see what good looks\nlike. Knowing what good looks like can in turn help pupils to monitor their work\nmore effectively, leading to improved learning.\n\nThere are several ways that teachers can share academic expectations. Constructing models that show pupils what good looks like makes abstract goals concrete. Hearing that they need to argue more systematically doesn't mean anything unless they already know what arguing systematically means and looks like. Showing examples can help. For example, a teacher might present pupils with a neatly formed letter, an accurate labeling of a diagram, or a good introduction to an essay.\n\nWhen teachers present models, they need to direct pupils' attention to the important features within them. Without doing this, pupils often skip over them entirely or miss key details. Also, novice learners tend to focus on surface-level features that are specific to one particular model. Showing a range of different examples can help pupils to see the underlying principles that are present in each of them. For example, seeing a range of different ways to write the introduction to an essay question can show pupils that whereas they may have different ideas to share, introductory paragraphs should always respond to the question and present the main ideas that the essay will discuss. They can compare their work to the example, helping them to make improvements.\n\nIf you know what a good example looks like, you're more likely to carry out a task well.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see a model of how to share academic expectations. As\nyou watch, pay attention to the following key ideas:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Sets tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a\n    challenging curriculum\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Narrates thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts think\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute Coach</h3>\nImagine I'm teaching a year seven Geography lesson. We've been looking at the\nimpact of transnational corporations on Nigeria's development and I want them to\nanswer a question that summarizes their learning through a case study of the\nfast food chain KFC.\n\n<em>\n  “In a moment, you're going to answer a question. I'm going to show you one way\n  of responding to it so that you can see how I do it well. Here's the question:\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Explain whether you think the presence of KFC is a positive or a negative\n  development for Nigeria.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Firstly, I'm looking at the words within the question. It's asking us to\n  explain what we think. So I need to decide if I think the presence of KFC is a\n  positive or a negative development for Nigeria. And then I need to justify my\n  answer using evidence from the text.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  And secondly, I need to come up with some ideas. So I'll be thinking about\n  what we've learned this lesson. And we've seen from the text that there are\n  both positives and negatives to the presence of KFC in Nigeria. On balance, I\n  think the presence of KFC in Nigeria would be a negative development.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So that's going to be my first sentence. You might think the opposite, and\n  that's fine, because this question is asking for your opinion. I'm going to be\n  using some of the words from the question to help get me started. So in my\n  head I'll be thinking, \"I believe the presence of KFC is a negative\n  development for Nigeria.\" And then I will write.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  [Teacher writes on whiteboard] I believe the presence of KFC is a negative\n  development for Nigeria. And notice that I've used the words taken from the\n  question. So presence, presence, negative development, negative development.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Then I need to justify my answer using evidence from the text. And I'm going\n  to use three statements from within the text, but there are more than three\n  statements within this piece of text. Some of them positive and some of them\n  negative. So I need to choose the three pieces of information that best\n  support my opening sentence, and I need to choose the strongest.”\n</em>\n\nThis is just the opening of the model, but it is enough to demonstrate some of the key ideas about sharing good examples with pupils. First, the task itself is challenging. Pupils have to pull together a range of different pieces of evidence into a coherent argument. They have to recall what they know about developments in Nigeria and apply it to the question. Pupils are supported to achieve this task because I know that they have a good understanding of the content. The model that I am providing here is another form of support.\n\nSecond, I narrated my thought process out loud to show pupils how experts think. For example, I'm going to use some of the words from the question to get me started. This might seem like an obvious thing to do, but pupils often struggle to get started and so it is worth pointing it out. How can we be sure that pupils will know to do this if nobody has ever told them?\n\nFinally, I drew attention to some of the features of the example that made it good. In particular, I stressed that the evidence that I select needs to match with my overall point. Again, this is something that experts who know how to construct a good argument would do instinctively, but in order to develop expertise, it helps if we identify the specific knowledge and skills that it is made up of. Providing a model of an excellent response does not remove all of the cognitive effort required. This isn't about getting pupils to copy. Pupils will still have to think about the content carefully when writing their own response. The purpose of the model is to help to guide their thinking and, in doing this, it increases the likelihood of success.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've explored the importance of showing pupils what a model of success\nlooks like, ensuring that we set our expectation high. Before we finish, take a moment\nto read over the key ideas in the video. Which of the following ideas do you think\nthe example illustrated the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Setting tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a\n    challenging curriculum\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need\n    more structure early in a domain\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Narrating thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts\n    think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working\n    independently and drawing pupils’ attention to links with prior knowledge)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nWe all want our pupils to do well, both in school and future life.

However, he is unsure how to give them the best opportunity to perform well and demonstrate their understanding. He finds that describing the components of a strong piece of work is useful but often insufficient to convey the key ideas. How can he share his academic expectations for pupils concretely and clearly?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffectively directing pupil attention to high-quality models helps pupils succeed by clarifying subject goals. Practice and metacognition help them apply these to their own work.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Models show pupils how to succeed\n\nConveying academic expectations to pupils is challenging. Effective teachers set goals that challenge and stretch pupils, while providing enough support to make it likely pupils will succeed (Coe et al., 2014). Previously, Mr Jones has focused on describing to pupils what they need to do to succeed. However, he has found this problematic: he invites pupils to structure sentences “carefully”, to select the “most telling quotations” and to approach their work “methodically”. Some pupils seem able to do this but for others his advice appears not to help. Mr Jones realises that these concepts may be too abstract to be easily applied by many pupils so he needs a better way to convey them (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\nModels can show what pupils need to do to succeed. Mr Jones has already encountered the power of a concrete example in making abstract curricular concepts and ideas accessible. He realises that they can also be used to show pupils how to succeed in a specific task. He can use models to demonstrate the components of a good response and the process behind constructing one. One approach is to show pupils completed models, such as a finished calculation, sentence, or essay paragraph. He can also show pupils the process of creating an answer, either by showing finished worked examples (Sweller et al., 1998) – for example, the stages of a sum or an edited document – or by live modelling: completing a task or editing an answer in front of pupils and talking about his thinking process (EEF, 2017). This is a chance for Mr Jones to share his subject expertise with pupils, by describing the choices he is making and the reasons for them as he is making them.\n\n### How teachers use their models matters\n\nMr Jones recognises that the design of the model is important but insufficient in helping pupils identify crucial features as pupils may be tempted to skip over examining them (Sweller et al., 1998). Effective modelling involves directing pupils’ attention to the most important aspects. Some specific tasks appear to help pupils engage with models and identify their critical features. These include:\n\n- **Completion problems:** Partially completed examples which pupils finish (Sweller et al., 1998).\n- **Example-problem pairs:** An example with an equivalent problem, for the pupil to complete.\n- **Examples contrasted with non-examples:** Helping pupils contrast strong and weak responses allows them to identify the crucial features of good answers and those which are less important (Lin-Siegler et al., 2015; EEF, 2018).\n\nThe crucial point which Mr Jones appreciates is that just producing a model is insufficient to ensure pupils benefit: he must also design a task which ensures pupils engage with it, effectively modelling the features he wishes to convey.\n\nMr Jones can also use models to provide feedback and help pupils to improve. For example, once pupils have completed a task, Mr Jones can invite them to return to the model and identify the similarities and differences between their approach and the one illustrated by the model. Alternatively, he can construct a new model which incorporates the strongest (or weakest) features of pupils’ answers, and then invite them to review it and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Pupils can then be invited to revise their own work with the model in mind.\n\n### Promoting metacognition\n\nModels can also promote pupils’ metacognition by helping them to get a clear sense of what their work should look like. This makes it easier for them to plan and monitor their work – comparing what they are doing to the model – and to evaluate their approach by making adaptations if they notice that their work does not exhibit key features shown in the model (EEF, 2017). This may be particularly important where a teacher anticipates common misconceptions may arise about a topic. Pupils may have acquired ideas, either in school or from everyday experience, that are ‘in conflict with’ the to-be-learned concepts (Chi, 2009).\n\nMr Jones can use his models to draw pupil attention to misconceptions as well as ways to overcome them. For example, as he models how complete a problem, he might ask pupils “What trap are we going to avoid falling into here?” and emphasise that “I’m going to avoid falling into this trap”, showing them what he wants them to do instead. Knowing what is expected of pupils and what they should avoid is therefore a powerful way to help pupils to monitor and evaluate their own work.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhen sharing academic expectations, it is important both to select a high-quality model and use effective instructional approaches when modelling, drawing pupil attention to specific aspects of the model to develop their subject knowledge.\n\nMr Jones can discuss with experienced colleagues what important misconceptions are to help identify them.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can show pupils how to succeed by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Constructing models which show pupils what a good response or performance\n    looks like.\n  </li>\n  <li>Directing pupils’ attention to the critical aspects of those models.</li>\n  <li>Using those models to promote metacognition and for feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nEEF (2017).

They make decisions about whether a pupil has understood something\nor if they need to go back and reteach it. In order to ensure that we make good decisions\nand act in ways that will have the most impact on pupils' learning, we need to think\ncarefully about what we assess and how we assess it. Designing and delivering formative\nassessment can help teachers make better decisions.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>A great way of understanding what formative assessment is,\nis to consider the definition that Paul Black and Dylan William gave in their influential\nwork 'Inside the Black Box'. And assessment is formative if it leads a teacher to\nmake a better decision about next steps. Effective formative assessment allows teachers\nto develop an understanding of how learning is going and to make decisions about\nhow they'll adapt their teaching. This is different from summative assessment, which\nis designed to demonstrate what pupils have learned. By the time that teachers get\ninformation back from summative assessment, it's often too late to do anything about\nit. Designing and delivering formative assessment allows teachers to make decisions\nabout how and what they're teaching as they go.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important decisions that teachers make and will need to make most regularly is this: I've taught my pupils something, have they understood it? And are they ready to move on? Formative assessment needs to be carefully designed so that it gives teachers the answers to these important questions. It needs to be linked to the key learning in the lesson.\n\nHere's one approach that teachers can take when designing formative assessment. First, identify what the most important content in the lesson is. They also need to identify the most likely misconceptions related to it. We want to know if pupils have understood the key content and if they hold any misconceptions that will get in the way. Next, teachers need to design a question that tests for one piece of information at a time, that way you'll have a better chance of identifying the specific problem that you need to address. Finally, once you've designed a question it's really important that you test it out, for example with your mentor, to check that it tells you what you want to know. Sometimes we come up with what looks like a great question, but when we test it out, it doesn't tell us the information that we need. For example, you might want to know whether a pupil can add tens and units together. Say you decided to give them a word maths problem like this: Adam has 10 apples in his basket and puts two more in. How many apples does he have? The problem with a question like this is that it requires pupils to know how to read as well as how to add tens and units. If they get the answer wrong, how are you going to know if the problem lies with their ability to add up or with their ability to read it? It could be the pupil's understanding of addition is secure. In this instance, the teacher won't be able to use this information to decide whether or not they've understood enough about addition of tens and units to move on. So it won't be effective formative assessment.\n\nAs well as designing formative assessment carefully, teachers also need to think about how to deliver it. Pupils need a positive learning environment in order to feel comfortable making mistakes. It's helpful to explain to pupils why you're giving them an assessment and that you want to know if they've understood what you've taught them and if they're ready to move on. In an EYFS setting, the assessment may take the form of a one-to-one conversation with a pupil. Having a strong relationship of trust and mutual respect will provide an important basis for this.\n\nOne further point is that while formative assessment is good at capturing what pupils have understood in the moment, it's not always the most reliable way of telling you how secure learning is. A correct answer might be a lucky guess, or it might be pupils have performed well because the content is fresh in their minds. It's quite possible that pupils will have forgotten by the next lesson. Teachers will need to go back to content to check whether the pupils have a secure and lasting understanding. Formative assessment is most useful for identifying pupils' misconceptions, and then knowledge gaps.\n\nWhen designed and delivered well, formative assessment can help show teachers how learning is going and help them make good decisions about what to do next.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see a model of planning formative assessment. As you\nwatch pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Plan a formative assessment task that is linked to the lesson objective\n  </li>\n  <li>Think ahead about what would indicate understanding</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Sarah Cottingham and Paula Delaney</h3>\n<em>COACH (SARAH COTTINGHAM): What's the learning goal of this lesson?</em>\n\n<em>ECT (PAULA DELANEY): To form the lowercase letter M.</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Let's think about this in a bit more detail. What key knowledge and\n  skills do you want pupils to achieve in this lesson?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: I want them to know how to accurately form the letter by starting at the\n  top of the line, using straight lines, starting the curve two thirds up the\n  straight line, ensuring the two curves are the same size and then adding that\n  flick at the end. And that's going to feed forward when they do cursive\n  handwriting as well. I want them to be able to write slowly and check for\n  accuracy, and I want them to be able to say or think the key steps for forming\n  the letter as they write.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: What tasks could you get them to do to show that they'd understood?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Well, they're going to be forming the letter M and I can check their\n  independent practice. But I also want to check that the class can articulate\n  the steps that they actually need to take. This is what's going to help them\n  in the future. So they'll have some useful prompts, like I need to remember to\n  start at the top of the line. So I could ask a series of questions that I've\n  carefully scripted to check that they have that knowledge.\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: What question would you ask to assess then each piece of the key\n  learning?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: Well, I can turn a lot of my key knowledge and skills into questions. And\n  so instead of to be able to start forming the letter at the top, I could say,\n  where should I start when I'm forming my letter or their questions are, what\n  should I take care of when drawing my downward line? Where should I start the\n  first curve? And what do I need to remember about the second curve? And why do\n  we need to take my time?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: So let's look at this question a bit more detail when you ask, what do\n  I need to remember about the second curve? Could you be more specific.\n</em>\n\n<em>ECT: How about what size should the second mentioned be?</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: Great. That narrows down the potential answers. Now let's test out this\n  question. Why do I need to take my time? I imagine that pupils could say\n  something like, to take care or, so I can be proud of my work, but you're\n  trying to check that they understand that they should be accurate. If they\n  said that they needed to take their time or so they can be proud of their\n  work, would that tell you that they needed to be accurate?\n</em>\n\n<em>ECT: Not really. </em>\n\n<em>\n  COCAH: And would it tell you that they didn't know the importance of being\n  accurate?\n</em>\n\n<em>ECT: No, because both answers could work.</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: So how could you refine the question to make sure that the answer you\n  get tells you what you want to find out?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  ECT: I could give them a couple of statements and ask them to choose which one\n  is correct. So for example, I could say, is it better to write lots of letters\n  quickly or to write one letter accurately?\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  COACH: That's a good idea. Only one of those answers is right. And the right\n  answer being accurate tells you what you want to find out.\n</em>\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've explored the importance of formative assessment and\nprovided some practical strategies for designing it.

However, he often feels unsure how much pupils have understood during the lesson or by the end. Sometimes, end-of-unit assessments suggest that pupils have failed to grasp key ideas. How can Mr Jones develop ways to identify what pupils are thinking – and what they have misunderstood – in order to ensure they are all meeting the learning goals?\n\n## Key idea\n\nEffective formative assessment shows the teacher what pupils are thinking: this makes it possible to meet pupils’ needs, making it more likely they will meet learning goals.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### The role of summative assessment\n\nMr Jones encounters many forms of external assessment on a regular basis in school. Often, pupils complete practice versions of external exams or commercially-developed tests in order to demonstrate progress or highlight gaps in their knowledge. However, the information this provides often comes too late to enable him to make the kind of changes he hopes to make. He is unwilling to wait until the end of the key stage to find out exactly how much pupils have understood.\n\nMr Jones’ initial idea is that he will adapt these external assessments and use them in his lessons. However, this proves problematic. These assessments are designed to demonstrate what pupils have learned over a long period of time (Wiliam & Black, 1996). To do so, many questions integrate knowledge of multiple concepts: a question may ask pupils to draw on their knowledge of algebra and number, to write a paragraph or to compare different concepts. Errors may not tell him whether a pupil lacks basic knowledge, misinterpreted the question or holds an underlying misconception (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\nCreating exams and ensuring they are marked reliably is a complicated, intricate and time-consuming process: this is not something an individual teacher can easily simulate (Christodoulou, 2017). Mr Jones still wants his pupils to succeed in summative assessments and he uses them to help ensure he is teaching everything pupils need to know. Moreover, if he needs to make a summative judgement, he should choose these materials where possible and draw conclusions from patterns of performance over a number of these, while remembering that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance. However, his focus is identifying what pupils have learned - or misunderstood - in order to adapt his teaching accordingly. This means he focuses on using formative assessment.\n\n### The role of formative assessment\n\nAn assessment is formative if it is designed to lead to a change in what the teacher (or the student) does (Black & Wiliam, 1998). Effective formative assessment practices help teachers collect evidence about pupil understanding and needs and adapt their teaching to support pupils to be more successful (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Speckesser et al., 2018). Mr Jones is aware of the risk of using ‘poor proxies’ for learning (Coe, 2013): of believing that students have understood because they are busy, engaged, working hard, or answering questions correctly even if they haven’t fully understood or couldn’t reproduce the work independently. All of these are valuable and desirable, but they do not show that pupils have understood the key ideas and avoided misconceptions.\n\n### Designing formative assessment\n\nMr Jones’ previous work identifying and setting clear learning goals proves useful in formulating precise assessment questions. He focuses on questions that show whether pupils have mastered the key idea in the lesson or whether they hold misconceptions – being particularly mindful of pupils with specific learning barriers linked to special educational needs or disabilities. It helps to design questions with data analysis in mind (Wiliam, 2014) and Mr Jones is mindful of this as he plans formative assessment.\n\nFor example, he knows that a fifty-question quiz will provide very detailed information about what every pupil understands but he also knows that he will not have time to review every pupils’ quiz for at least a week. It is better to decide to choose one crucial question – and use the information he gains – than to choose several important questions and run out of time to ask them or assess students’ answers. However, Mr Jones is aware that he will still need to be cautious about the conclusions he draws: pupils may produce correct answers now but struggle to recreate them in future (Coe, 2013; Christodoulou, 2017).\n\n### Using formative assessment\n\nOnce he has designed a formative assessment, Mr Jones applies it in class. He appreciates the need to gain a response from all pupils independently, since the answer of one pupil in discussion may influence that of other pupils. As a result, he gets his pupils to respond simultaneously, using whiteboards or on paper. Having collected the data, he is able to analyse it, adapt teaching and provide feedback as appropriate.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nFormative assessment, such as end of class questioning, is a powerful way to identify what pupils have understood in the moment. However, getting an answer correct one day doesn’t mean that pupils will recall it in future: they are very likely to forget some of it. Formative assessment is most useful for identifying pupils’ misconceptions or knowledge gaps and addressing them.\n\nFormative assessment is an approach, not a technique. Using mini-whiteboards, exit tasks or hinge questions does not mean a teacher is using formative assessment: what matters is why and how they are used. If they are used to find out what pupils understand and to improve their understanding, the teacher is using formative assessment and practising responsive teaching (Christodoulou, 2017).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can check pupils’ developing understanding by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Recognising that summative assessment has value but that it cannot provide\n    rapid, detailed information about pupil understanding.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Formative assessment practices can provide valuable information about what\n    pupils have understood and gaps in their knowledge.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Formative assessment should be designed around how the information it\n    provides will be used.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBlack, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., & Wiliam, D.

They gather\ninformation when they ask questions, circulate as pupils work and when they mark\ntheir work. In order to make the most of this information, it's important that teachers\npause to examine what it's telling them. By using formative assessment effectively,\nteachers are likely to make better decisions about their teaching.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nUsing formative assessment is about drawing tentative conclusions about what pupils\ndo or do not understand so the teachers can decide what to do next. Tentative language\nis important here. It's almost impossible to identify with real certainty what pupils\nare thinking and what they know. Information that teachers get from an assessment\nwill only provide them with a momentary snapshot of pupils thinking, it won't be\nthe whole picture. And yet it's still valuable information that can give teachers\na good indication of how learning is going, especially when it comes to identifying\nmisconceptions. So while we need to be careful about the conclusions that we draw,\nteachers still need to examine and use the information that they gain.\n\nFirst, teachers need to have gathered some data. Some of the ways in which teachers might do this include observing pupil's work when circulating the classroom, asking a series of questions or asking pupils to complete an exit task. An exit task is a short task that pupils complete at the end of the lesson. These tasks should be focused on the key learning of the lesson or the identification of common misconceptions and should be relatively quick to complete and to assess.\n\nOnce the data's been gathered, teachers need to think about what they can infer from it. There are a number of questions that teachers can ask themselves to help them examine and interpret the information. First, what's the mistake? Second, how many people have got this wrong? And then what might the source of the mistake be? For example, is that the result of a gap in understanding or is it a misconception? The answers to these questions will determine how teachers decide to respond. For example, teachers may infer that lots of their pupils hold a common misconception and decide to pause the lesson to address it. Or they may infer that lots of their pupils have a significant gap in understanding, and then it would be worth reteaching the relevant content in a subsequent lesson.\n\nOne of the challenges that teachers face when examining pupil responses is that they have a huge amount of information to consider and it can take a long time to do this. One way in which teachers can make this workload manageable is to prioritise looking for knowledge or understanding of the most important ideas. It's equally important to bear in mind the most common misconceptions when examining pupil work. Knowing what knowledge and misconceptions you're looking for an advance will make it easier for you to spot them when you come across them.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see a model of how to examine a set of pupils' responses\nto an exit task. As you watch pay attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Is aware of common misconceptions</li>\n  <li>\n    Draws conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of\n    performance over a number of assessments\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>I want you to imagine that\nI've just taught my year six class a lesson on adding fractions with different\ndenominators. At the planning stage, I spoke to a colleague who has taught this\ncontent effectively on many occasions, and she helped me to identify some common\nmistakes that pupils make. I designed an exit task for pupils to complete at the\nend of the lesson to see if any of them had made these mistakes. Here are the\nmost common errors that I have decided to check for.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Pupils have taken the largest number instead of identifying a common\n    denominator\n  </li>\n  <li>Pupils have added the numerator and denominator separately</li>\n  <li>Pupils have not simplified the fraction</li>\n</ul>\nHere are all the exit tasks that I've got from the class. The first thing that I\ndo is to scan them quickly to see which pupils have got the answer correct and\nwhich ones have got it wrong. I've written down the correct answer here to help\nme do this more quickly. I've divided the exit task into two piles. I'm going to\nconcentrate on this pile of incorrect answers.\n\nThe next step is to dig into these incorrect answers. I want to see which errors pupils have made. Again, the fact that I thought about these misconceptions in advance really speeds this process up. The majority of pupils have gone wrong because they forgotten to simplify the fraction. A few of them haven't found the common denominator.\n\nNow that I know this, I need to decide what to do next. I'm going to draw on information that I have from the exit task along with what I know about my pupils and the unit of work. I'm going to prioritise reteaching how to simplify a fraction at the beginning of our next lesson. Quite a few pupils have got it wrong, so it's worthwhile reteaching to the whole class. Pupils that got it right will benefit from additional practice. And I will ensure that the subsequent independent practice will include a stretch to their thinking. I'm going to hold off addressing the error of not identifying the common denominator. I first taught this to the class a few lessons ago and lots more of them have got it right, so it looks like the majority are getting the hang of this. We'll be coming back to it in a few lessons time, so I'll have another opportunity to address it then.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nThere are a couple of key points to draw out from this short example. First, the\ncoach had identified in advance which misconceptions she wanted to test for. This\nmade it much easier to spot them when interpreting exit tasks. It should also make\nher inferences more accurate because each question on the exit task targeted one\nmisconception, helping to identify a precise problem.\n\nSecond, when examining information in the exit tasks the coach considers patterns. She identified a pattern of pupils who had made particular errors and she also considered patterns of performance when she compared pupils' responses on this exit task to previous performance on the topic. Looking back at past performance provided more information with which to draw an inference. In this case that the majority of people seem to be improving their understanding of simplifying fractions. The coach was able to come to a number of likely conclusions fairly quickly and adapt her teaching and response. This was time well spent.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've considered the importance of formative assessment and some of\nthe ways in which teachers can assess formatively. Before we finish, read the key\nideas that video has covered. Which ideas has this example illustrate the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced\n    colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Monitoring pupils’ work during lessons, including checking for\n    misconceptions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of\n    performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments\n    draw inferences about learning from performance)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nFormative assessment can feel easier the more that teachers know their subject\nand their pupils. When teaching something new for the first time, it's a really\ngood idea to work with an experienced teacher when reviewing pupil assessments.\nThis can help teachers to make better decisions for their pupils, and ultimately\nimprove learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S10.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones is designing and using assessments frequently to check pupil understanding and misconceptions. However, he finds the amount of information they provide challenging to manage, particularly with so many pupil responses. He must decide what to do next rapidly, either during the lesson, or before the next. Doing this slowly during a lesson risks losing pupils’ attention; doing this slowly after the lesson adds to his workload dramatically. How can he use the information available to identify rapidly what pupils have understood, their misconceptions and their knowledge gaps?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers need a simple, systematic approach to decide how to respond to pupils’ knowledge gaps and misconceptions.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Identifying critical knowledge gaps and misconceptions\n\nWhen faced with an array of pupil responses, Mr Jones must be able to identify the crucial points rapidly. Since his goal is to develop pupils’ mental models, his focus must be on what pupils are thinking, not just on whether they have got the correct answer. Understanding pupils’ thinking allows teachers to recognise the strengths and gaps in their mental models, and to plan ways to respond (Wiliam, 2011). Mr Jones can do this best by taking a systematic approach. Teachers can use their knowledge of likely misconceptions and knowledge gaps (Ball et al., 2010) to design tasks which will reveal them. Similarly, they can analyse assessments with the most likely misconceptions and knowledge gaps in mind. Mr Jones’ previous work with colleagues, breaking learning down, specifying goals, sequencing ideas and identifying misconceptions should allow him to look for evidence of their knowledge and understanding of the most fundamental and important ideas.\n\n### Deciding on next steps\n\nIn reviewing pupils’ work, Mr Jones must decide whether to revisit an idea or to move on. His decision will reflect the importance of the idea: if a pupil misconception is core to understanding the subject, or to understanding the current topic, it is worth reviewing immediately. If a misconception is peripheral to the subject or the topic, it may not be a priority (Wiliam, 2011). Mr Jones may also be influenced by the prevalence of the misconception or knowledge gap: the more pupils who hold it, the more important it is to address.\n\nHaving identified the prevalence and importance of the knowledge gap or misconception, he can choose how to adapt his teaching and/or how to provide feedback to pupils. For example, if an assessment activity shows him that a handful of pupils have retained a misconception from a previous unit, he may defer addressing it since it is not foundational to the subject or the current unit. Conversely, if pupils have a fundamental misconception, or many pupils have the same knowledge gap, he may offer a fresh explanation, a new learning task and then reassess pupils’ understanding. His mental model of the subject and his sense of pupils’ developing mental models should allow him to prioritise the most crucial barriers to their understanding, drawing on the support of colleagues and resources where necessary.\n\n### Learning and performance are distinct\n\nLearning and performance are different things. Performance is a temporary change in behaviour or knowledge which can be measured immediately after acquisition; learning is a lasting change in behaviour or knowledge (Christodoulou, 2017). Pupils’ responses during or after a lesson that introduced new information are an indication of their performance, not of their learning. For example, pupils may answer correctly initially but subsequently forget new information. In analysing pupils’ responses, Mr Jones prioritises using them to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions, rather than seeing them as a guarantee that pupils will recall key ideas: his plans to revisit key ideas will check and support pupils’ subsequent retention.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nWhatever the process Mr Jones follows, it must be quick. Within a lesson, the process could take a few seconds; after the lesson, he needs to have enough time having examined pupil responses to plan a next step. Equally, it is difficult for teachers new to an idea to identify misconceptions or gaps in pupils’ mental models immediately. Mr Jones may usefully review assessments and decide on next steps in collaboration with his mentor or a more experienced teacher. They can help him decide best what to do next and can model their approach to reviewing assessments.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can reach conclusions about next steps from formative assessment if he:\n<ul>\n  <li>Takes a systematic approach to identify patterns of understanding.</li>\n  <li>\n    Tries to understand pupils’ thinking by seeking common misconceptions and\n    knowledge gaps, rather than just looking for the correct answer.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Judges the prevalence and importance of misconceptions and knowledge gaps\n    when deciding whether and how to adapt his teaching.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBlack, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., & Wiliam, D.

They ask\nlots of questions both during and after the lesson to identify how knowledge is taking\nshape. As well as asking questions, effective teachers do something with the information\nthat they gather. Effective teachers adapt their teaching in response to what they\nfind out. Adapting teaching helps teachers to provide targeted support and is likely\nto increase pupil success.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nAdapting lessons to meet pupils' needs is about using the inferences made from formative\nassessment to make better decisions. Learning is a complex process and pupils need\nlots of support along the way, such as more practice or opportunities to correct\nmisconceptions. Pupils learn more when their teachers know what they've understood\nand adapt their teaching in response.\n\nIn order to adapt lessons to meet their pupils' needs, teachers first need to understand what those needs are. This can occur through effective design and delivery of formative assessment, looking out for particular misconceptions as they circulate, asking carefully targeted questions and examining the pupils' work.\n\nOnce teachers have collected data, there are several ways they can use it. One way is through using whole-class or group feedback. This allows teachers to address common errors or misconceptions for multiple students. Another way teachers might adapt lessons to meet their pupils' needs is through further support. This might be done through additional practice or scaffolding.\n\nSometimes a teacher might decide to adapt teaching in future lessons. Teachers might plan time to respond to common misconceptions or errors. Depending on how important the concept is, a teacher might use the start of a lesson, or in some instances a whole lesson, to explain or reteach concepts to pupils.\n\nPupils' needs will differ across the class. And it can be tough to balance the needs of the whole class and the needs of individuals when adapting teaching. It's important that teachers continue to support pupils individually. This can be done through one-to-one conversations, working effectively with teaching assistants and working closely with the special educational needs coordinator in their school. Many pupils will have preferences about how they learn. However, the idea that tailoring teaching to pupils' preferred learning style will benefit them is not supported by evidence.\n\nPupils are likely to learn at different rates and require different support from their teachers in order to succeed. Carefully planning lessons in advance to help your pupils to access and remember what they learn is essential. The teachers can't always predict what will happen when they teach something. Seeking to understand the differences in pupil learning and responding appropriately is a key part of teaching. This is what adapting teaching is all about. At its best, adapting teaching can ensure teachers target support effectively, both for individuals and groups.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see a model of how to adapt a lesson in response to formative\nassessment information. As you watch, pay particular attention to the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Considers carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and\n    small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different\n    lessons for different groups of pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>Builds in additional practice or removes unnecessary expositions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nIn this example, imagine I will be teaching a class about the process of\nphotosynthesis. Prior to the lesson, I'm going to spend a short amount of time\nthinking about the misconceptions I might encounter and planning how I respond.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the misconceptions I think my pupils might have. I thought about this when planning the lesson and when designing a formative assessment. These are the misconceptions I anticipate.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Plants eat the soil and use it to grow</li>\n  <li>Plants breathe in carbon dioxide</li>\n  <li>Plants don't respire</li>\n</ul>\nSo, next, I need to consider who is likely to hold these misconceptions and how significant\nthey are. I need to ask how many pupils are likely to hold the misconception. One\nor two pupils or perhaps the whole class. Will the misconception get in the way of\nlearning now? Or can I address it later? The answers to these questions will determine\nmy next step.\n\nFinally, I need to think about how I might adapt the lesson, if the misconceptions arise. I have several options that I can choose from, including breaking the content down for pupils further, reteaching something they've got wrong, or coming back to the content in another lesson. All of these options could work for either a whole class, a small group, or an individual.\n\nLet's look at my list of misconceptions one by one. The first potential misconception identified is: plants eat the soil and use it to grow. So this is a legacy misconception that will have been ironed out for many in primary school, but may still persist for a small number of pupils. I've planned to address this in my main exposition when they first meet the topic in key stage three. But we know that this is a common misconception and can be highly persistent. And so, I will make sure to check for evidence of this when I'm circulating during the independent practice task. If pupils are making this mistake, I'm going to break down the content further with them on a one-to-one basis, and get them to look at the word equation for photosynthesis to consider where the different reactants come from. To further support their thinking, I might direct them to think about where all the soil would go if this was the case. However, as it shouldn't be too widespread and is planned into my initial exposition, I don't anticipate that I will need to address this with a whole-class reteach.\n\nThe second misconception pupils might have is: plants breathe in carbon dioxide. From experience, this is a common mistake that comes from pupils' difficulty with the correct term, which is absorb. This piece of tier two vocabulary is abstract, and unfamiliar to pupils. Absorb is a challenging yet important piece of subject-specific vocabulary that pupils need to be confident understanding and using moving forwards in order to succeed in this topic and many others. And if it's not clear, there will be a barrier to future learning. While I explicitly taught the term absorb when introducing photosynthesis, I now want the pupils to recall it and check they haven't confused it with the concept of breathing. Therefore, before moving on to the independent practice, I will use a true or false quiz to check if the class hold this misconception. If they do, I will reteach this key concept to the whole class, by A: explaining that breathing is something that animals do using their lungs and plants don't have lungs, and B: describing how absorb can be used in a variety of contexts. And they will always refer to a substance or chemical being drawn into something.\n\nThe third possible misconception I need to prepare for is: plants only photosynthesize, they don't respire. I think it's likely that a lot of my pupils will hold this misconception. They know the animals respire and now, they are being taught that plants photosynthesize. So, it seems like a natural dichotomy to them. However, it's crucial to note this misconception is not going to prevent them from properly understanding the process of photosynthesis within this lesson. I don't want to allow this misconception to develop and grow unchecked. And so, if it appears in the pupils' work I'll individually correct them briefly; however, I won't spend a great deal of time on it, or reteaching the whole class, as it's not what they are directly learning about at this point. In a future lesson, I have planned to attend to this conflict and dedicate time to explaining it, considering its implications. Pupils will find it easier to engage with the misconception when they know more about the processes of photosynthesis and respiration.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification analysis</h3>\nThere are several important ideas to highlight in this model. First, the coach carefully\nconsiders common misconceptions and mistakes. As they do, they think about how significant\nthe mistake is and which pupils are likely to make it.\n\nNext, they plan how they respond to misconceptions, varying their approach depending on how many pupils it affects, and how significant the issue is.\n\nThroughout the model, the coach considers carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups, would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils.\n\nBy anticipating and planning their response in advance, the coach will be able to adapt more effectively in the moment. They know which problems to address immediately, and which ones to pick up in a subsequent lesson.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've considered the importance of adapting lessons to meet pupil\nneeds, and some of the ways in which teachers might do this. Before we finish, read\nthe key ideas that the video has covered. Which of the following ideas did the example\nillustrate the best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Adapting lessons, while maintaining high expectations for all, so that all\n    pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Considering carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals\n    and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning\n    different lessons for different groups of pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nThere are no perfect solutions when it comes to adapting teaching. But, when\nteachers adapt their teaching effectively, it helps them to target their support\nbetter, so that it addresses pupils' needs. If we do this well, pupils should\nlearn more. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S11.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones is using formative assessment regularly and becoming increasingly skilled in analysing what he learns from it. He is confident he can identify the knowledge gaps and misconceptions pupils face. However, he is uncertain how best to adapt lessons to meet pupils’ needs. Should he create tailored activities and resources for individual pupils? How can he meet pupils’ individual needs efficiently?\n\n## Key idea\n\nTeachers can use information about pupil understanding and needs to target support at the whole class, groups and individuals.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Using information from assessments to adapt lessons\n\nMr Jones designs assessment tasks and analyses the information they provide to allow him to adapt his teaching to meet pupils’ needs. When teachers know what their pupils have understood, and use this information to adapt their teaching, pupils’ achievement increases (Speckesser et al., 2018). Mr Jones should also collect information about pupils' needs and possible strategies, particularly for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, by working closely with colleagues including the SENCo, families and pupils. However, using information on pupil needs to adapt teaching is challenging as it requires teachers to decide how to respond rapidly and there are no perfect solutions. Pupils learn at different rates and require different levels of support. In any class, when seeking to understand pupil differences including levels of prior knowledge and barriers to learning, at any one time some pupils will be ready to move on and others may need further support.\n\n### Learning styles and individualisation will not be effective or sustainable\n\nMr Jones could design a different lesson or task for every pupil, but this would be a mistake. Pupils have distinct learning preferences: some prefer to read, some would rather listen, some might prefer group activities. Mr Jones could try to create distinct activities for different groups. However, no evidence exists that tailoring learning to pupils’ preferred learning styles is effective (Pashler, et al., 2008). The authors of this study were adamant that “limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number” (Pashler, et al., 2008, p.105).\n\nSimilarly, Mr Jones might try to design individual activities around individual pupils’ current knowledge gaps or misconceptions. The problem with this approach is that it requires Mr Jones to spend a huge amount of time planning and setting out activities for individual pupils. It also robs individual pupils of the chance to benefit from the teacher’s expertise by forcing them to overcome their knowledge gaps and misconceptions individually (Sadler, 2010). Mr Jones is more likely to be successful if he prioritises designing tasks to support the whole class or groups within it first. Once the majority are experiencing success, he can then responsively support groups and individuals during the lesson where this is feasible.\n\n### Common tasks and flexible grouping\n\nMr Jones can best meet the needs of individuals by identifying the needs which several pupils have in common. Mr Jones should still build relationships with individuals and seek to support them with specific individual needs, such as seating visually impaired pupils at the front of the class and providing large print resources or providing a story about dinosaurs if he knows this will be particularly motivating for pupils who usually struggle to focus. However, many pupil needs are shared by the rest of the class: many misconceptions are common to pupils learning specific subjects so he can address them simultaneously.\n\nFor example, many pupils use apostrophes unnecessarily for words ending in a plural ‘s’, add the numerators and denominators separately when adding fractions, and believe that air tubes distribute air around the body. Likewise, Mr Jones is likely to find knowledge gaps which are shared among many pupils since they are based on not having been introduced to (or not recalling) past content. While Mr Jones can look for opportunities to work with misconceptions or knowledge gaps held by all pupils, if one individual pupil has a specific need, he can dedicate individual time to them.\n\nHaving identified the need of several pupils, Mr Jones may decide to:\n\n- **Work with the whole class:** Planning new explanations and additional learning tasks for the whole class. This gives him the opportunity to reiterate key ideas and give all pupils additional practice.\n- **Group pupils:** Putting pupils together into small groups based on shared need. For example, all pupils who got question seven wrong or who missed the last lesson. This kind of within-class grouping tends to prove effective and to benefit pupils at all levels (Steenbergen-Hu, et al., 2016). It enables groups of pupils to benefit from more of Mr Jones’s time and expertise as he can explain a misconception or overcome a knowledge gap with all pupils who hold it at once. This also makes it a more efficient way for him to use his time. If an individual pupil has a specific need, perhaps linked to special educational needs or a disability, Mr Jones can devote additional time to them: his grouping of other pupils increases the time he can spend with the individuals who need it most.\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nIn adapting lessons – and particularly when working with small groups with specific misconceptions – Mr Jones should continue to convey his high expectations of pupils (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018).\n\nPupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to need additional levels of support. Mr Jones should seek specific strategies to support these pupils with specific learning barriers where appropriate, such that they can meet these high expectations, e.g. sitting a visually impaired pupil at the front of the class and providing large print resources so that they can complete common class tasks successfully.\n\nTeaching assistants can provide further support but they need to be prepared for the lesson by the teacher and used to supplement, rather than replace, the teacher (EEF, 2018). For example, the TA could support pupils to successfully correct the apostrophes in their work after the teacher has explained correct usage.\n\nAn ongoing dilemma for Mr Jones will be when to review a topic and when to carry on. His work identifying the most important core ideas within a subject and a topic should make it easier for him to prioritise this.\n\nAnother dilemma for Mr Jones is whether to give pupils feedback. As pupils benefit from accessing material several times to learn it (Pashler et al, 2007; Dunlosky et al., 2013), it will often be more efficient to use strategies like modelling content, not least as written feedback adds to teacher workload leading to learning gains, especially if it is not acted upon (Gibson et al, 2015; EEF, 2016).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nIn considering how to adapt his teaching to meet pupils’ needs, Mr Jones needs to\nknow that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The value of formative assessment is in allowing teachers to understand and\n    respond to pupil needs.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Targeting learning styles is ineffective and individualised tasks for all\n    pupils are prohibitively time-consuming.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Adaptations should focus on the misconceptions and knowledge gaps\n    identified, particularly when they are common to many pupils.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nBlack, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., & Wiliam, D.

Teachers need to think carefully about what feedback\nthey'll provide and why. Feedback can show pupils how to improve on a specific task\nand develop their understanding of the subject. When teachers give effective feedback,\npupils learn more.\n<h3>Presenter main</h3>\nEffective feedback focuses on how pupils can improve. It provides them with clear\nguidance on what they can do to develop their knowledge and understanding of a subject.\nUltimately, we want pupils to be successful without the support of a teacher. We\nwant pupils to go from dependence to independence. Feedback can help.\n\nYou need to think carefully about how you design and deliver feedback. Feedback should be specific. It should focus on specific actions that pupils can understand and use. Specific feedback can also be more manageable for both pupils and teachers. Lengthy written feedback can be difficult for pupils to read, and it takes teachers a lot of time to create. Feedback that's short and precise can be better for both pupils and teachers.\n\nFeedback also needs to support pupils to improve in future learning. It's a good idea to design feedback that's linked to both the specific task in hand and a more general concept that pupils will encounter on a different task.\n\nA lot of the feedback that teachers give will be specific to a task. For example, they may say you need to rewrite your answer to question three, remove the brackets by multiplying by two. This will help pupils to address a specific mistake in a specific task, but they might not remember to apply this feedback the next time that they're simplifying equations. Transfer from one context to another is hard, even when the problems are very similar. On the other hand, a teacher might give more general feedback like, remember to write formally in business letters. This is a strategy that they can apply beyond this task. However, it might not tell them which specific area they need to correct such as removing abbreviations like it's. Therefore, feedback that combines a specific action that they can apply to the task in hand, along with a more general approach that they can apply to similar types of problems, can help.\n\nIn order to design feedback that is both specific and general, teachers can ask themselves a number of key questions. First, what's the specific mistake that pupils have made on this task? Second, what underlying concept is this mistake linked to? And third, can I design feedback that improves both the specific task and their understanding of the underlying concept?\n\nAn example of this might be where pupils have made a mistake when writing formal prose. Take a look at this example of a pupil's work. The specific error is that they've used the contraction \"thanks\" instead of \"thank you.\" The underlying concept that this mistake is linked to is that they should use formal writing for business letters. And that formal writing has a number of conventions, including the avoidance of contractions. Feedback that improves this task and pupil understanding of the underlying concept might look like this. <em>\"Do not use the contraction thanks. Use full words in formal writing to sound more precise\".</em> Here, the feedback gives the pupil something specific to correct, but it also reminds them of the more general underlying concept of formal writing. When they write another formal letter, this may help them to remember to avoid the use of contractions.\n\nThere may of course be times when specific direct feedback that focuses solely on the task in hand is appropriate. This will depend on the content and the learner. For example, when pupils are in the early stages of learning about the column subtraction method, it's useful to focus feedback on this specific strategy first. Pupils will need to know the specific concrete steps for this method first, before teachers start to link it to more abstract principles such as commutative property.\n\nAnother way of designing usable feedback is to design feedback that helps pupils to regulate their own learning. We want the feedback that we give pupils to improve future work, without continued teacher support. Teachers can provide feedback which encourages students to use a self-regulatory strategy such as plan, monitor, and evaluate. For example, a teacher might revisit the plan stage by showing them what good looks like, going through a good example of the column method again, drawing attention to the importance of borrowing one from the left. The teacher could then recall the monitor and evaluate strategies by comparing this example to the pupil's work, highlighting where they went wrong and identifying the steps they need to take to improve their work. Feedback demonstrating this approach could encourage them to plan, monitor, and evaluate when they work on their own.\n\nIn terms of delivering feedback it's important to be aware that pupils' responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors. Feedback needs to feel encouraging. Teachers can help to ensure that feedback will be received well by ensuring that they have solid foundations in place: a positive learning environment and a culture of mutual trust and respect between pupils and teachers. It also helps to explain why feedback is being given, reminding pupils that the purpose is to help them to achieve ambitious learning goals. Effective feedback can help pupils get better and should feel encouraging as a result. Equally, focusing on the work itself rather than the pupils' personal strengths and weaknesses can make pupils more receptive to feedback and more likely to act on it. Instead of saying something like, <em>\"You're normally great at writing, what's going on here?\"</em> more specific feedback about the work would be more useful:<em> \"Before you write a sentence down, practice saying it in your head first.\" </em>\n\nWith a better understanding of where pupils have gone wrong and why, and what feedback will help them to improve, you can go back and refine your approach to how you might deliver that feedback. That might mean a quick correction, reteaching, more time to practice, or perhaps a combination of all three.\n\n<h3>Presenter exemplification framing</h3>\nIn the next example, you'll see a model of preparing feedback for the whole class.\nAs you watch, focus on the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Prioritises the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings rather\n    than careless mistakes when marking\n  </li>\n  <li>Focuses on specific actions for pupils</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exemplification: Ambition Institute coach</h3>\nFor the purpose of this model, I want you to imagine that I am an English\nteacher. My year seven class have been writing short stories for creative\nwriting. Understanding how to create appropriate and effective metaphors in\ncreative writing is a key skill at teaching English. And I want my pupils to\nmaster it as part of the key stage three English curriculum.\n\nPart of the success criteria that I set for the short story was to use at least three metaphors as comparative figures of speech within their writing.\n\nI have read my pupils' short stories, and one common misunderstanding I found is that the pupils are using similes instead of metaphors. Similes and metaphors are often confused with one another. A key difference between a simile and a metaphor is that a simile uses the words \"like\" or \"as\" to compare two different things in an interesting way, while a metaphor simply states the comparison without using \"like\" or \"as\". I want to make sure that my feedback helps them to improve on this task and similar upcoming tasks. So I'm going to ask myself a number of steps when planning my feedback.\n\nNumber one, what is the problem? Pupils are not using metaphors in their creative writing tasks. And in some instances are using similes instead.\n\nNumber two, what is an underlying concept which needs to be addressed? Understanding that metaphors can help make writing more vivid and concise.\n\nNumber three, what specific feedback can I give to address the error on this task? Identify where they can change a simile to a metaphor.\n\nNumber four, what feedback can I give about the underlying concept? Reminding pupils about the effect of using a metaphor.\n\n<em>\n  “Right year seven, I've read through your short stories and I have to say, I\n  was really impressed with how original some of the writing was. One thing that\n  I think that we could improve is our use of metaphors to create a really clear\n  image in our reader's imagination. I did set this as one of our key criteria.\n  And so we need to work on this a little bit more to make sure that we all get\n  it right.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Remember, a metaphor is when we use one thing to describe another. We're\n  making that comparison. An example would be, the girl was a rose amongst the\n  thorns. Here, the rose is being used to describe the girl. Suggesting that\n  they have some of the same qualities like being beautiful, but also\n  potentially causing harm. This one metaphor should create a really vivid image\n  in our reader's imagination, without using that many words.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  I noticed that some of you used similes in your writing. Remember a simile is\n  when we use \"like\" or \"as\" to compare two different things in an interesting\n  way. An example of that would be, the girl was as sweet as a rose. A metaphor\n  is different from a simile because a metaphor simply states the comparison\n  without using \"like\" or \"as\". Using metaphors in our writing is a really\n  concise way of creating a powerful image in our reader's imagination, often in\n  just a few words.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  Right. Now I'm going to give you 10 minutes to complete the following task.\n</em>\n\n<em>Step one, read through your story. </em>\n\n<em>\n  Step two, identify a simile that you've used and turn it into a metaphor, to\n  create a powerful image more quickly.{\" \"}\n</em>\n\n<em>\n  So an example would be the simile, she danced like she was floating on air,\n  turned into the metaphor, she floated on air when she danced.”\n</em>\n\nLet's unpick this model. First, I prioritised my feedback on an important misunderstanding: the difference between similes and a metaphor, and the different impact they can have in creative writing. Pupils had made other errors too, like spelling errors, but I have a strategy in place that will support pupils to correct these themselves. I want to make sure that the feedback I'm providing to the whole class will help the majority of my pupils improve their work. This helps me to make the best use of my time and theirs.\n\nSecond, I designed my feedback carefully so that it focused on specific actions. As well as this, by linking the feedback to an underlying concept, I was drawing attention to the underlying structure of the problem. In this case, understanding the different impact that metaphors and similes can have in creative writing. This should help my pupils to correct their own work when they do similar tasks in the future.\n\nAnd finally, I designed my feedback so that it was delivered verbally. This saves me a lot of time, as I'm not writing individual comments on my pupils' work. During the lesson, I will be able to check that pupils understand the feedback by checking how they act on it.\n\n<h3>Presenter key ideas</h3>\nIn this video, we've considered the impact that effective feedback can have, as well\nas some ideas about what to include in feedback. Before you finish, take a moment\nto read over the key ideas of the video. Which ideas do you think the model illustrated\nthe best?\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Prioritise the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather\n    than careless mistakes when marking\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for them to respond to\n    feedback\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Use verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after\n    lessons where possible\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Presenter summary</h3>\nFeedback is something that teachers are likely to improve on the more that they\nknow their subject and their pupils. When feedback is successful, pupils do\nbetter academically and take increasing ownership over their learning, both at\nschool and beyond. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n{button secondary}[Download this module (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ambition/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/EarlyCareerTeachers_2020_TeacherHandbook_S12.pdf){/button}\n\n## Teaching challenge\n\nMr Jones assesses pupils’ work regularly and adapts his teaching in response to their needs. He wants to ensure that the feedback he offers pupils genuinely helps them to improve their work and deepen their understanding. He finds the variety of kinds of feedback available overwhelming and he worries that the amount of time it will take him to provide detailed feedback will be unsustainable in the long term.\n\n## Key idea\n\nFeedback can make a significant difference to pupils’ understanding and outcomes if it guides pupils to improve and is sustainable for the teacher.\n\n## Evidence summary\n\n### Effective feedback is specific, usable and encouraging\n\nMr Jones must ensure that his feedback offers pupils precise guidance about how they can improve. Often feedback focuses on the immediate task, but it is more helpful to link feedback about the immediate task to feedback about the subject or the process of learning. This ensures that pupils can apply it to future tasks (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Feedback should provide specific guidance in how pupils improve their work: lengthy, complicated and excessively detailed feedback can be overwhelming to pupils and therefore counter-productive since they may be unable to act upon it (DFE, 2016).\n\nEnsuring pupils respond to feedback is as important as the content of the feedback (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Feedback may be ineffective if pupils find it discouraging or conclude that they are unable to act upon it (Wiliam, 2011). For example, pupils’ responses to feedback can also vary depending on a range of social factors, including their age as well as the message the feedback contains. Realising this, Mr Jones needs to frame feedback in such a way as to ensure that pupils seek and welcome it, for example identifying specific strengths and encouraging pupils to keep up their effort in relation to these. Moreover, feedback should focus on improving pupils’ work, for example “remember to write formally in business letters: check and remove any abbreviations in formal writing”. In contrast, if it focuses on pupils’ personal strengths and weaknesses (“you’re usually good at writing letters”), this can lead them to worry more about how they are perceived by others than about how they can improve (Hattie and Timperley, 2007). He also needs to give them time and opportunities to act upon formative feedback, for example in the lesson after written feedback has been given.\n\nGiven the importance of these elements of feedback, Mr Jones realises he will need to be careful about his use of peer and self-generated feedback. If these strategies are to be effective, they need to meet the same criteria as any other feedback: offer specific guidance and encourage further effort. If they do not, they are likely to be ineffective.\n\nIn summary, feedback should:\n\n- Be specific.\n- Focus on immediate and subsequent improvements in work and effort.\n- Encourage pupils to act upon it.\n\n### Feedback needs to be sustainable for teachers\n\nMr Jones worries that providing detailed feedback could easily come to take up a huge amount of his time. He is reassured to learn that there is no specific evidence supporting the provision of extensive written feedback and very limited evidence about the effectiveness of written marking as a specific means of providing feedback (Gibson et al., 2015). Within the limits of his school’s marking and feedback policy, this frees him to provide the guidance that pupils need in the most efficient manner possible. He could work with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to feedback, for example, by giving pupils feedback through a model, through a verbal comment, or by providing feedback to the whole class. He should only record data from feedback when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes.\n\n### Feedback and self-regulation\n\nFeedback can help pupils to take a greater role in their learning. Feedback allows pupils to better plan, monitor and evaluate their current performance and understanding. If pupils have a good grasp of their current performance and a clear sense of their goal, then they should increasingly be able to judge how well they are doing and regulate their learning by identifying what they need to do to improve.\n\nTeachers can help by explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge – for example, by helping pupils to effectively plan, monitor and evaluate their writing through sharing what an effective final piece of writing looks like and modelling the thinking and steps undertaken to produce it. Teachers can then facilitate feedback on how effectively pupils have planned, monitored and evaluated their work: “You missed out step two in the plan. Make sure you select three pieces of evidence you are going to use in your essay”. This feedback develops pupil metacognition in relation to this particular task. These strategies can develop pupil independence and academic success (EEF, 2017).\n\n### Nuances and caveats\n\nNot all feedback is effective. Additional feedback may not support pupils to improve further: the crucial question when considering whether feedback is effective is whether it leads to the desired improvement. It is not about the quantity offered or the way it is delivered.\n\nFeedback is just one way to help pupils improve: the priority is to teach effectively initially then to use feedback where pupils have struggled, rather than relying on feedback (Hattie and Timperley, 2007).\n\nThe evidence on feedback is sometimes inconclusive and even contradictory (Kluger & de Nisi, 1996). Mr Jones will need to adapt the guidance on effective feedback to suit the subject he is teaching and the needs of his class. It could be useful to speak to colleagues who teach the same subject about such adaptions.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key takeaways</h3>\nMr Jones can help pupils to improve their work and deepen their understanding by:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Offering feedback which guides pupils on how to improve and gives them the\n    opportunity to apply it.\n  </li>\n  <li>Making his approach to feedback efficient and sustainable for him.</li>\n  <li>Encouraging pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### Further reading\n\nDepartment for Education.

Welcome to Block 1. Block 1 is about creating an effective climate for\n  learning for your pupils.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It is natural for behaviour management to preoccupy new teachers. Poor\n  behaviour makes it hard for pupils to learn. As a teacher, the feeling of not\n  being in charge of the lesson can be really demoralising. You will inevitably\n  contrast what you do with more experienced colleagues, but it can be hard to\n  identify the strategies they use to develop a positive climate for learning.\n  It can be easy to assume that you either have ‘it’ or you don’t. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The good news is that this doesn’t need to be the case! A positive learning\n  environment is carefully crafted through specific teacher planning and\n  actions, and everyone can do this. In short, you need to teach your pupils how\n  to behave in your classroom, setting clear expectations and reinforcing these\n  with consistent routines. Over time, this will help pupils understand how to\n  take responsibility for their behaviour, through self-regulation, monitoring\n  their own actions, and making the right choices. In this type of environment,\n  pupils will feel more supported and secure, and you will be happier in your\n  job.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  When you know what to look for, you will see two different aspects of\n  behaviour management. One is the multi-faceted skill of dealing effectively\n  with instances of misbehaviour. This is a skill which improves with\n  experience, but it’s also something that is dependent on knowing your pupils\n  well as individuals. The second, more desirable, aspect is the proactive\n  orchestration of classroom conditions in which poor behaviour is less likely\n  to happen. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  To help with this, your goal should be to develop positive relationships and a\n  culture of respect and trust with your pupils. Get to know your pupils, learn\n  their names, talk to them about how they are learning and tell them what you\n  expect of them. Give them the chance to learn how to behave well, and model\n  this yourself. Your school will have policies and practices to support you and\n  these should be followed from the outset. However, systems and policies alone\n  cannot create a positive learning environment. Your actions,{\" \"}\n</span>\n<i>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your</span>\n</i>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  behaviour and how you respond to your pupils are key. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  teachers we remember the most are those who were fair and consistent in how\n  they treated us. They are also the ones we knew had high expectations of both\n  our behaviour and what we could achieve. They inspired us to do more, do\n  better and produce our best. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  You are responsible for creating and managing the climate within your\n  classroom. Your actions can influence the way your pupils behave, the way that\n  they feel about your lessons and the results they achieve. This Block has been\n  designed to support you in securing the kind of positive climate for learning\n  which will have a direct impact on your teaching and your pupils’ learning.

It is likely to include positive pupils who are motivated to learn and who do not misbehave. This dream can be a reality. Through your direct actions and behaviours as the teacher you have the ability to influence all of this.\n\nBehaviour management can be one of the most challenging parts of teaching for all teachers and it might well be something you are feeling worried about. Learning how to manage behaviour effectively makes a big difference to pupils’ learning, contributes to improved outcomes and will make you feel significantly happier about your role (Education Endowment Foundation, 2019). It also significantly improves pupil wellbeing in the classroom. Children who are calm and secure in their surroundings are more likely to learn; it is our job as teachers to ensure that our classrooms provide this environment. All teachers, no matter what stage of their career they are at, need to keep developing their skills in managing behaviour.\n\n## Establishing and reinforcing routines creates a positive climate for learning\n\nThe research in this area is clear. Classroom climate and management are key to maximising the learning that can take place (Coe et al., 2014). Not surprisingly, the choices teachers make about how they manage their classroom can have a significant, positive effect on reducing misbehaviour (Valdebenito et al., 2018). Establishing the learning environment plays an important role in pupil engagement (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). In particular, showing our pupils what is expected of them through routines promotes good behaviour (Institute of Education Sciences, 2008; Education Endowment Foundation, 2019).\n\nIt can be motivating for pupils to know what is expected from them. The vast majority of pupils want to do well and will be motivated to meet your expectations. When it is made clear what is expected, they will know how they should behave. We can help our pupils with this through establishing routines for the everyday things that happen in our lessons.\n\n$I\nRoutines can be used for most common classroom activities, such as:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Entering the classroom</li>\n  <li>Starts and ends of lessons</li>\n  <li>Starting and finishing work</li>\n  <li>Transitions between activities or places in the learning environment</li>\n  <li>Taking out and putting away resources</li>\n  <li>Whole-class teaching and discussion</li>\n  <li>Handing out equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nMaking your pupils feel safe and secure is an important part of teaching and also improves pupil wellbeing. Classrooms should be predictable environments with clear rules, routines and expectations about behaviour as well as learning, which offer all pupils opportunities for success (Kern & Clemens, 2007; Rosenshine, 2012). Teachers should set high standards for behaviour as well as for learning and believe that their pupils can meet these standards (Willingham, 2009). When you establish a calm, purposeful learning environment, pupils will:\n\n- Be more likely to behave well\n- Be able to concentrate and therefore learn\n- Be motivated to learn\n- Have increased wellbeing\n- Feel secure enough to take risks and show you their thinking (see Block 2).\n\nRoutines, by definition, need to happen in the same way every time, making your classroom a predictable and safe place; pupils will know where they stand and what you expect from them.\n\nWhat do more experienced teachers do to establish and maintain these routines? The table below shows three key strategies:\n\n| Strategy                          | How it is effective                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                             |\n| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Explicit instructions             | Tells pupils exactly what you expect to see and means expectations cannot be misinterpreted.                                  | “When you come into the classroom, I expect each person to be silent. That means no one will talk.” |\n| Reminders                         | Reminding pupils of rules and routines means that they will be reinforced, and pupils are more likely to remember what to do. | “I need all eyes on me and conversations finished by the time I have counted down to 1. 3,2,1.”     |\n| Consistent modelling of behaviour | Modelling the behaviour you expect to see shows pupils what you want from them and makes this explicit.                       | “Pens down (puts pen down) and looking this way without talking (hand to lips).”                    |\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Why are routines important for improving classroom behaviour?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which of these statements is NOT true?\n    </span>\n    <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Routines show pupils what is expected of them, so they know how to\n          behave.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Routines force pupils to comply with the school culture.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Routines create a predictable classroom environment for pupils. \n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Routines lead to a calm and predictable environment, which is\n          conducive to learning.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      When can we use routines in our teaching?\n    </span>\n    <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Just at the end and beginning of lessons.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          When completing complicated tasks.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          For most common classroom activities.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When behaviour is poor.</span>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Name three methods that experienced teachers use to establish and maintain\n      routines.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nAnother way we can strengthen and embed our routines is through positive reinforcement. Positively reinforcing what we want to see reduces poor behaviour and helps increase academic engagement (Institute of Education Sciences, 2008). It is also motivating and supports pupil wellbeing. When we praise and give attention to the specific behaviour we want to see, it increases the likelihood of that behaviour happening again. It will also encourage other pupils to follow suit. The same is true in reverse: if a pupil continuously calls out and the teacher responds to them, they are receiving attention for that behaviour and are likely to repeat it. Positive reinforcement should be used strategically to nurture the behaviour we _want_ to see.\n\nThis table shows three ways positive reinforcement can support routines and good behaviour:\n\n| Strategy                                                         | How it is effective                                                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tell/show pupils what behaviour you expect and why.              | Behaviour may suggest that the pupil does not know what behaviour is expected of them.

Am I following instructions? Am I on task? Did I ask for help in the right way? |\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Think about a recent lesson: what behaviours do you give attention to in\n      the classroom?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How could you use positive reinforcement to support your routines and the\n      behaviour you want to see?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nRoutines need to be actively taught and reinforced frequently, with reasons, so that pupils understand what is expected of them (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). In Activity 1.3, we look at how teachers can establish effective routines. Pupils should recognise routines as the ‘norms’ of the classroom. If you have effective routines, pupils will follow them consistently and efficiently, maximising time for learning.\n\n## 1.2b\n\n### Time allocation\n\n60 minutes with 1.2a\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Read the information and look at the examples provided.\n- As you do this, make notes in response to the key questions below.\n- You will need to take the notes with you to your mentor session for discussion with your mentor.\n\n| Learn that                                                                                                                 |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1.1 Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.               |\n| 1.2 Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.                  |\n| 1.3 Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.          |\n| 1.4 Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.               |\n| 1.5 A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships.                                                |\n| 7. 5 Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood. |\n\n| Learn how to                                                                        |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:**            |\n| 7g Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. |\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key questions</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What can you do to build positive relationships with your pupils?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How would you define a culture of respect and trust in your classroom?\n      What does a classroom that has this culture look like?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$I\n\nIn the first section of this activity, we looked at using rules and routines to support an effective climate for learning. In part b we take a closer look at how our relationships with pupils and our expectations of them can have a direct impact on behaviour and the learning environment in our classroom.\n\n## Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture\n\nTo create a calm, purposeful classroom environment, it is key to focus on the positive behaviours you expect (Coe et al., 2014). You can do this through:\n\n- Conveying clear expectations (“this is how we do things here”)\n- Giving precise instructions about what is expected.\n\nThis clarity of expectations is essential to securing good behaviour from your pupils. In communicating these standards, we also need to explain in detail how pupils are expected to meet them. Experienced teachers will do this explicitly, early on with every new class and continue to reinforce their expectations all the time. They also lead by example, role-modelling the behaviours they expect from pupils.\n\nLook at the cartoon below which highlights this.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The image shows two classroom scenes: &lt;p>&lt;/p>One is chaotic, with the heading ‘Avoid this’, while the other is calm, with the heading ‘Try this’.&lt;p>&lt;/p>In the chaotic classroom, the pupils are distracted and misbehaving.

Teachers can use both verbal and non-verbal prompts to communicate their expectations of behaviour to the pupils. It is also important that you give pupils an opportunity to adjust their behaviour before escalating things.\n\n| Verbal prompts                                                                                                              | Non-verbal prompts                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| - Instructions - Praise - Saying “Thank you” - Reinforcement - Giving pupils choices - Reminders of school behaviour policy | - Smiling or frowning - Nodding or shaking head - Eye contact - Hand signals like thumbs up - Position in the room - Silent speaking – mouthing “thank you” or “no” to a pupil - Turning a pupil’s book to the right page |\n\nWhile pupils should have a clear understanding of our general expectations for their behaviour, this should be reinforced for specific activities. When giving task instructions we need to make it clear to pupils what we want them to do and the behaviour we expect to see as they complete the task. Being crystal clear about our expectations will support our pupils in knowing exactly what to do.\n\nWhen explaining a task, you should:\n\n- Provide clear instructions to complete it\n- Provide clear expectations for behaviour, for example that the task should be completed in silence or in pairs etc.\n\nOnce you have given instructions:\n\n- Visibly scan the room to check who is following your instructions\n- Praise pupils who have begun the task\n- Verbally remind anyone who is speaking that the task is to be completed in silence\n- Use non-verbal signals to encourage slow starters to begin.\n\nWatch the video to see this in practice.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nGiving instructions and checking understanding\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom footage\n\n### Short description\n\nIn the classroom, a teacher gives pupils short and clear instructions to complete a task, then in various ways checks that pupils have understood the instructions.\n\n### Guidance\n\nIt is important that we tell pupils our behavioural expectations when they complete a task.

Part of that is checking that pupils have understood your instructions.\n\nYou can do this by praising those who follow your instructions. And you can offer polite but firm reminders to pupils who do not follow your instructions.\n\nRemember that in addition to what you say, non-verbal communication can be very effective. Holding a finger to your lips may be just as effective as telling people to be quiet.\n\nCLASSROOM INTERACTION\n\nWe are going to look back at the persuasive leaflets we wrote in the last lesson and check that we have used all of the key features of persuasive texts.\n\nMake a note of any features you have not used.\n\nSelect one feature that you have used effectively and write a sentence or two explaining why you think it is effective.\n\nI want you to open your books and spend five minutes doing this in silence.\n\n[Teacher scans the room to check who is following instructions]\n\nAmar, I can see you have started already and so have several others – well done.\n\nHolly, we are working in silence, thank you.\n\nTom… [Tom is standing up and teacher gestures with her arm for him to sit down and begin, which he does]\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>What does the teacher in the video say?</li>\n  <li>What does the teacher do?</li>\n  <li>How do they make their expectations clear?</li>\n  <li>What is the impact of this?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes\n\nWe know that our beliefs can be very influential. What you believe your pupils to be capable of achieving will directly influence what they actually achieve (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). The Pygmalion or ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ research (Rosenthal et al.) in the 1960s showed that when teachers (but not their pupils) were told by researchers that a random group of their pupils had achieved high scores on an aptitude test, these pupils did better over the course of the year than the ‘ordinary’ pupils in their classes. In reality, the test was made up. Not knowing this, the teachers were shown to ask more questions, give more thinking time and provide more feedback to the pupils they believed to be more able. Clearly what you think of your pupils’ abilities and how you plan to meet their needs matters hugely. The higher the expectations you have of your pupils, the more you will push and challenge them and the more their outcomes will improve (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018).\n\nIt is important that you hold high expectations of all your pupils and convey these clearly and consistently through the challenge you provide for them. Show each individual pupil that you believe they can succeed. If you expect too little of a pupil, it is likely that they will be under-challenged and consequently not achieve as much.\n\nTaking specific actions to ensure that you treat all pupils as individuals and showing them that you have high expectations of them is important. The list below shows some of the ways you can do this:\n\n- Give all pupils the same amount of time to answer questions.\n- Positively reinforce answers from all pupils.\n- Give all pupils the same opportunities to engage in the lesson.\n- Move seating plans around often and keep these purposeful.\n- Give pupils the same opportunities for feedback.\n\nThe way a pupil views their own ability will be affected by your expectations of them. Self-perceptions are often seen as precursors to motivation: if a child believes in their ability, they are likely to be more motivated and put forth greater effort, leading to improved performance (Education Endowment Foundation, 2019). We will see in future Blocks that part of this is giving children a chance to succeed and experience success.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you should have low expectations. You should set learning goals that will challenge your pupils. They should have a level of difficulty that only makes them achievable with sustained effort. You can support your pupils to achieve these by demonstrating your high expectations of them; show pupils that you believe in them and their abilities. We can support and develop pupil attitude towards challenge (Willingham, 2009). Pupils must be encouraged to persevere, even when they find work challenging, as it is this process that will help them learn. The level of challenge will convey your high expectations to your pupils and when they achieve success in meeting those high expectations they will be motivated to work harder and strive to achieve further success (Chapman et al., 2013; Rathmann et al., 2018).\n\n| Strategies to try                                                                | What this looks like in practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Set challenging goals for your pupils.                                           | - Model to pupils how to set a specific long-term goal, by sharing your own. - Demonstrate how goals should be actionable. - Sensitively increase or decrease the challenge and aspiration of pupils’ goals. - Support pupils in setting a timeline and a method of recording progress. - Teach pupils the rationale behind setting their own goals.

If I want to get better at something, I know that I need to practise that skill. For example, I really want to learn how to bake bread, so I am going to have a go at doing that every weekend. Would practice help you here?\n\nPupil: Hmm yes, I think so.\n\nTeacher: Well we know that regular practice is the best way to improve. How often could you practise reading?\n\nPupil: Well I don’t really like reading.\n\nTeacher: I am really impressed that you have chosen that as something you want to get better at then. You have chosen a challenging goal for yourself, which is the best way to help yourself improve. How will this help you with your schoolwork?\n\nPupil: I think it would help me in English because I would find the work easier.\n\nTeacher: I think improving your reading would support you in all of your subjects and even outside school as well. We can talk about that a bit more in a minute. Let’s think about how you can achieve this. How about starting with just a short amount of reading each day?\n\nPupil: I guess I could read for a bit in the evenings?\n\nTeacher: How about we say 10 minutes reading to start?\n\nPupil: I could do that.\n\nTeacher: How are we going to record your progress?\n\nPupil: I could write in my reading log?\n\nTeacher: That would be great! So, what’s the goal?\n\nPupil: I am going to practise reading every evening for 10 minutes.\n\nTeacher: Great. Should we check in again next week and see how you are getting on?\n\nPupil: Yes, that sounds good.\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>How does the teacher support the pupil to set a challenging goal?</li>\n  <li>What sort of language does the teacher use to show high expectations?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Effective relationships are integral to a positive classroom environment\n\nBuilding positive relationships with the classes and individual pupils you teach is of the utmost importance to both you and your pupils. One of the largest potential mediators of academic outcomes is the extent to which students are motivated and engaged by their interactions with teachers (Allen et al., 2011; Wubbels et al., 2014; PISA, 2015; Valdebenito et al., 2018). When pupils have good relations with their teachers, both their performance and their sense of belonging at school benefit (PISA, 2015). Positive teacher-pupil relations are also associated with higher life satisfaction (Rathmann K et al., 2018) and they can also support the attitudes, behaviours and strategies that facilitate success in school and workplace, such as motivation, perseverance and self-control (EEF, 2019). Secure and positive relationships will also have an impact on the way you feel about your classes and on your own wellbeing. Pupils who want to behave in your lessons will strive to achieve their best and will be motivated and engaged in their learning.\n\nTo make a positive start, teachers need to get to know the pupils they teach, for example by using their names and modelling the respectful attitude they expect in return (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017).\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nLearning everyone's name\n\n### Video type\n\nTalking head\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher explains to the viewer techniques they use to quickly remember pupils' names.\n\n### Guidance\n\nListen to the strategies the teacher uses to learn names quickly and consider what the impact of each one would be.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/4SYNHvXhubk)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nOne of the first things you can do to create a positive relationship with your pupils in a new class is to address them by name so that they feel respected and included.\n\nOf course, in order to do that, you need to learn and remember their names, which can be challenging. Here are a few techniques I use to make sure I learn my pupils’ names as quickly as possible:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    In the first lesson, I ask pupils to tell me something about themselves to\n    give me a sense of who they are. This works best if I refer to that piece of\n    information when I next address them by name.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    In the first few lessons, I ask each pupil to display a name card on their\n    desk so that I can use their names every time I speak to them, from the\n    first minute of the first lesson.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    I make sure I look at pupils’ faces when I speak to them to help establish\n    an association between names and faces.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    I use a fixed seating plan because I find that knowing where in the room to\n    expect a name and a face to be serves as a helpful memory aid.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nThose are the techniques I find helpful but of course there are others. The important\nthing is not to leave it to chance, but to plan how you are going to make it easy\nfor yourself to remember pupils’ names. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>What is the impact of learning names quickly?</li>\n  <li>What strategies does the teacher use to learn pupils’ names quickly?</li>\n  <li>Which do you already use?</li>\n  <li>Are there any strategies you could lift and use in your practice?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nWhile knowing the name of each pupil is a good start, it is clearly not enough! Every interaction you have with your pupils is important as it is these interactions that build relationships. Pupils spend about a third of their waking hours in school during most weeks in the year (PISA, 2015), which means that teachers can become key role models within their pupils’ lives (Johnson et al., 2016) and help pupils form ideas about what it means to be ‘a good person’. This is clearly an important responsibility; you are probably asking yourself how you can best go about it.\n\nStudies show that pupils notice and consider the following things:\n\n- How well they are treated by their teacher\n- How well their teacher treats others\n- How well they get on with their teacher\n- The behaviour the teacher models.\n\n(Lerner & Lerner, 2016)\n\nIt is particularly important that you respond quickly to any instances of bullying or threats to emotional safety of pupils in your class. Showing that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated and being clear on the consequences by following your school behaviour policy will help to build pupil trust in you and models your high expectations for behaviour.\n\nThe following table shares some of the ways you can build and maintain a culture of trust and respect with your pupils. Read through the suggestions and answer the questions that follow.\n\n| Strategies to use                                                             | Putting them into practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Learn names quickly.                                                          | - Use name cards at the beginning of term. - Use a seating plan and refer to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Treat pupils with respect.                                                    | - Be polite in interactions with pupils. - Avoid using sarcasm or humour at pupils’ expense. - Deal with issues individually and privately when possible (see the section on behaviour).                                                                                                 |\n| Get to know pupils as individuals.                                            | - Talk to pupils. - Talk to colleagues. - Talk to their families and carers. - Take an interest in what pupils tell you about their lives. - Be attentive. - Take an interest in pupils’ extra-curricular activities when appropriate.                                                   |\n| Support pupils and show them that they are listened to.                       | - Deal with problem behaviour when it arises (see the section on behaviour). - Notice when pupils seem upset or disengaged and take a moment, at an appropriate time, to talk to them.                                                                                                   |\n| Know who to contact with any safeguarding concerns.                           | - Find out who the safeguarding lead in your school is. - Familiarise yourself with your school’s safeguarding policy.                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Demonstrate a love of learning.                                               | - Be enthusiastic about the content you are teaching. - Tell your pupils why you love the subject or topic they are learning.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Involve all pupils in lessons.                                                | - Ask questions to all pupils. - Try to ensure every pupil has spoken in your lesson at least once (this can be answering a question to you when you circulate, answering a question in front of the class, offering a suggestion when asked, or any other form of appropriate talking). |\n| Respond consistently to pupil behaviour.                                      | - Always follow the rules and routines you have established. - Treat all pupils equally. - Always be consistent. - Always follow through on rewards/sanctions.                                                                                                                           |\n| Respond quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. | - Deal quickly and firmly with any incidents of bullying. - Refer behaviour to relevant members of staff. - Follow the school behaviour policy.                                                                                                                                          |\n| Be positive.                                                                  | - Start each lesson in a positive way. - Give meaningful praise often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    What are three positive impacts of having good relationships with pupils?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Which strategies do you feel that you already use successfully?

Everybody has routines and we all recognise how disconcerting it can be when these routines are broken. We also know how hard it is to change bad routines once they have set in! The same goes for classrooms. Classroom routines ensure that frequently performed tasks are carried out correctly, consistently and efficiently. Routines represent predictability and security, which help pupils feel safe and confident. It is important to teach and embed _good_ routines as soon as you have a new class. Ideally the routine will become habitual and for this to happen, we need it to become normal and expected in our classrooms.\n\nWatch the video of a teacher talking about how they establish their routines with each new class at the start of the year and answer the questions.\n\n## Video\n\n### **Title**\n\nEstablishing routines with new classes\n\n### **Video type**\n\nTalking head\n\n### Short description\n\nTeacher talking about how they establish their routines with each new class at the start of the year.\n\n### Guidance\n\n- What does the teacher do before they teach the routines?\n- How do they teach the routines?

So, the school policy says that all pupils should line up outside the classroom before lessons start?\n\nTeacher: Yes. But I would like to have my pupils starting their work quickly.\n\nMentor: It is really important that all teachers follow the policy. This doesn’t mean you have to change your expectations though. I can tell you want to get pupils started on their work quickly to make sure that you make the most of learning time. Let’s have a think about how you can make the policy work for you.\n\nTeacher: I guess I could be at the door to greet pupils and send them in to get started when they are all lined up?\n\nMentor: I think that would be a great start. You will be making sure that pupils follow school policy, you have a calm, controlled start to the lesson and then get pupils working as quickly as possible. How are you going to make sure pupils follow this routine?\n\nTeacher: I will explain to them what the routine is and then get them to have a go at coming in and getting started straightaway.\n\nMentor: Yes, good idea. It is always good to explicitly teach your routine to your class. Can you explain to them why you want them to get started straightaway? Giving the rationale often helps pupils engage with the routine.\n\nTeacher: I will tell them it is to maximise the learning time; the quicker they get started, the more work we will achieve.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nThe table below has some items that will help you to establish effective routines. **The final column is empty for you to complete with your mentor, focusing on either the entry or exit routine you want to develop in your classroom.**\n\n### **The routine I am looking at is:**\n\n| Establishing effective routines                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                         | How can you establish this? |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| Develop the simplest, fastest procedure.                                                     | Handing out equipment/resources: the teacher asks pupils to take one book and pass them along to the next person.                                                                               |                             |\n| Use practice to establish the routine.                                                       | Follow the same routine every time you want the books handed out, asking them to repeat if it does not meet your expectations.                                                                  |                             |\n| Communicate the procedure explicitly and clearly to pupils.                                  | “I want us to be able to start our work quickly and calmly so that means we need to get books in our hands as quickly as possible.

Think about your own experiences of making a positive change like doing more exercise or eating more healthily. You are far more likely to succeed if you plan carefully, thinking about how you will make the change work for you. When you repeat it often enough (practise it) it becomes habit. You’ll also know how easily your good routines can slip.\n\nIt’s the same in school. It is valuable to **practise routines at the beginning of the school year.** The time you invest in this early on will benefit you and your pupils in the long run, making more time available for learning. But it doesn’t stop there. If your pupils do not follow the routine, you will need to reteach it. Even a well-established routine needs positive reinforcement and practice. Being consistent will have a huge impact on your classroom.\n\nHow do we know we have established our routines successfully?\n\n- Pupils know what to do – and do it!\n- Routines are followed consistently and efficiently.\n- When routines are not followed, pupils understand what happens and why.\n\nWatch the video below of a routine going wrong and answer the questions.\n\n## Video\n\n### **Title**\n\nReteaching routines\n\n### **Video type**\n\nClassroom interaction\n\n### **Short description**\n\nPupils do not follow the required routine (entering the classroom) exactly as the teacher wants, so she reteaches the routine.\n\n### **Guidance**\n\nWhen routines do not go to plan, they need to be re-taught.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nNARRATION\nWith routines, consistency is key.

This is beneficial for all pupils, and especially those with special educational needs, whose learning may be particularly hindered when the learning environment is not calm, secure or predictable. We will look more closely at how to adapt teaching for the learning of all pupils in Block 3. The key to making pupils feel safe and secure is to always be predictable and consistent in your response to pupils.\n\nHave a look at the table below, which highlights some of the things that you can do to create a predictable, safe environment.\n\n| What to do                                                                                                                | How this creates a predictable environment                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Establish routines and stick to them.                                                                                     | - Pupils know what they need to do. - Routines become habit. - Takes away anxiety because pupils know what is expected of them.                  |\n| Greet pupils at the door with a smile every lesson.                                                                       | - Pupils will begin the lesson in a positive way.                                                                                                |\n| Be consistent in the way you deal with behaviour.

This encourages further effort, whatever level the pupil is working at.\n- Use positive language to give directions or address behaviour: sanctions are used positively with a focus on returning to learning as quickly as possible.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Try this...</h3>\nUse non-verbal signals to provide feedback about behaviour. For example, in an upcoming\nlesson, practise:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Using smiles and nods rather than verbal praise for pupils who are following\n    your routines effectively.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Positioning yourself in the classroom near pupils who are not doing what is\n    expected.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nBy narrating the positive things pupils are doing in your classroom, you can quickly get pupils on task and encourage good behaviour. If you do this every lesson, it will create a positive climate for learning as pupils will expect you to recognise and highlight the good things going on in your classroom. Take a look at the video below to see how you can do this in practice.\n\n## Video\n\n### **Title**\n\nPraising positive behaviour\n\n### **Video type**\n\nClassroom footage\n\n### **Short description**\n\nIn the classroom, a class gets started on a task\n\n### ****Guidance****\n\n- What does the teacher say?\n- What does the teacher do?\n- What is the impact of this?\n\n### **Filming brief for teachers**\n\n- Give clear instructions for a task.\n- Visibly scan the room to see how pupils are getting started.\n- Give praise to those pupils who are following instructions ‘well done……I can see you are opening your book and getting started’.\n- Praise individuals and tables as appropriate.\n- Focus on the pupils who are doing the correct thing.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nNARRATION\nInstead of correcting negative behaviour, I want to demonstrate and model positive behaviour.

We are now going to think about this in terms of poor behaviour. When you are teaching, you want 100% of pupils to be focused, on task and engaged so that you are able to teach and they are able to learn. So, what should you do if a pupil misbehaves? Let’s consider the following key questions you should ask yourself:\n\n- How can I maintain the positive environment I have created?\n- What does the school policy say?\n- What intervention will be the least invasive and will get the behaviour I want to see?\n\nKnowing the different interventions you can employ, and the order in which to do these, is a vital part of dealing with poor behaviour in your classroom. Ideally you want intervention to be fast, invisible and always to use the least intrusive approach possible.\n\nUsing the least intrusive intervention allows us to:\n\n- Promote good relationships\n- Make pupils feel safe and secure\n- Prevent poor behaviour escalating\n- Help pupils self-regulate their behaviour\n- Maintain the positive climate for learning.\n\nTake a look at the table below to see the behaviour interventions beginning with the least intrusive and slowly escalating as necessary:\n\n| Behaviour intervention          | What is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Non-verbal                      | A signal to pupils to show the behaviour you want to see.

You need to think carefully about the instructions for tasks and activities, communicating these clearly, making explicit:\n\n- The task\n- Time expectations\n- What resources might be required and how to use them\n- How they are expected to work with their peers (e.g. on their own, paired work or in groups).\n\nWhen posing whole-class questions, you are clear about how you wish the pupils to respond, drawing as much as possible on non-verbal or short verbal prompts as opposed to lengthy explanations.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Understand what is expected of them.\n- Begin tasks promptly and purposefully needing minimal guidance on what they are meant to be doing.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “We are now going to move onto the next activity. As you can see there is a worksheet in front of you. In a moment, you will complete activity 1 on the worksheet using full sentences. You are going to do this in pairs, and you will have five minutes to complete it. If you finish before the five minutes is up, you will read your reading book in silence. Let’s do question A together first.”\n\n## Area 2: Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins (7d)\n\n### Ensure all pupils follow given instructions.\n\n#### You should...\n\n- Quickly and accurately gauge the pupils’ understanding of the instruction or direction before they begin.\n- Expect all pupils to follow the direction, monitoring pupils’ engagement with the direction and intervening with minimum disruption if required to do so (see [1.4: Learning about… Maintaining consistently high behavioural expectations](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/establishing-a-positive-climate-for-learning/1-4-learning-about-maintaining-consistently-high-behavioural-expectations/)) OR ask pupils to perform the activity again if directions are not followed as desired.\n- Adapt swiftly and pre-empt where pupils might find a direction too complex so that learning time is not lost e.g. rephrase or break the direction down further.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Understand what to do, and follow directions quickly, maximising learning time.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “Daniel, can you explain the instructions back to me?”\n- “Show me on your fingers how many minutes you have to complete this task.”\n- “What should the noise level be when we work with our partner?”\n\n**_What other questions could you ask to check the understanding of your instructions?_**\n\n## Area 3: Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions (7e)\n\n### Use non-verbal signals.\n\nRaise your hand when you want silence.\n\n#### You should...\n\nRaise your hand\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Fall to silence quickly when they see the hand signal.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\nAs the activity draws to a close, the teacher raises her hand. She does this a little ahead of when she wants silence, so she ensures there is enough take up time for this to be successful. As the class begins to fall silent, she praises individuals, and this brings more pupils to silence.\n\n### Use non-verbal signals.\n\nPut your fingers to your lips instead of saying ‘shhh’.\n\n#### You should...\n\nPut your fingers to your lips\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Fall to silence quickly when they see the hand signal.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\nInstead of using ‘shhh’ which increases the noise levels and if ignored undermines the teacher, she instead puts her fingers to her lips to say ‘you need to be silent now’. By not contributing further to noise levels, this helps to bring the class to silence.\n\n### Use non-verbal signals.\n\nPut your hands to your ears when you want pupils to listen.\n\n#### You should...\n\nPut your hands to your ears\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Respond quickly and know that they need to listen next.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\nThis acts as an effective visual prompt for pupils and reminds them that they need to use their ears for listening.\n\n### Use non-verbal signals.\n\nTap a book open instead of saying open your book.\n\n#### You should..\n\nTap a book open\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Understand to open their book and noise levels have not been raised.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\nAgain, rather than contributing to noise level in the classroom, the teacher simply taps the book open to show what she wants to happen. This could be done for a variety of things, e.g.:\n\n- Pointing to the board\n- Pointing to the bin if a pupil is chewing gum\n- Putting a pen down and folding arms to stop pupils from tapping pens during instructions.\n\n### Use consistent language\n\nUse ‘thank you’ instead of ‘please’ at the end of instructions.\n\n#### You should...\n\n- At the end of a command, it is better to say thank you than please as it is more authoritative and less open to interpretation by the pupil.\n- Avoid saying “Can you…” at the start of your sentence.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Follow your instructions quickly and with little argument.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\n“I’d like you to put your pen down, thank you.”\n\n“I’d like you to stand behind your chairs, thank you.”\n\n“Turn around and face the front, thank you.”\n\n### Use consistent language.\n\nCount down when you want silence.\n\n#### You should...\n\n- When you have decided you want the class’s attention, use the counting down method to bring the class gradually to silence.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...\n\n- Gradually fall silent with little hassle or having to speak over pupils.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice...\n\n“In a few moments, I am going to start counting down from 5. When I get to zero you will be in silence.\n\n5…4…start to finish your sentence…3…make sure you have put your pens down…2…put your eyes to the front on me…1….well done to X. X, X you are doing that beautifully…And 0…thank you everyone.”\n\n## Area 4: Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption (7f)\n\n### **Non-verbal prompts**.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nA quick gesture or prompt (or remind) the pupil of the expected action they should take, given without interruption to teaching.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- Gesturing a pupil to look at the board.\n- Nodding and smiling when a pupil has done what was expected of them.\n\n### Positive group reminder.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nA swift verbal reminder of the expected behaviour given to the whole class but providing a prompt for any individual you have noticed that needs it.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “I need all eyes on the board. Thank you, Simona. Looking this way please Ollie.”\n\n### Anonymous reminder.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nAs above, but this time noting that there are some people who are not complying.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “I need all eyes on the board…I need two more sets of eyes.”\n\n### Private individual reminder.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nIn this case, you might set the class off on the task and discreetly approach a pupil who has not been complying to give a private reminder of the expectation.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “Jacob, I need to be sure that you are working on this as hard as you can.”\n\n### Lightning-quick public correction.\n\n#### Explanation\n\nGive a quick correction directly to the pupil telling them what they need to do and then normalise the behaviour to what the rest of the class are doing.\n\n#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…\n\n- Return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.\n\n#### What this might look like in practice\n\n- “Anika, looking at the board, just like Mal and Jamie. Thank you.”\n\n", nil, "ff71eea7-a97d-45ec-9c1a-2a946e82aa74"],

For students to learn, they must transfer information from their working memory into their long-term memory (Deans of Impact, 2015). Learning is a lasting change in understanding and capability. Understanding how learning takes place, and barriers to it occurring, is vitally important for teachers.\n\n## An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\nLook at the definitions below for long-term memory and working memory.\n<ul>\n  <li>Are you clear on the difference between long-term and working memory?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n| Long-term memory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Working memory                                                                                                                               |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| A vast storehouse in which you maintain your factual knowledge about the world… long-term memory resides outside of awareness. It lies quietly until it is needed, and then enters the working memory and so becomes conscious. (Willingham, 2009) | Part of the short-term memory, the working memory is a short-term store for information required during thought processes. (Braddeley, 2003) |\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The diagram provides a simple illustration of the mind, indicating that experiences of the external Environment enter the Working Memory (the site of awareness and thinking) before being stored in the Long-term Memory (as factual knowledge and procedural knowledge). Arrows indicate that information can also be recalled from the Long-term Memory to be used in the Working Memory when needed. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-2.2.1-How-the-mind-works-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nBoth long-term and working memory play important roles in learning.\n\nWhen we encounter something new which has the potential to be learnt - for example learning about lines of symmetry in maths - it is first processed in the working memory before transitioning into the long-term memory once it has been learnt.\n\nNew information that we notice in our environment (e.g. what the teacher is teaching) interacts in our working memory with prior knowledge, which is stored in the long-term memory. In this case, knowledge the pupil has stored in their long-term memory related to symmetry, perhaps from work in Drama on reflections and mirroring, can be pulled into the working memory to support understanding of the new knowledge.\n\nWhen the pupil learns the definition of symmetry and how to recognise lines of symmetry in shapes this new knowledge will either be forgotten or begin its journey to move into their long-term memory where it can be called upon when needed - in other words it has been learnt.\n\n## Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge\n\nOur long-term memory sorts and stores all information into categories, or schemata (Kirschner et al., 2018). These “interconnected webs of information” group information so you don’t need to remember lots of individual pieces of knowledge.\n\nWhen the pupil learns about lines of symmetry in maths, their schema on “shape properties” is added to and adapts to absorb the new information. If learnt, symmetry is now stored in their long-term memory. Next time they encounter it, they will be able to pull the learning into their working memory to interact with other new stimuli in the environment and overtime engage in more complex applications of the concept, for example recognising symmetry in compositions in art.\n\nOf course, not all information that makes its way into our long-term memory will be there forever. The reason you may forget something which you previously knew (such as your childhood best friend’s phone number) relates to two things:\n\n- retrieval strength, or how often you access the memory over time; and\n- storage strength, or how deeply embedded the information was in your long-term memory including how many schemata the individual item is linked to.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nIn the example below, the teacher applies their understanding of long-term memory,\nschema and working memory when introducing new content.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    How does the teacher help pupils to retrieve information from their\n    long-term memory?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    What techniques do they use to make the information available in the working\n    memory for the next task?\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTeacher: “We’ve been reading some really spooky stories and today we are going to\nstart thinking about some vocabulary we can use when we draft our own scary stories.\nCan anyone remember some of the words we found yesterday in our story book?”\n\nPupils: Scary, Spooky, Mysterious, Monster, Eerie, Twisted\n\nTeacher: “Yes, they’re perfect – they make me shiver! The monster in that story was REALLY scary!\n\nWhat other scary stories have you read?\"\n\nPupils offer Goosebumps as a popular choice.\n\nTeacher: “How would you think of scary words? What could you do?\"\n\nPupils offer: think about books they have read at home, movies they have watched at home or pictures they have seen.\n\nTeacher: “Now, have a look around the room and you can see lots of different images which might inspire you. Each table has a big piece of paper. I’m going to give you 5 minutes to work in your groups to think about all of the scary stories you have heard or read before and to list out as many different words which you associate with scary stories as possible. An example to get you started – I know that ghosts are scary so I am going to write that down.”\n\n[Pupils complete the task]\n\nTeacher: “Wow, we have so many amazing words for everyone here! I am now going to put these up on the wall so you can look up and use both the pictures and now our word banks to inspire your writing! Let’s read and talk about them as we put them up”.\n$I\n\n## Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded\n\nThe implications of how memory works for classroom teaching are significant.\n\nIn particular, the capacity limitations of the working memory affect how pupils learn.\n\nAs you have just seen, working memory is the _processing_ area of the memory. Unlike the long-term memory (which has infinite capacity to store information), the working memory can only handle a limited amount at one time (thought to be between 5 and 9 items). If a pupil experiences cognitive overload, whereby the amount of information they need to hold exceeds the processing capacity of the working memory, they will be unable to complete the task or engage with it meaningfully.\n\nWhat you might see in your classroom for a pupil who is experiencing cognitive overload:\n\n- Incomplete recall of instructions\n- Missing out or repeating parts of a task\n- Giving up as the task seems overwhelmingly complex\n- Appears to be inattentive, have a short attention span, and be easily distracted.\n\n(Adapted from Gathercole, et al., 2006)\n\nSweller (2016) tells us that since working memory has a limited capacity, instructional methods need to avoid overloading it with additional activities and information which don’t directly contribute to the learning. This might include unnecessarily detailed examples or going off on a tangent rather than clearly focusing on the content which pupils need to learn.\n\nThere are several techniques which are useful in the classroom for reducing the cognitive load on the working memory.\n\n## **1. Take into account pupils’ prior** knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce and link what pupils already know to what is being taught\n\nHelping pupils to draw on prior knowledge – linking to existing schemata - when they encounter new knowledge will reduce the burden on the working memory. For teachers this has two implications. Firstly, you should think carefully about what pupils already know about the area of learning. If their knowledge is limited, you should be especially careful when introducing new material and be very conscious of the risk of overloading pupils with too much information. Secondly, you should _link_ the new learning to what you believe they already know. We will look in more detail at the role of prior knowledge in Activity 2.3.\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nAn Early Years classroom, the video shows how a teacher takes prior knowledge into account when introducing content and directly links what pupils already know to what is being taught.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- What do you notice about how the teacher links the new material to pupils’ prior knowledge to help them learn the new word?\n- How does the teacher take into account prior knowledge before introducing the new word?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nPupils have been listening to and participating in a variety of songs and stories on a space travel theme, the initial interest for which was originally observed during free play.\n\nThe role play area has subsequently been developed to include a rocket and related resources. The teacher has noted that the children have begun to use previously introduced space travel story vocabulary in their play and are beginning to talk about where they will go on their adventures. The teacher is keen to introduce a new word: future.\n\nThis week the children have been reading the story ‘Astro Girl’.\n\nTeacher: This week we’ve been reading ‘Astro Girl’, another space story! Let’s read it again!\n\nTeacher reads the story in an engaging way, using movement, gesture and varied tone to ensure continued interest. The focus is on the flow of the story and any complex or unfamiliar vocabulary has been previously discussed.\n\nTeacher: So, Astrid wants to be an astronaut in the future. That’s a new word, ‘future’. Does anyone know what it means?\n\nChild 1: I know how to get into the future! We need to go in an electric, really fast transformer car. When we get there, we find treasure. Treasure with food in it!\n\nTeacher: Wow, that sounds really exciting! I know you like cars that go really fast! In this story, Astrid wants to be an astronaut in the future. Future means something that hasn’t happened yet…like when Astrid has grown up.\n\nChild 2: I’m going to be a dancer when I have growed up.\n\nTeacher: I remember your dancing show! The future just means something that hasn’t happened yet but is going to. It can even mean tomorrow. I’m taking my cat to see the vet tomorrow.\n\nChild 3: I’m going to my grandma’s tomorrow.\n\nTeacher: Are you? We’ll that’s in the future! It hasn’t happened yet. Sometimes the future is something very soon but sometimes it’s a long way ahead.\n\n[During free play, the teacher supports the conversation to include the new word and where the children will travel next on their adventures.]\n\nAt the end of the day, the practitioner talks to the children about their plans for the weekend again, reminding them that it’s in the future because it hasn’t happened yet. It’s important that the examples given are within the children’s realm of experience and that they hear this word several times to get a clear understanding of it.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## 2. Avoid overloading the working memory by considering how much new material to introduce at one time and breaking complex material into smaller steps\n\nAnother practical way you can avoid overloading working memory is to only introduce new material in small, manageable steps (Rosenshine, 2012). Ensuring pupils master foundational material and that it has had time to embed in the long-term memory before moving on will prevent working memory from becoming overloaded and support pupils to engage with more complex material. This is also true when teaching complex material to pupils: breaking it down and supporting pupils’ working memory with partially completed examples can help avoid cognitive overload.\n\n$I\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\nIn the examples below, both teachers want their pupils to learn some complex material\nabout the effects of war on a country. Think about these questions:\n<ul>\n  <li>Which teacher will be more successful?</li>\n  <li>Why?</li>\n  <li>\n    How does Teacher B take cognitive load into account when teaching the\n    material?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<table width=\"587\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"587\">\n        <h3>\n          <strong>Example A</strong>\n        </h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Teacher A teaches the content from the front.

Each factor has\n            a page which has been broken into key categories. For example, there\n            is a section on ‘Definition’, ‘Example’, ‘Three key points’,\n            ‘Important vocabulary’.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            The teacher has partially completed some of the boxes, for example\n            adding the key vocabulary and pupils need to add the definitions or\n            including the definition and pupils need to add the key vocabulary.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            The teacher gives pupils a few minutes to complete the page in their\n            workbook after each factor is introduced before continuing.\n          </li>\n          <li>This takes up the entire lesson.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n$I\n\n## 3. Reduce distractions which take attention away from what is being taught so that attention is focused on the content\n\nBecause working memory is limited, it is important that you avoid overloading it with unnecessary information that doesn’t directly contribute to pupil learning. It can be easy to mistake engagement and enjoyment for learning. Activities must be centered around what we want pupils to learn. While superficially appealing, it is easy to get carried away planning ‘fun’ activities that actually take pupils’ attention away from the content. For example, in a game to complete as many questions in the time as possible, pupils are likely to be thinking about the time limit and how many questions they complete at the expense of thinking hard about the content.\n\nThis is not to say that you should avoid planning activities for pupils. You can make learning both active and focused on the content. Consider a ‘hook’ activity at the start of a topic on DNA. The teacher sets up a crime scene and pupils collect clues to solve a Whodunnit. At this stage pupils do not have enough content knowledge to engage meaningfully with the topic, and so the lesson takes time away from understanding the foundational knowledge of this topic. Instead, the teacher could teach the content they need to learn first and then pupils complete the Whodunnit when they are ready to apply their learning to a new context.\n\nAnother factor to consider is complexity. If a pupil cannot easily follow the steps of a task then their working memory will be preoccupied with trying to remember what they are supposed to do rather than thinking about the content. Similarly, if a pupil cannot decipher the main point of your explanation their working memory will be distracted by trying to figure out what is important to remember and what is not.\n\nSome things you can do to reduce distractions include:\n\n- Focus activities and tasks on the content rather than distracting ‘games’ which have little to do with the material.\n- Ensure that there is a thinking element involved in activities such as ordering, sorting, grouping or matching.\n- Every activity should be focused on the content and what you want pupils to learn. If it is not, do not use the activity.\n- Consider when you use an activity to ensure pupils have the required knowledge to participate fully in it.\n- Minimise the complexity of tasks so pupils don’t need to remember lots of steps.\n- For more complicated tasks, write the steps which pupils need to remember on the board and leave them there so pupils can refer back to them during the task.\n- Use short, clear explanations and examples to demonstrate your points - plan these in advance so they are high quality and concise.\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA GCSE Biology lesson.

DNA controls the colour of our eyes and our skin and other things. We are going to do an activity which demonstrates how the chromosomes work in pairs to pass on information to a new cell. Chromosomes make up our DNA. If the pairs are messed up, that is when we get things like diseases, but they also decide whether we are male or female when we are born because of the X and Y. If you have the same, you’re a girl and different you’re a boy. You’ve got 23 socks in your pile, and I want you to try and match them up as fast as you can to the socks on the washing lines like our chromosomes pair up! Everyone ready? OK, go!\n\nPupils dash to match up the socks.\n\nTeacher: OK, if I want you to now give me the chromosomes for a girl baby, what would you do?\n\nPupils show confusion and no answer offered.\n\nTeacher: Right, let’s go back to the start…\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA GCSE Biology lesson.

DNA are the molecules which carry our genetic code. This genetic code determines things like your eye colour. Doctors might draw your blood to read your DNA code because it is carried in your blood cells. What other genetic features do you think we get from our DNA? Have a quick chat with your partner to come up with some examples.\n\nPupils: Skin colour, height, whether you have freckles or not…\n\nTeacher: Great. Let’s look a little closer at what is inside your DNA. Look at this diagram on the board which shows a zoom in of your DNA strand. These thread-like structures are called chromosomes. Each human has 46 chromosomes which are organised into pairs. How many pairs of chromosomes must we each have?\n\nPupil: 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n\nTeacher: Correct, 23 x 2 = 46 so we have 23 pairs of chromosomes. We receive 23 from our mum and 23 from our dad and they join together to form pairs. One of these pairs will determine whether you are born a boy or a girl. A boy chromosome is called Y, and a X chromosome is female. The chromosome your mum will pass to you is always X (female), but a sperm can carry either an X or a Y so depending on which combination is successful, you’ll be a girl or a boy. Both XXs will be female but an XY will be male.

Having an extensive and secure background (prior) knowledge helps pupils to integrate new learning into schemata in their long-term memory. This explains why novices (e.g. your pupils with limited schema) find it harder to learn new ideas compared to experts (e.g. adults with extensive schemas).\n\nFor example, as pupils move through school, they will encounter many and increasingly complex literary devices. Each time they are introduced to a new technique it connects to existing knowledge and extends and reinforces their schema on ‘literary devices’. For example, a pupil will learn descriptive adjectives in KS1, they will build on this to learn similes in KS2, this will be developed to include metaphor as a concept in KS3 and then building on all of this to understand text level metaphor at GCSE.\n\nThe second is that the more prior knowledge a pupil has about a topic in their long-term memory, the more space will be freed up in the working memory to engage with more complex ideas and reflect on meaning. Here’s an example many of us will recognise:\n\n$I\nConsider learning to drive. When you first learn you are conscious of every decision; how far to turn the wheel, when to look in your mirrors, how hard to press the accelerator etc. Over time, and with repetition, this knowledge is transferred to your long-term memory and you are freed up to use working memory for other thinking tasks, such as remembering a set of directions in a new city. If you still had to use your working memory to figure out what every road sign means, you would likely spend an unnecessary amount of time driving around and missing your turn offs.\n(Adapted from Willingham, 2009)\n$I\n\nHow does this apply to the classroom? It means we need to think carefully about how we sequence knowledge and whether some knowledge is particularly important as a basis for other concepts. We look at this idea of foundational concepts in Block 4. For now, it is important to note that by committing a number of key facts to long-term memory pupils free up working memory to think about more complex ideas. What these facts are will differ depending on the age of your students and the subject you teach.\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nTalking heads\n\n### Short description\n\nA group of teachers who teach across different year groups speak about the most important facts they want pupils to have committed to their long-term memory to aid their teaching.\n\nTeacher 1 (Primary, Year 6)\nTeacher 2 (Maths, Year 7)\nTeacher 3 (Primary, Year 2)\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How do the teachers decide on which key facts would be beneficial in pupils’ long-term memory?\n- How do they take prior knowledge into account?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/TPHPtWbx2tU)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nTeacher 1: By the time I get them in Year 6, I am hoping that there are quite a few things already committed to long-term memory, especially in the core subjects. It makes Year 6 a lot easier (for me and the pupils) if they are confident, active and engaged readers, with a solid vocabulary base. If pupils can enhance their writing with vocabulary from their wider reading and improve it in the drafting process, their outcomes are more cohesive. Not necessarily subject-specific language which I know they will cover in Year 6 but a broad base. I get so fed up with everything being described as “nice”. There are so many other adjectives out there! It’s also helpful if they automatically use the rules of grammar, such as capital letters, new paragraphs, full stops and the punctuation to demonstrate direct speech. The Year 6 curriculum becomes quite dense with colons, semi-colons etc. which means that it helps if I don’t have to still correct basic grammar they should know already.\n\nTeacher 2: The first thing I do at the start of Year 7 is check how fluent my new classes are with things like their times tables, formal addition, subtraction and written multiplication and division methods. I know I can teach them everything else they need to know but if they don’t have the four operations at their fingertips, it slows everything down and they have to really think about each calculation when I want them to be concentrating on a new idea or concept.\n\nTeacher 3: In Year 2, I know that the pupils don’t have tons of prior knowledge to build on, but I am really aware that I am building the foundations for later. I focus on core skills like embedding phonics and securing the spelling rules, really improving literacy skills so pupils are starting to read more fluently. Automatic recall is key. This means that pupils can focus on comprehension and recall. I also spend lots of time working on basic grammar such as full stops, question marks and capital letters so pupils’ writing can flow. Before I begin teaching this, I will assess starting points so that I am really clear on what pupils can already do.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    What might be some of the key facts that are important for your\n    phase/subject?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    How might you take into consideration pupils’ prior knowledge of key facts\n    in your phase/subject when planning?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly\n\nWe all understand what is meant by a misconception. It may be a simple misunderstanding. It can also be a faulty belief, where people have come to the wrong conclusion – because of a lack of understanding or having the wrong information – and it has stuck. Multiplying two numbers doesn’t always give a bigger answer (think decimals); heavy items don’t always sink in liquid (think oil); and there are occasions when you can start a sentence with ‘because’.\n\nWe also now know that all new learning is related to prior knowledge. Stronger and more developed prior knowledge makes it easier for us to learn new, related things. Where the reverse is true and prior knowledge is weak or shallow, pupils are more likely to learn things incorrectly by forming misconceptions. This is because pupils will form incorrect connections or make assumptions to fill gaps in their knowledge.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nIn the examples below Ava and Tyler have developed misconceptions based on shallow\nor incomplete prior knowledge.\n\nAs you read, consider how these misconceptions have formed and how their teacher might be able to spot them?\n\nAva is in Year 7. She loves storytelling and so is excited when her first piece of writing in English is to write a creative story about an adventure three friends go on. When she receives her feedback from the teacher, Ava is upset to see so many corrections circled and that she was marked down for grammar. Ava doesn’t understand – she thought that you used an apostrophe to show that something was plural so she used it throughout her story (e.g. The three friend’s walked quickly towards the bicycle’s which they would use to get away).\n\nTyler is in Year 1. He has noticed that the trees had leaves which were green during the summer when he played in the park but now that it’s autumn, the leaves have changed colours to yellow and brown! It’s fun because he can kick them. At the school entrance there is a tree which has stayed green which is confusing. It’s a smaller tree though and his teacher told him it was called a holly bush so Tyler assumes that trees can only be trees if they lose their leaves, all the others are bushes.\n$I\n\nYour pupils will come into your class with existing prior knowledge. While it’s impossible to know and take into account all the prior knowledge each of your pupils brings, you can safely assume that some of this prior knowledge will be weak or shallow and has already or will potentially lead to misconceptions. This is why careful planning and thought needs to go into identifying possible misconceptions and then planning how to prevent these forming.\n\nIn the example above, Ava had insecure prior knowledge about apostrophes before she was introduced to the idea that apostrophes can be used to show plurals. Her existing schemata on grammar and apostrophes was too weak and so she only remembered the fact that an apostrophe is used with an s to show possession. She has extended this understanding and now uses apostrophes – incorrectly – to form plurals. Her teacher might spot the consistent error in her writing and be able to make an intervention.\n\nTyler has made an assumption about what makes a tree a tree based on his observations and through a partial understanding. Unchecked this could lead to lots of confusion later on. His teacher may not spot the misconception immediately but through further questioning and dialogue they may pick up on his misconception.\n\nThere are a few simple techniques which Ava and Tyler’s teachers can use to help prevent misconceptions forming where prior knowledge is weak or insecure:\n\n- Think about what prior knowledge a pupil might or should have before planning to introduce new content:\n\n  - Look at schemes of work for previous year groups\n  - Refer to department or phase schemes of work\n  - Ask your mentor or another colleague.\n\n- Identify what prior knowledge pupils hold about a topic and how secure it is:\n\n  - Use questioning to get pupils to share their ideas or thinking\n  - Ask pupils to write down everything they know about a topic in a mind map\n  - Use a short quiz before starting a topic to assess specific prior knowledge.\n\n- Take your time introducing new content, strengthening the prior knowledge:\n\n  - Slow down when you are introducing new content. Take your time to allow for discussion and questions\n  - Show how it connects to a previous bit of learning with examples and explanations\n  - Include questions which draw on the prior knowledge as well as new content\n\nYou will work with your mentor in session 2.2 to plan how to introduce new content when prior knowledge is weak.\n\n## Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn\n\nNow we understand how the memory works and its role in learning, and the way in which existing knowledge helps pupils to learn new knowledge, we can think about what this means for our teaching. We will look in much greater detail at the types of classroom practice which make learning more likely in Block 3. For now, let’s focus on one area that is particularly relevant to the factors we have been learning about: worked examples.\n\nA worked example is a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task or solve a problem. According to Wittwer & Renkl (2010), there is “abundant empirical evidence showing that example-based learning ... is more effective than learning by problem solving alone”. With all tasks we set in the classroom, pupils are likely to perform better if they are shown how to do something, step by step, rather than asked to figure it out for themselves.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The illustration shows a teacher standing at the front of a class, modelling an example with a solution so that pupils can observe the method used rather than simultaneously trying to solve the problem for themselves. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-2.2.2-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n## Supporting pupil learning with worked examples\n\nThe reasons why pupils learn better with worked examples will be familiar to you now. When pupils are confronted by a new task or problem it places high demands on their working memory. The combination of content information and the need to work out how to solve the task can be overwhelming. If pupils are given worked examples to support them during the process of problem solving, it frees up space within their working memory. This makes them more likely to succeed in the task when they do it independently.\n\nThe amount of guidance or annotation you provide in a worked example will vary depending on the context and the levels of expertise of your pupils, but a general rule is that the more novice a pupil, the more complete the worked example should be. As they develop their levels of expertise, gradually reducing the level of supporting information is beneficial for pupil learning.\n\nWhile a worked example can support pupil learning by easing some of the cognitive burden, their effectiveness is even greater when they are used in particular ways:\n\n- A large number of experiments have demonstrated that pupils learn more when alternating between worked examples and solving problems on their own, so long as the problems are similar to the worked example (Pachler et al., 2007).\n- If a pupil actively explains the worked example to themselves (or others) they will be even better prepared to transfer the knowledge to new problems (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010).\n\nYou will work with your mentor in session 2.6 on worked examples and there is an opportunity to practise them in the activities below.\n\n", nil, "7b1fc420-f826-442f-889f-4a04591ad82b"],

Annotate your answer showing the steps you took to complete the task (e.g. “Divide by 2 on both sides to balance”, “underline the adjectives & circle the verbs”).\n- Give pupils questions to complete independently and instruct them to use your worked example to guide them.\n\n#### Live model a worked example on the board\n\n- Display a question or task which you would like pupils to be able to complete. Use a whiteboard or a visualiser to work through the example question, verbalising each step in your thinking and process, e.g. “I am first going to draw out the sweets each person has”.\n- Do more than one worked example on the board if needed.\n- When ready, set pupils some questions similar to the one you have just solved which could be partially solved already to help manage the cognitive load.\n- Leave your worked example on the board as a prompt.\n\n## Help pupils commit key facts to their long-term memory\n\n### Doing this in your classroom will mean…\n\n- Pupils will be able to recall a set of facts or knowledge from memory.\n- Pupils will engage with complex ideas, drawing on key facts which they have in their memory.\n- Pupils will be confident when encountering complex content because they have secure foundational knowledge.\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Flashcards\n\n- Create a set of flashcards for the subject or theme with the key facts you want them to learn. You could either create these yourself in advance, or with older pupils create them together.\n- Put a question or prompt on one side, and the answer on the other.\n- Have a class set or one set per student.\n- Pupils can spend time (in class or at home) using the cards to retrieve knowledge. They ask a question, recall the answer and say it out loud, then flip it over to check whether it is correct.\n- Pupils should only remove a card from the deck when they have seen it come up three times or more and have correctly answered it.\n- Pupils should shuffle the deck in between retrieval practice so the order doesn’t become predictable.\n\n#### Quiz, quiz, trade\n\n- Plan a set of flashcards which have questions on one side and answers on the other.\n- It works well with content you want pupils to repeat a lot (e.g. times tables or quotes from a text).\n- Give each pupil a card and ask them to work with a pupil next to them.\n- Pupils take turns to ask each other the questions on their card and have time to check the answers with each other (quiz, quiz).\n- Pupils then swap cards (trade) and turn around to speak to a new partner.\n- To ensure that the focus remains on the content which you want pupils to learn, you might include a capture sheet where pupils can write down their working out or record their answers as they go.\n- It might be helpful to have some extra cards ready because pupils will naturally start to circle back to the same cards again so you can quickly swap a card in and out if that happens.\n\n## Encourage pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so misconceptions can be addressed\n\n### Doing this in your classroom will mean…\n\n- Pupils expose existing gaps in their prior knowledge or existing misconceptions before you teach new material.\n- Your planning will improve to take into account pupil prior knowledge and potential misconceptions as they are forming.\n- You address points of confusion and misconceptions quickly before they take root.\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Think, pair, share\n\n- It is helpful to set up pairs in advance and label pupils A or B.\n- Pose a question to the class.\n- Give time for pupils to **think**. This should be on their own. They might write down their ideas or thoughts in their books.\n- After a few minutes, ask pupils to talk in **pairs**. Pupil A goes first, followed by B. They should compare answers. Did they agree/disagree?\n- During this time, you should circulate and listen in to pairs’ answers to hear what they have understood or not.\n- Once pupils have had enough time to discuss the answer in pairs, bring the class back together and call on a few pupils to **share** their ideas from the pair with the class.\n- You can use this information to decide what to do next. If there are misconceptions or misunderstandings, you can intervene and maybe re-teach that part. If everyone has understood, you can move on to the next stage of the lesson.\n\n#### Shared misconceptions\n\n- Choose a topic or a concept which you have been learning about.\n- Write some multiple-choice question on the topic, including some misconceptions you think the class may have.\n- When you have looked at pupil answers identify which of the misconceptions are common in the class.\n- Talk it through with the class and dissect the thinking.\n- Present it in a positive way to show pupils that uncovering and correcting misconceptions is an important part of learning.\n- Use questioning to get pupils to unpick the misconception.\n- Ask pupils to then correct their own work.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try? \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do? </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened? </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    What will you do next<span>?</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "bdd89a18-0899-40b9-bfd8-d3a8a091bb55"],

Effective teachers are the ones who help pupils learn something they never thought they could, the ones who help pupils to understand new processes and ideas through well-structured lessons. They stimulate pupils to think hard and their support is well planned and tailored to meet the needs of all pupils so that every pupil experiences success even with challenging problems.\n\nIn Block 2, you learned about how pupils learn. You considered what working and long-term memory are and learnt about cognitive load. Effective teachers understand the theory of how pupils learn and apply techniques and strategies which make learning more likely to happen. You explored some of these techniques in Block 2, such as how to present information to avoid cognitive overload.\n\nIn this Block, we will look at some more of the fundamental techniques which lead to effective teaching:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Presenting new material in small steps</li>\n  <li>High quality expositions</li>\n  <li>Modelling and worked examples</li>\n  <li>Scaffolding and guiding learning</li>\n  <li>Practice</li>\n  <li>Teaching pupils metacognitive strategies.</li>\n</ul>\nWe will also be looking at what it means to “adapt your teaching”. At the heart of\nthis is recognising that pupils, like the rest of us, have differences. It is important\nto understand that our classrooms are diverse places and it is our responsibility\nas teachers to ensure that all pupils learn and make progress. This is not about\nproviding different lessons for different pupils – it is about knowing your pupils\nand having sufficient tools in your toolbox to be able to respond and meet their\nneeds.\n\nIn this Block you will look at:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to effectively monitor pupils’ progress in lessons</li>\n  <li>\n    Knowing when to intervene or adapt lessons “in the moment” whilst\n    maintaining high expectations, so that all pupils make great progress\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Knowing approaches for scaffolding learning for pupils who are making slower\n    progress or struggling to engage.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBecoming an effective teacher is not a quick tick-list of techniques and approaches\nyou can use in the classroom. Each of the techniques you will explore in this Block\nrequire practice and you will refine them over time. You should be sure to make good\nuse of the observation opportunities in this Block to both see the approaches being\nused by more experienced teachers and to receive feedback as you develop your own\nteaching craft. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "5386458d-fced-482b-b811-70699f7e5a47"],

Effective teaching approaches can not only directly impact your pupils’ success in school (OECD, 2015) but will also have a longer-term impact on their attitude to learning throughout their lives. You can transform their knowledge, but also their belief in their own capabilities. You will learn much more about motivation and the impact of teaching on how pupils feel about learning in Block 7.\n\nSo what techniques and strategies do effective teachers use? Let’s find out.\n\n## Effective teachers introduce material in steps\n\nIn Block 2, you learned that our working memory is a short-term store for the information that you use during thought processes (Braddeley, 2003) and that our long-term memory is a vast storehouse where you retain your knowledge about the world (Willingham, 2009). Long-term memory has no known limit to its capacity.\n\nAccording to Rosenshine:\n\n$I\n… more effective teachers do not overwhelm their students by presenting too much new material at once. Rather, <strong>these teachers only present small amounts of new material at any time, and then assist the students as they practise this material</strong>. Only after the students have mastered the first step do teachers proceed to the next step.\n$I\n\nIn this regard, effective teaching might look something like this:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The diagram is a flowchart showing how a teacher could present information in small sections so that pupils are more likely to understand and remember what is being taught. The teacher introduces a small section of content, explaining the idea and modelling an example.&lt;p>&lt;/p>Pupils independently practise a similar task with guidance and support from the teacher as required, before discussing what they have just learned and explaining it in their own words.&lt;p>&lt;/p>The teacher checks for understanding, using verbal questioning or mini whiteboards.&lt;p>&lt;/p>Once the teacher is happy, they move on to the next section. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-3.2.1-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nConsider the following example.\n\n- How have they broken the content into smaller steps?\n- How do they make sure that pupils master the content before moving on?\n- How has the teacher built up to the more complex task of writing your own sentences?\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example mini lesson plan and script – Year 2</h3>\nTeaching sentence structure.\n<ol>\n  <li>Starter: introduce the rules of a simple sentence.</li>\n  <li>Show a sentence on the board: “The boy threw the ball.”</li>\n  <li>Read sentence together.</li>\n  <li>\n    Model aloud my thinking as I identify the subject of the paragraph.\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        “OK so we know that a simple sentence needs to contain a verb, a subject\n        and an object. I am going to look at the sentence here and identify\n        these things.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        “Hmmm, so I know that a verb is a doing word. So the verb in this\n        sentence must be ‘threw’. Am I right? Yes, ‘throw’ is a doing word so\n        that is a verb. I am going to circle it to show that it is the verb. Now\n        I need to work out the subject.

In other words, if pupils can draw on existing knowledge, it helps them to process new knowledge. In fact, with enough practice, schemas can “become automatic… automatic processing of schemas requires minimal working memory resources and allows problem solving to proceed with minimal effort” (Kalyuga, 2003).\n\nAs you become more experienced, you will be more easily able to link new ideas to previously studied material. This is because your knowledge of the curriculum over time will grow each year as you teach it (more on this in Block 4). You will know what you have already taught and what pupils are taught more widely in the school, meaning you can link current and upcoming learning of knowledge and skills to previous content.\n\nAn effective teacher will make this connection explicit, linking new material to what has been previously studied and learned by using some of these techniques:\n\n- **Verbally making the link:** “We’re going to talk about compound sentences today. Do you remember last week when we spoke about simple sentences?”\n- **Demonstrating how the new idea links to previously studied material with examples:** “The first step I use is to make sure my sentence is an independent clause which we practised in last week's lesson.”\n- **Using “link” activities which remind pupils of the learning from previous lessons:** “You are going to write four simple sentences about your trip to the zoo. First, we are going to make a bullet point list of what to include ‒ you will need 1) subject 2) verb 3) object.\n\n## Effective teachers use modelling to help pupils understand new processes and ideas\n\nWhen we teach, we ask pupils to undertake tasks. These tasks should make pupils actively process (i.e. think hard about) the material. With cognitive load theory in mind, it is important that we make tasks easy to understand, so that pupils can use their processing power on the content rather than trying to work out what it is they are expected to do.\n\nProviding models is the fourth principle in Rosenshine’s Principles of Instruction (2012). Modelling means showing a pupil how to do something rather than asking them to follow instructions or find their way through a task themselves. Having a whole process modelled means that pupils can concentrate on the really important learning moments.\n\nIt is important that your model demonstrates the highest possible standard of what can be achieved and makes it accessible so pupils can reach the same standard.\n\nHere are some ways that you might do this:\n\n- Thinking aloud whilst demonstrating how to solve a problem/complete a task. This shows pupils how experts think.\n- Using worked examples – provide the solution as well as the steps taken to arrive at it.\n- Showing pupils how you expect them to record and present their work.\n- Demonstrating how pupils should participate in an activity or use resources.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nModelling how to plot points on a graph, Year 5\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher explaining to his class how to plot points on an axis\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How does the teacher communicate how to plot points on a graph?\n- How does he show his pupils what he wants them to do?\n- How does he know that pupils have understood how to complete the task?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nTeacher: 3, 2, 1… Thank you, Year 5. Now that we can read the coordinates of points on a graph, we are going to plot some ourselves.\n\n[Cut to shot of the board which has an empty X and Y axis. Also possible to use a visualiser instead.]\n\nOK, who remembers the coordinates of this point in the corner where the two lines meet?\n\nPupil: It is zero zero.\n\nTeacher: Yes, this is co-ordinate zero, zero and this is where you will always start from. To start, I am going to hold my pen on the coordinate zero zero like this.\n\n[Teacher holds marker on zero zero.] The coordinate we will plot is (3, 5). Who remembers which axis the 3 tells us to move on?\n\nPupil: The X axis, so sideways!\n\nTeacher: Correct. The 3 is first so it tells me to move 3 steps on the X axis. Watch carefully as I move my pen 1, 2, 3. [Teacher models jumping each step and counting out loud as they go.]\n\nNow, I need to move 5 places in the Y axis so holding my pen really steady where I have landed I now go up for 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. [Teacher models pen jumping up 5 steps.] Why am I doing it this way? I know that I should use the values on the X and the Y axes as these two scales represent the values of different coordinates.\n\nI’ve now moved 3 across and 5 up from the starting point of (0,0). This is where I draw my X. It should be in line with the number 3 on the X axis and the number 5 on the Y axis. Look at how I check by drawing an invisible line with my finger to each axis to check.\n\nI’m going to try another one and this time, Ben I’d like you to give me the step by step instructions. How would I plot co-ordinate (4, 3)?\n\nBen: Right – first thing is you have to start on zero zero so put your pen there...\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Effective teachers use good models which make abstract ideas concrete and accessible\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What is meant by an “abstract idea”?</h3>\nAn abstract idea or concept is one which can be difficult to grasp.\n\nAn abstract idea is one which is removed from what you can see in front of you (a concrete idea). Some words don’t actually have a concrete equivalent ‒ e.g. bravery, power, justice or freedom. Some abstract concepts are symbolic, representing concrete things: Whilst seeing 3 coins is concrete and visible, the number 3 is an abstraction. Young children will need to learn about “threeness” from the physical world before they can use it in mathematics.\n\nExpecting pupils to understand what an abstract idea is from its definition alone is insufficient to support their understanding. It might help pupils to understand an abstract concept through a concrete example: a beach can be used as a concrete example of the concept of erosion.\n$I\n\nIn their education, pupils will encounter many abstract ideas that pupils need to grasp. Effective teachers “use models all the time to provide a bridge between pupils’ current ideas and understanding and new understanding” (EEF, 2018). Pupils are more likely to retain knowledge if they are given multiple examples.\n\nModels are an essential part of developing and sharing knowledge. Evidence suggests that:\n\n- The ideas that models are based on should be familiar to pupils, as otherwise this can confuse them further.\n- It is important that pupils understand how models differ from the idea being taught and learn the underlying idea rather than the model.\n\nThe table below shows the different strategies you can use to make abstract ideas accessible.\n\n| Strategy                                                                                       | Example                                                                                    |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Using a range of examples to demonstrate the abstract idea                                     | “Here are three different examples of when someone was considered ‘brave’.”                |\n| Facilitate discussion around an abstract idea to let pupils relate it to their own experiences | “When was a time that you felt ‘free’?”                                                    |\n| Provide opportunities for pupils to experience an abstract concept for themselves              | “This morning, I am going to give all of the ‘power’ of deciding what we do in PE to you.” |\n| Use concrete models or examples to make abstract ideas accessible                              | “We are going to count out the number 12 using cubes.”                                     |\n| Provide a graphical representation to make abstract ideas accessible                           | “Take a look at the bar graph to compare the speed of the two cars.”                       |\n| Provide a visual example to make abstract ideas accessible                                     | “The pictures in front of you show each stage of the evaporation cycle.”                   |\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Using concrete examples to make abstract ideas accessible</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>How do objects help to make abstract ideas accessible?</li>\n  <li>\n    How might this relate to your subject? Is there a physical representation of\n    an abstract idea?\n  </li>\n</ul>\nYou may want to use a physical object that pupils or teachers can touch and move\nto support teaching and learning. These can be powerful tools for supporting\npupils to engage with ideas. However, they are just tools: how they are used is\nimportant. They need to be used purposefully and appropriately in order to have\nan impact. Teachers should ensure that there is a clear rationale for using a\nconcrete example to teach a specific concept. The aim is to use these to reveal\nstructures and enable pupils to understand the subject independently.\n<h4>\n  <b>Maths example </b>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Cuisenaire rods.</li>\n  <li>Dienes blocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n  <b>Examples of different forms include:</b>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Two fractions represented on a number line.</li>\n  <li>\n    A quadratic function expressed algebraically or presented visually as a\n    graph.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A probability distribution presented in a table or represented as a\n    histogram.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n  <b>Concrete examples in use</b>\n</h4>\nThe teacher wants to show an abstract rule (10t – t = (10 – 1)t = 9t) through a\nconcrete example.\n\nA teacher said, “Give me a two-digit number ending in 0.”\n\nA pupil said, “Forty.”\n\nThe teacher said, “I’m going to subtract the tens digit from the number: 40 – 4 gives me 36.”\n\nThe pupils tried this with other two-digit numbers ending in 0 and discovered that the result was always a multiple of 9.\n\nThe teacher said, “I’m going to use multilink cubes to see whether this will help us see why we always get a multiple of 9.”\n\nThe teacher made four sticks of 10 cubes each. “So here is 40.

The most effective teachers often spend longer guiding practice of new material than less effective teachers. When guided practice is too short, pupils make more errors during independent work.\n\nTeachers can guide pupils as they rehearse new content by:\n\n- Asking questions to check for understanding (“What do you understand about X?”)\n- Asking pupils to summarise key points (“Can you tell me the main reasons why?”)\n- Supervising pupils as they practise a new skill (“Let me watch you try.”)\n- Giving immediate feedback, correcting errors (“I notice you have used X and it is resulting in Y. Try this instead.”)\n\nInitially this guidance is likely to come from the teacher, but our ultimate aim is for pupils to be able to practise and perform a skill independently. As pupils undertake guided practice and move towards independent practice, resources (such as graphic organisers, pictures, tables, graphs and charts) and teacher action (such as the questioning shown above) can provide them with additional support or guidance without the need to rely so heavily on the teacher. Our task is always to move them from where they are to where they need to be.\n\n### Scaffolds\n\n$I\nThe metaphor of scaffolding is derived from construction work where it represents a temporary structure that is used to erect a building. In education, scaffolding refers to support that is tailored to students’ needs.\n\nVan de Pol, J., Volman, M., Oort, F., &amp; Beishuizen, J. (2015)\n$I\n\nYou put up scaffolds all the time when you are teaching. Think of a time when you have asked a question, and a pupil has expressed confusion. You don’t just move on; you ask another question which re-phrases the question or you point them to a previous example which will help them. These informal teaching moments when you guide pupils through new learning are examples of scaffolding.\n\nYou can also plan scaffolds in advance of a lesson. This could be in how you present new information, breaking it down into steps as we saw earlier in this section. It could also be by providing a framework for pupils to follow, which supports them to apply a complex skill with support.\n\nWhenever we design a task or activity, we need to consider which resources might help to purposefully scaffold pupils' learning, whilst still ensuring they engage cognitively with the content. We can also encourage pupils to think about and explain their own levels of understanding before starting on a task. Developing pupils’ ability to reflect in this way may mean that less time needs to be spent on diagnosing who needs what support (Van de Pol et al., 2015).\n\nYou can use this series of questions to help guide your decisions:\n\n1. Who would benefit from resources/scaffolding, e.g. the whole class or certain individuals?\n2. In which part(s) of the lesson are resources required, e.g. as part of instruction/for guided practice/for independent work?\n3. What resources would be most appropriate and effective to facilitate learning, e.g. physical resources/written prompt/visuals?\n4. How and when will you withdraw the scaffolding if you need to?\n5. How will you assess whether continued support is needed?\n6. How will you ensure you don’t over-support or over-scaffold?\n7. How will you encourage pupils to reflect on their own learning and strengths/weaknesses?\n\nThe following examples show this in practice:\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA Year 2 class having a discussion\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- What scaffolds does the teacher provide?\n- How effective are these in facilitating the discussion?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nTeacher: OK everyone, you should now be sitting in your trios.

Teachers tend to place a premium on content delivery instead of supporting pupils to practise applying new ideas effectively.\n\nPractice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success. Remember that practice is an important aspect of learning, but not all practice is equally important (Deans for Impact, 2015).\n\nDuring the initial stages of learning it is vital that pupils experience success. This will be motivating and will ensure that pupils continue to try, which is the basis for deepening and extending their understanding. We can help pupils to be successful by:\n\n1. Preparing pupils for practice – ensuring we have clearly communicated what it is we expect them to do through high-quality instructions and modelling.\n2. Monitoring pupils as they practise – checking for understanding and intervening where required.\n3. Using verbal feedback during lesson in place of written feedback after lessons where possible.\n\nBreaking a complex skill or procedure into smaller parts also enables us to pinpoint more specifically where in the process pupils are making mistakes; in isolating each step, we can identify the exact point in a process that pupils are going wrong and provide feedback at the point in time where it will make the greatest difference.\n\nYou will look at “Retrieval practice” specifically in Block 8.\n\n## Effective teachers recognise that support should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases\n\nThe levels of support discussed above should not be maintained forever. You won’t be following your pupils into their exams or beyond the school gates, so at some point you need to begin gradually removing support.\n\nThe importance of this gradual removal of support is reinforced by the research where “strong evidence has emerged that the effectiveness of these techniques depends very much on levels of learner expertise. Instructional techniques that are highly effective with inexperienced learners can lose their effectiveness and even have negative consequences when used with more experienced learners. We call this phenomenon the expertise reversal effect” (Kalyuga, 2007).\n\nThe “guidance fading effect” tells us that novices require high levels of guidance during the early stages of learning, whereas for experts, such detailed guidance is unnecessary, or redundant, and could even be counter-productive.\n\nAs pupils develop expertise, we need to make sure we continually increase the challenge and reduce the amount of guidance we are giving them. Although we will need to fade guidance for different pupils at different rates, it is essential that all pupils reach this stage eventually.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The diagram is a flowchart illustrating that the level of guidance is reduced over time until the pupil is able to complete a task without any support. The stages listed are:&lt;p>&lt;/p>Teacher instruction. Heavy guidance. Light guidance. Minimal guidance. Independence. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-3.2.2-Fading-guidance-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThere are a number of ways that we can fade our guidance, e.g.:\n\n- Gradually removing scaffolding from activities and tasks so that pupils complete activities with greater independence.\n- Reducing the amount of guidance provided by the teacher or other adults meaning that pupils are increasingly required to draw upon their own developing knowledge to make sense of material.\n- Combining steps or teaching material in larger “chunks” so that pupils understand how ideas link together and begin to perform procedures in their entirety.\n\n| Task                                                                           | Increased support                                                                                                                                                                                 | Reducing support                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pupils need to identify metaphors and similes in a piece of text.              | Pupils have a checklist to complete with definitions of metaphors and similes and one of each identified in advance.                                                                              | Pupils do the task without support.                               |\n| Pupils need to complete a piece of extended writing on the Battle of Hastings. | The teacher models “What a Good One Looks Like” on the board using a shared writing technique. Shared writing is where the teacher works with the class to produce a model version of the answer. | Pupils complete the task with the support of some sentence stems. |\n| Pupils need to complete a certain number of maths problems.                    | The teacher and teaching assistant sit with specific groups and complete worked examples on a mini-whiteboard.                                                                                    | The teacher and teaching assistant circulate during the activity. |\n\nAs we have already considered, the ultimate aim is for pupils to be able to perform a skill or apply their learning independently. We need to make this aim clear to our pupils and encourage them to strive towards independence and mastery but recognising that scaffolds and supports help them on the way.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nCoe, R., Aloisi, C., Higgins, S., &amp; Major, L.

The EEF Teaching and Learning Toolkit rates metacognition and self-regulation as a “high-impact, low-cost approach to improving the outcomes of disadvantaged learners” (EEF, 2019).\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What is metacognition?</h3>\nMetacognition is about the ways learners monitor and purposefully direct their learning.\n\nFor example, having decided that a particular cognitive strategy for memorisation is likely to be successful, a pupil then monitors whether it has indeed been successful and then deliberately changes (or not) their memorisation method based on that evidence.\n\nBy metacognitive strategies, we mean the strategies we use to monitor or control our cognition, such as checking that our memorisation technique was accurate or selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy for the task we are undertaking.\n\nEducation Endowment Foundation (2017) Metacognition and Self-regulated learning Guidance Report. [Online] Accessible from:<a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/\"> https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/</a>\n$I\n\nEffective metacognitive strategies get learners to think about their own learning more explicitly, usually by teaching them to:\n\n- Set goals.\n- Monitor their learning.\n- Evaluate their own academic progress.\n\nA simple way to think about metacognitive strategies is how well a pupil is able to recall learned processes to solve challenges. For example, if a pupil is reading and comes across an unfamiliar word, they might have learned the following strategy they can employ:\n\n- Break the word down.\n- Read the sentence again and consider the context.\n- Consider what definition would make sense.\n- Look up the definition to check they are right.\n\nThis strategy can be drawn upon any time a pupil comes across an unfamiliar word. Metacognitive thinking such as this helps pupils work out what is effective and what isn’t. Explicitly teaching metacognition not only helps the pupils with individual tasks but also helps them become more efficient learners who are able to make more progress.\n\n### Figure 1: The Metacognition Cycle\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The diagram shows the metacognition cycle around any given task:&lt;p>&lt;/p>Metacognitive knowledge (of myself, the task, and strategies) flows into&lt;p>&lt;/p>Planning, which flows into&lt;p>&lt;/p>Monitoring, which flows into&lt;p>&lt;/p>Evaluation, which flows back into Metacognitive knowledge. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-3.2.3-The-Metacognition-Cycle-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nEducation Endowment Foundation (2018) Improving Secondary Science Guidance Report. [Online] Accessible from: <https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/>\n\nYou explored how pupils learn in Block 2. Metacognitive strategies will help your pupils to become aware of how their learning is going. When new content enters their working memory, they are consciously processing new material. This process can be monitored through metacognitive approaches, such as asking:\n\n- “Do I know what this word means?”\n- “Do I need to change my approach here?”\n\nThis helps pupils to identify what they know and, importantly, what they do not know.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n- What does Freya do which suggests she is a successful self-regulated learner?\n- What is the impact of her metacognitive strategies?\n- Why are these important?\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nFreya fiddled with her pencil case. Every Friday, she would experience a quiet dread\nwhen facing the weekly spelling test.\n\nThis week, though, she felt more confident than before. After a couple of weeks characterised by annoying mistakes, she had worked hard in readiness for this week’s test. She had devised two of her own mnemonics and she had practised her “le” ending words, as well as “surprise’ with an ‘r’”, repeatedly.\n\nAs Mr Thomas began the spelling test, Freya listened hard. She knew that sometimes she would feel a little pressure when her teacher moved quickly onto the next spelling, but that this week she would listen carefully and remember what she had practised. One or two words were no doubt tricky, but Freya had weighed up her options each time and she was utterly confident of her success.\n\nBefore Mr Thomas had a chance to cycle through the correct spellings, Freya sat up straight, with a smile lighting up her face, fueled by quiet satisfaction. She had already thought about her new spelling routine and how she would stick to it next week too.\n$I\n\nLet’s take a closer look at Freya’s process. She:\n\n- Utilised cognitive strategies, like using mnemonics and doing some self-testing practice at home.\n- Used metacognitive strategies to plan her spelling practice, recognising why using a mnemonic was the right tool for the job, whilst monitoring her own difficulties with time pressures during the test.\n- Drew on motivational strategies to engage in repeated practice and to persevere during a pressured challenge.\n\n(EEF, 2017)\n\nFreya has been taught these strategies, rather than acquiring them by chance, and is therefore able to employ them effectively. It is likely that she has gone through a few different processes and this has become a repertoire she can draw on. As the example demonstrates, her confidence increases which will be of benefit in future tasks. So how should we go about teaching metacognitive strategies to our pupils?\n\n- **Make sure pupils know** what they are and why they are important. Muijs & Reynolds (2018) tell us that “pupils need to know why they are learning metacognitive skills, otherwise they lack the motivation to use them”.\n- **Teach metacognition explicitly.** The EEF (2017) suggest that we should “explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate their learning.” A series of steps — beginning with activating prior knowledge and leading to independent practice before ending in structured reflection — can be applied to different subjects, ages and contents.\n- **Embed metacognition within subject teaching.** Muijs & Reynolds (2017) also suggest that “metacognition shouldn’t be taught as a standalone skill, or in separate lessons, but needs to be embedded in subject teaching.” This is because the strategies are often task or subject specific.\n- **Make sure pupils have strategies “to hand”.** Remind pupils to use the strategies you have taught them and use questioning and feedback to push them towards better use of them.\n\nThe table below shows how teachers can help reinforce metacognition and reflection by prompting pupils in this way, using the example of drawing or painting a self-portrait in art:\n\n|              | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | How?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Plan**     | This encourages pupils to think about the purpose of their learning and about how they will go about the task. Pupils need to understand the goal, activate relevant prior knowledge, select appropriate strategies, and consider how to allocate their effort. | What resources do I need to carry out a self-portrait? Have I done a self-portrait before and was it successful? What have I learned from the examples we looked at earlier? Where do I start and what viewpoint will I use? Do I need a line guide to keep my features in proportion? |\n| **Monitor**  | This emphasises the need, whilst undertaking the task, for pupils to assess the progress they are making. This could include self-testing and self-questioning activities and then making changes to their chosen strategies.                                   | Am I doing well? Do I need any different techniques to improve my self-portrait? Are all of my facial features in proportion? Am I finding this challenging? Is there anything I need to stop and change to improve my self-portrait?                                                  |\n| **Evaluate** | This appraises the effectiveness of their plan and its implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                          | How did I do? Did my line guide strategy work? Was it the right viewpoint to choose? How would I do a better self-portrait next time? Are there other perspectives, viewpoints or techniques I would like to try or find out about?                                                    |\n\n(Adapted from Education Endowment Foundation (2017) _Metacognition and Self-regulated learning Guidance Report_.

These differences will range from their levels of motivation, attitudes towards school and learning to more fixed variables such as their ethnicity or gender. Some of these factors you can influence, and some of them are outside of your control.\n\nSome of these differences and personality traits will affect pupil learning and success in the classroom. For example, a particularly shy pupil may find it difficult to participate in groupwork and will not be forthcoming to let you know when they are struggling with something. Knowing that this pupil is shy means that you can make a particular effort to check on them during tasks. Pupils who have low levels of intrinsic motivation might need support in the form of encouragement to help them develop this trait.\n\nGood teaching has the potential to lead to good results for most pupils providing they also put in the effort. It is worth remembering that there are factors which may make a difference to how pupils learn, e.g. particular Special Educational Needs such as:\n\n- Communication and interaction.\n- Cognition and learning.\n- Behaviour, emotional and social development.\n- Sensory and/or physical.\n\n(Davis et al., 2004)\n\nOf course, teachers can certainly impact positively on pupils with special educational needs but there may be particular barriers to learning which affect their ability to make progress. In Block 6 you will spend more time working with your SENCO to understand these barriers.\n\nAs a consequence of this array of differences, pupils are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed. Pupils need to be treated as individuals and a certain level of personalisation to their education is likely to be beneficial. Your task as a teacher is to work out how to do this in a way which is optimal in terms of pupil learning within the realities of teaching 30 pupils in each class.\n\n## Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching\n\nUnderstanding pupil differences is fundamental to good teaching. There are a number of ways to go about doing this:\n\n- Your school will hold information on all its pupils. There is much useful information that can be gathered to inform your approach for each pupil. There will be data on previous performance, attendance, punctuality and so on. This can help you build a picture of your pupils but be aware of its limitations as the data does not tell you _why_.\n- Whilst this information is useful, it is very important to not build preconceived ideas of what a pupil will be like. It is important to retain high expectations of all pupils.\n- There will be colleagues in the school who know these pupils very well and understand what their barriers to learning might be. These colleagues can be a useful place to find information. In primary, talking to the teacher who taught your class the previous year will be an important part of the handover process, but you should feel that you can continue to ask more experienced colleagues for advice throughout the year. In secondary, it is likely that your school has a “tutor” system. Often the tutor or head of year/phase will know a lot about a pupil.\n- Understanding levels of prior knowledge can be sought through speaking to pupils’ previous teachers and looking at their test scores from the previous year. You will also have a role to play lesson by lesson in understanding levels of prior knowledge by using formative assessment. You will learn more about this in Block 5 on questioning, assessment and feedback.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nUnderstanding pupil differences\n\n### Video type\n\nTalking head\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher talks about how he goes about understanding what the differences are between his pupils.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\nWhat are the practical strategies the teacher uses?\nHow does it inform his approach?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/jbPElQN4ZIo)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nBefore I meet my new class, I go through the data available from the previous teacher. This tells me some information, such as who used to arrive late every day or who has an EHC plan in place. I like to talk to the teacher if possible, as well to get their take on the class, and if there was a teaching assistant who worked in the classroom last year they usually have some great information. If I know before the end of the year which class I am taking, I find it really helpful to look at samples of their work from the end of the year. This shows me what they could do and where there may be gaps in their prior knowledge.\n\nWhen I plan for the first day I always start by saying that whoever they were last year doesn’t matter to me. If they were the pupil who got the most behaviour points, I don’t care, because this is a fresh start. I like to create a space where pupils can choose to be the best versions of themselves and what better than a new teacher and new class. Through the first half term I plan lots of activities which are “class bonding” but are really designed for me to get a better understanding of who they are and how they work. For example, we do an afternoon of problem-solving activities which is really fun but I am actually observing their communication, reasoning, literacy and maths skills so I can decide which groups to organise pupils into for our first topic.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success\n\nWatch the following video. You will notice that the pupils have all been given the same task. This is not because the pupils are of the same ability. Carefully consider the actions of the teacher. Bring your notes to Mentor Session 6 where you will discuss them.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nAssertive monitoring\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nThe pupils have all been given the same task. This is not because the pupils are of the same ability.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- What is the teacher doing in the lesson to maximise each pupil's progress during their independent practice?\n- What did the teacher need to think about or prepare before the lesson in order to do this?\n- What happens when the teacher notices that a pupil is struggling?\n- What is the impact of the strategy?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThe teacher starts by giving an explanation of the task that the pupils are going to do. All pupils have the same task. It is not obvious from the video what the range of ability is within the classroom. The teacher lets the class know how many minutes they have to complete the task.\n\nShe then sets the class off on the task.\n\nImmediately she begins to circulate the pupils. She checks on individual pupils by looking over their shoulder at what they are doing. She offers short prompts and interventions where necessary. She narrates out loud what she is doing to the whole class and then targets additional support at specific pupils.\n\n“I am coming round now checking on… I will tick it if correct, I’ll put a dot if it’s not.”\n\nTeacher circulates the class and goes to one table at the front:\n\n“Is everyone happy with the task? Any questions?” No. Teacher ticks or dots their work.\n\nTo the whole class:\n\n“I am now coming round checking X part of your work...”\n\nTeacher approaches an individual pupil and reads their work.\n\n(Quietly) “This is excellent Rahim, just fix this part…”\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nYou will have the opportunity to practise this technique in Activity 3.5.\n\n## Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils\n\nUntil quite recently the prevailing trend was to create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils within the classroom as a differentiation technique, e.g. the teacher producing multiple versions of the same worksheet. Not only did this approach affect teacher workload, activities of this kind can place limits on pupil achievement.\n\nOther popular differentiation strategies were to differentiate by time and differentiate by outcome.\n\nWith these strategies, teachers had different expectations of what pupils could complete in the allocated time and to what standard. A consequence of this was a lowering of expectations of what pupils could and should achieve.\n\nYour approach should be to have high expectations of every child, looking for ways to support each of them step by step to achieve the learning objectives.\n\n## There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial\n\nLearning styles theory was popular in education for some time with many people believing that individuals had a preferred learning style (e.g. auditory, visual, kinesthetic) and that pupils would learn better if taught in that predominant style. This is not supported by any credible evidence (Willingham, 2010) and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.\n\nWhat is true is that learners are different from each other, and that these differences can affect their performance.\n\n$I\n\n<em>\n  In claiming that learning styles do not exist, we are not saying that all\n  learners are the same. Rather, we assert that a certain number of dimensions\n  (ability, background knowledge, interest) vary from person to person and are\n  known to affect learning. The emphasis on learning styles, we think, often\n  comes at the cost of attention to these other important dimensions.\n</em>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(Willingham, 2010)</p>\n$I\n\nThings to watch out for:\n\n- Being told that a pupil “learns best kinesthetically” and therefore should be allowed to wander around the classroom when they feel like it. There is very little evidence of successful interventions based on learning styles theory. (Willingham 2004)\n- Activities which claim to exercise pupils’ multiple intelligences, such as getting pupils to sing and dance when reciting times tables. Gardner (1995) describes such use of multiple intelligences as trivial. This is trivial because pupils are not really engaged in the thing they need to think hard about.\n- A colleague gives you advice to prepare three different versions of the same worked example, one which uses pictures, one which uses words and one which includes a video recording of yourself completing it so pupils have “choice” about how to study. Do not spend your time creating these resources ‒ one quality resource (e.g. talking pupils through a written example) will be better.\n\n", nil, "bac26afc-6c46-44db-9553-679965c11984"],

Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain.\n- 4i. Narrating thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working independently and drawing pupils’ attention to links with prior knowledge).\n- 4j. Making the steps in a process memorable and ensuring pupils can recall them (e.g. naming them, developing mnemonics, or linking to memorable stories).\n\n### If this is successful, you will see…\n\n- Pupils having a clear grasp of what they need to do.\n- Pupils able to ‘get on’ with tasks with success.\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Using a pre-prepared model answer\n\nChoose a lesson where you will ask pupils to complete an independent piece of work, e.g. an exam answer or extended piece of writing.\n\nFor example, you may want pupils to complete a GCSE exam answer which requires extended writing. Use the mark scheme to write a model response which allows the pupils to see what is required. For GCSE and A-level, the exam boards often produce ‘Examiners Reports’ which contain real student responses to questions. It can be useful to share pre-prepared responses that are different levels of quality – support pupils to be able to differentiate between what high-quality and low-quality look like. Something you can do is to ask pupils to re-write a poorer-quality response using a higher-quality response as a guide.\n\nA top tip is to make sure you save the pre-prepared models that you develop so that you can use them in future years/classes. Another thing you can do is to photocopy/scan good quality responses produced by your pupils which you can use with other classes in future years.\n\n#### Narrate your thought process\n\nNarrating your thought processes when modelling can help to make explicit how experts think - remember you are trying to move your pupils from novice to expert. This should allow pupils to see the steps you take, but also the kind of metacognitive strategies you use.\n\nExamples of times you might to do this:\n\n- Completing a piece of extended writing\n- Revising a piece of writing\n- Balancing an equation\n- Completing an experiment in science\n\nYou could either do this on the board or using a visualiser.\n\nLook at the following modelled example which has been broken down into sections to help you.\n\n$I\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Task: Mason and Jasmine have £5 between them. Mason has 90p more than Jasmine.\n  How much money does Jasmine have? \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Okay so this is a tricky one. So firstly I need to think about how we have\n  solved equations like this before and choose the best strategy. I know that\n  word problems can often be solved by expressing them as equations….so I am\n  going to start with writing out the problem as an algebraic equation. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Has this helped me? Yes, it now looks like the type of problem I’m familiar\n  with. I can now have a go at working it out.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  So £5 is 500p which will be easier to work with.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Firstly I need to take the extra 90 away so 500-90=410\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Now I need to divide this by 2 so 410/2=205\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I know that one of the answers is 205.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now I need to add the extra 90 to 205</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">205+90=295 </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  To check my answers I can put my answers into the word problem to see if they\n  work.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now I know that: </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine has £2.05</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mason has £2.95</span>\n$I\n\n#### Develop mnemonics and memorable stories\n\nA mnemonic is a system such as a pattern of letters or associations which assist in remembering something.\n\nIn history, a helpful mnemonic is C-O-P-E. It helps pupils COPE with analysing sources:\n\nC - Content\n\nO - Origin\n\nP - Purpose\n\nE - Evaluate\n\nIn maths or science, a helpful mnemonic is RUCSAC (as in, keep your problem solving tools in your rucksack):\n\nR - Read\n\nU - Underline\n\nC - Choose\n\nS - Solve\n\nA - Answer\n\nC - Check\n\nIt would be useful to talk to colleagues in your subject/phase to see if there are any helpful ones they already use with pupils.\n\nAnother strategy is to use a memorable story to help pupils remember something complicated. For example, you could link a sequence of events to familiar sequences from your life (e.g. walking around your house).\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Which idea(s) for practice did you try?</li>\n  <li>What did you do?</li>\n  <li>What happened?</li>\n  <li>What will you do next?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Area 2: Practice makes perfect\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\nLearn that:\n\n4.8 Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.\n\n### If this is successful, you will see...\n\n- Pupils can remember information\n- They develop confidence, accuracy and speed when retrieving key knowledge\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Low-stakes quizzing\n\nLow-stakes quizzing is a helpful tool for you to check your pupils' understanding and to develop their recall of key ideas. The fact that it is low-stakes means that pupils will not feel threatened to ‘have a go’ in case they get it wrong.\n\nBe explicit that the quiz is low-stakes, i.e. “I will not be recording your score”; “This is not an assessment”.\n\nFor younger pupils, or those with EAL or SEN needs – or where you know that the knowledge is new or insecure – you may need to provide support in order for them to be able to succeed. You might do the following:\n\n- Use closed questions more than open questions\n- Use multiple-choice questions\n- ‘Push’ questions which guide towards a certain idea\n- Partially completed sentences\n- Cloze-type activities (e.g. gap fills)\n- Partially completed concept maps\n\nYou can find more useful information here: [https://www.retrievalpractice.org](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/)\n\n#### ‘Brain dumps’\n\nA ‘brain dump’ is when you ask pupils to write down everything they know about a topic. You could do this in a number of ways:\n\n- Individually\n- In pairs\n- In groups\n- A combination of the above - e.g. on your own first, now share with your partner, now pool your information as a group\n\nYou could also do this in a number of mediums:\n\n- Mind map\n- On paper\n- On the board\n- On whiteboards\n- On their table using a wipeable pen\n- On poster paper\n\nYou could also do this at various points:\n\n- Beginning of the lesson in one colour - “What can you remember about”\n- End of the lesson in another colour - “What else can you now remember”\n- At the end of a topic unit\n- As revision\n\nDoing this encourages pupils to try to remember information which supports transfer to long-term memory.\n\n#### Exit tickets\n\nGive pupils a slip of paper, ‘a ticket’, at the end of the lesson. On the ticket should be a series of questions (around 2 or 3) about what they have learned that lesson. In order to be able to ‘exit’ the lesson, they need to complete the ticket. This encourages pupils to reflect on what they’ve learned and actively process it.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Which idea(s) for practice did you try?</li>\n  <li>What did you do?</li>\n  <li>What happened?</li>\n  <li>What will you do next?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Area 3: Adapt your teaching\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\nLearn that:\n\n- 5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.\n- 5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.\n- 5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.\n- 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.\n- 5a. Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.\n- 5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations.\n\n### If this is successful, you will see…\n\n- Pupils who are sufficiently challenged in their learning\n- Pupils are able to ‘get on’ with the task they are set\n- Pupils are successful in the tasks\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Assertive monitoring\n\nThe core idea of assertive monitoring is:\n\n- By systematically checking pupils' work during a lesson a teacher can see what they have or have not understood.\n- They can respond ‘in the moment’ when pupils have got things wrong or are not meeting success criteria and get them to ‘fix it’.\n\nHow to do it:\n\n- Decide what ‘good work looks like’\n\n  - In advance of the lesson, make sure you know what you are expecting in terms of ‘good work’\n\n- Plan your laps:\n\n  - What will you be looking for in each round of monitoring?\n  - Name your laps as you circulate - ‘now I will be looking for’\n\n- Plan a monitoring pathway:\n\n  - Create a seating chart\n  - Monitor the fastest workers first, then those needing more support\n\n- Pen in hand – mark pupils’ work\n\n  - Give feedback (tick, star, circle, code)\n\n- Cue pupils to revise answers with minimal intervention (name the error, ask them to ‘fix it’, tell them how you’ll follow up)\n\n- Record monitoring feedback\n\n  - Check pupils’ work\n  - Track right / wrong answers or trends in the class as you circulate.\n\n#### Reshape instruction\n\nBeing prepared to make adjustments within a lesson to provide support or challenge to individuals, groups of pupils or the whole class as appropriate. Use this when you notice that either a pupil has not understood something, is confused or they have mastered the new content and are ready to consider more complex material.\n\nIdeas for support might include:\n\n- Revising explanations - providing examples, breaking down information into smaller steps\n- Re-teach a piece of content or key concepts\n- Use questioning to guide pupils’ practice\n\nIdeas for challenging might include:\n\n- Ask pupils can they think of a non-example or a time when it is not true?\n- Amend tasks such as removing scaffolding or using more difficult numbers\n- Add extension tasks to provide further challenge\n- Move onto the new material. If for just a small group, teach on a table so they can move on whilst you support others.\n\n#### Make effective use of resources, including additional adults\n\n1. For a lesson or sequence of lessons you are going to teach, review the resources you plan to use. Use the following questions to guide your thinking:\n\n- Who might need additional resources?\n- What kind of additional resources might be needed?\n- Have I got enough written structures in place for this lesson, e.g. sentence stems?\n- Have I used word banks or glossaries to support vocabulary?\n- Are there any concrete resources, such as props or models that might help aid understanding?\n\n2. Plan how you will deploy any additional adults you have in the classroom:\n\n- Who will they work with?\n- What information might they need prior to the lesson?\n- What misconceptions might they hold which you do not want to pass onto pupils?\n- When should they withdraw their support and how?\n\n$I\nYou do not need to create distinct tasks for different pupils. Think about how you can provide support to pupils so that they can all achieve and reach a high standard.\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "0d32adfa-a41f-4376-a3a0-2ce77ad9406d"],

In most schools the curriculum is made up of discrete subjects, such as maths, or groupings of subjects, such as humanities. You might already feel confident in one or more subject or curriculum areas having studied it at university. Many people become teachers because of a passion for a subject and – if you ask them – will try to make the case for why their preferred subject is the most important in the curriculum! Of course, depending on the phase or department in which you teach you may well be teaching multiple subjects.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation that a teacher’s <em>subject knowledge </em>is critical. There is acceptance in the literature that secure subject knowledge is a defining characteristic of effective teaching.\n\nThe in-depth, advanced subject knowledge you may have developed through university study will need to evolve further in order to make this knowledge accessible to the pupils you teach. Learning to do this will help you motivate your pupils and teach more effectively, leading to improved pupil outcomes. If you are teaching a subject or subjects which you feel less confident with, it is even more important to spend the time developing your subject and curriculum knowledge.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Secure subject knowledge will allow you to better sequence lessons and\n    episodes of learning as you have a more sophisticated understanding of the\n    small steps it takes to master the particular content you are trying to\n    teach.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Secure subject knowledge will allow you to anticipate common misconceptions\n    and to plan intentionally for these.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    We know that pupils’ motivation is derived from their feelings of success ‒\n    the better they are taught, the more likely they are to be successful and\n    therefore motivated.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTo be effective in teaching any subject you will need to be explicit in teaching\npupils the knowledge and skills they need to be successful. You will need to have\na particularly strong understanding of the essential concepts within the subject\nor subjects you teach in order to ensure that pupils have a secure foundation from\nwhich to begin to think critically about the subject.\n\nExperienced and effective teachers have a strong repertoire of examples to explain these key ideas – we know that pupils learn better when abstract concepts are illustrated with multiple, concrete examples. You will also start to see how generic pedagogical strategies can best be applied within each subject: tools like questioning can only be truly effective if the question is devised from a place of secure knowledge.\n\nDedicating time to developing your subject and curriculum knowledge can also be hard to do among the myriad of competing priorities that you face in school, especially at the beginning of your career. It can feel more important to deal with immediate concerns, such as planning your next lesson or dealing with a behaviour incident, instead of setting aside time to enhance your understanding of the subject and curriculum. This Block will show you the importance of making time to prioritise this aspect of your practice.\n\nThis Block will also support you to develop your understanding of the importance of literacy and build a collection of teaching skills related to it. Improvements in literacy skills support pupils to access the curriculum across all subject areas, not just English or Humanities; and good literacy develops throughout pupils’ school careers, not just in early primary. Every teacher must take responsibility for improving pupils’ literacy skills in their subject area.\n\nBlock 4 has been designed with all of this in mind and seeks to support you with practical strategies to develop your subject and curriculum knowledge, encouraging you to seek out the support and expertise of more experienced colleagues to do so. It builds on everything you have learned so far about classroom practice, how pupils learn and adaptive teaching.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "179b546c-0920-4f81-8151-ae977393c1c5"],

The Early Career Framework states:\n\n$I\nA school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning.\n$I\n\nA similar definition that a lot of schools will look to is that of Ofsted:\n\n$I\nA curriculum is a framework for setting out the aims of a programme of education, including the knowledge and understanding to be gained at each stage; for translating that framework over time into a structure and narrative within an institutional context; and for evaluating what knowledge and understanding pupils have gained against expectations.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Ofsted working definition of curriculum, 2018</p>\n$I\n\nOne of the real strengths of education in England is that schools have a great deal of freedom to set their own curricula. As a result, there are very different visions for education within schools, although all are based around the same national framework for a broad and balanced curriculum.\n\nBefore we consider the evidence in this area, take a minute to write down some ideas about what this looks like in your school. You will have a chance to discuss this with your mentor in your first meeting for this Block.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>What is your school’s broad vision for education?</li>\n  <li>\n    What are the outcomes of this vision and how are the outcomes described? In\n    terms of pupils’ lives? Their results?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    How does this vision translate into your school’s curriculum choices? For\n    example, what subjects does your school offer, or is the learning organised\n    into general themes? What does this look like in your department? And in\n    your classroom?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nWhile schools interpret the national curriculum, further interpretation happens at department, phase and classroom levels. It is usually teachers who are responsible for the selection, sequencing and pacing of subject knowledge, skills and concepts into forms suitable for teaching, such as schemes of work, topic plans and individual lesson plans. As an Early Career Teacher, you may not yet have much control over the “big picture” curriculum in your school but translating that into your lesson planning over time is well within your scope. The more secure your subject knowledge, the more effective you will be at doing this.\n\n## Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively\n\nAt its simplest, the skill of teaching is about making sure pupils understand new things: when teaching new content in a subject area, your goal is to make it “comprehensible to others” (Ball et al., 2008). Having a deep knowledge of the subject you are teaching is essential to be able to do this well. Indeed, when teachers’ knowledge falls below a certain level it can limit students’ learning (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nHattie (2012) explains that expert teachers are able to use their subject knowledge to organise and use content more effectively for pupils to understand. Teachers with secure subject knowledge are more confident to respond to individual student needs, recognise those who need support and change the way information is presented to support learning. This leads to pupils experiencing success, which in turn is motivating and will encourage them to continue trying hard even when content becomes more complex.\n\nSo, what does secure subject knowledge look like? Secure subject knowledge is more than just knowing facts and concepts. Shulman (1986) argued that teachers must also understand the structure and rules of a subject. In other words, teachers need to know both the _what_ and the _why_.\n\n- Understanding why something is true and how central it is to the subject you are teaching allows you to emphasise the key concepts, prioritise foundational knowledge and sequence learning so that pupils can develop a deep understanding of the subject and how new content builds on and connects to previous learning.\n- Understanding why will also help you to anticipate and plan for common misconceptions which pupils may already have or are likely to develop. You explored misconceptions in Block 2 in relation to how pupils learn. Secure subject knowledge will both help you to anticipate misconceptions and to explain them in greater depth to pupils.\n\nWe will look at both these points in more detail in the next section. For now, let’s just take a look at how this type of knowledge helps us in our teaching. For example, having a deep understanding of the subject you are teaching supports you to give thorough and detailed explanations to your pupils which avoids them developing false assumptions. False assumptions over time might embed in their memory as misconceptions.\n\nIn the example below, the teacher responds to a correct answer by expanding beyond superficial understanding of a concept. Why do you think the teacher did this?\n\n$I\n\n<strong>Teacher:</strong> “What is 45 x 10?”\n\n<strong>Student:</strong> “It’s 450! When you times by ten <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\n  you always get a zero on the end.\n</span>\n”\n\n<strong>Teacher:</strong> “You’re correct that 45 x 10 is 450. And you’re right that\nmultiplying by 10 often means that the answer has a zero on the end. But that’s not\nalways true. When you multiply by 10, all of the numbers move up a place value and\nso the 5 units becomes 50. The zero indicates no units. If you multiply 0.3 by 10,\nthe answer would be 3 units. There won’t be a zero on the end.” $I\n\nThe teacher uses their secure subject knowledge to pick up a potential pitfall that might lead to mistakes. This aspect of subject knowledge develops over time and comes with experience. Spending time talking to more experienced colleagues specifically about the misconceptions which pupils will experience in a given area is almost always time well spent. The teacher leaves nothing to chance – they are completely explicit in the way they teach the concept.\n\nWhere there is a fundamental idea or concept which you have identified for pupils to master, the most beneficial approach for pupils is to teach them it explicitly. As you can see from this example, when a teacher is explicit and clearly directs pupils to the knowledge and skills needed in a particular subject area, they help to structure the acquisition of new learning, including how to use the language of the subject (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). This is where secure subject knowledge will support you in motivating and teaching effectively; you will be able to break concepts down and model these in a way that will support all pupils.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What do we mean by explicit teaching?</h3>\nExplicit teaching involves the teacher introducing new material in a careful sequence,\ntaking care to explain new concepts in a structured way. It involves explanation,\nmodelling and practice.\n\nExplicit teaching might include:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Explicitly teaching key vocabulary pupils will need to access the topic\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and\n    principles in the subject\n  </li>\n  <li>Modelling answers or processes on the board</li>\n  <li>\n    Carefully pacing explanations with appropriate use of questioning and\n    practice time\n  </li>\n  <li>Using a variety of examples and non-examples</li>\n  <li>\n    Guiding pupil practice and providing sufficient time for practice and review\n  </li>\n  <li>Helping pupils when they make errors</li>\n</ul>\nPresenting new material in small steps with opportunities to practise after each\nstep is effective, especially if the teacher assists the pupils as they practise\nto scaffold their learning, such as through questioning or further explanations (Rosenshine,\n2012). $I\n\n## Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed\n\nIn the example above, the teacher draws the pupil’s attention to a fundamental concept in mathematics – place value – reinforcing how this core idea is applied within the subject. An important part of your role is to ensure pupils encounter and master the foundational concepts and knowledge in the subjects you teach. Pupils having a firm grasp of these fundamentals will allow them to succeed as they encounter new topics in the subject and consequently build their confidence (Deans for Impact, 2015). By providing deliberate instructional support to make sure that these foundational concepts are well understood, you are giving your pupils the best chance of success. Again, the types of explicit teaching strategies outlined above will help.\n\nWhile schools might approach curriculum design in different ways, or have different visions for the education of pupils, carefully sequencing and staging what pupils need to know – and making clear links between new knowledge and prior learning – should be universal. You learned in Block 2 that pupils construct new knowledge and understanding based on what they already know (Roediger & Butler, 2011), and this is the case in all subjects. You will also remember that the way we mentally organise knowledge, joining new concepts to existing knowledge in increasingly complex mental models, is called schemata. If we are unable to connect new knowledge to existing information within our long-term memory, it is likely to be forgotten.\n\nFoundational concepts are particularly important in this regard as they make connections with lots of other concepts within the subject. For example, if a pupil already knows and understands that light can be turned into energy, grasping the process of photosynthesis can happen more quickly. When we introduce a new concept, we can help pupils to strengthen their existing schema in a subject by making explicit links to what they already know. Often this will be a core concept.\n\nOf course, you will already have seen that however carefully you think about how to present new concepts, pupils will end up with differing levels of understanding. This can be because they have different levels of prior knowledge of the subject and because pupils can and will connect new knowledge to previously learned misconceptions which can impede their learning (Guzzetti, 2011).\n\nWhatever the reason, every subject has its common misconceptions which some or all pupils will encounter. The good news is that as you gain experience as a teacher, you will become more and more adept at anticipating these misconceptions and addressing them in your teaching. This is an important element of curricular knowledge: the evidence shows that teachers with comparable levels of subject knowledge but with a better understanding of misconceptions in their subject have more impact on student outcomes (Coe et al., 2014).\n\nUntil you have developed this expertise – and even when you have – the key to dealing with misconceptions is to be proactive and address them in your planning. As a new teacher, this can be challenging. To a certain extent, the best way to understand what the misconceptions are in each topic or subject is to witness how pupils succeed or struggle. Therefore, this is an area where you should draw on the know-how of your more experienced colleagues. Before teaching a new area, you could ask:\n\n- What misconceptions might pupils already hold?\n- What do pupils typically misunderstand about this concept?\n- What common mistakes or errors do they make when applying the concept in practice?\n- Is there an alternative way of communicating this concept that will reduce the likelihood of misconceptions taking hold?\n- Who from my team or wider networks might have experience of teaching this content before and know common misconceptions?\n\nThere is a suggested activity in section 4.4 of these self-study materials to help you draw this type of information out from your colleagues. You will also do an activity with your mentor on how to identify the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles in your subject.\n\n## Secure subject knowledge allows pupils to think critically within the subject area\n\nWe want pupils to think hard about topics and to engage deeply with new knowledge. The research evidence shows that secure background knowledge is an important prerequisite for critical thinking to take place (Bailin et al., 1999).\n\nFor pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. Learning to think critically involves thinking about something. For example, you cannot think critically about the causes of the Second World War without first having a good knowledge of the events leading up to the war.\n\nBecause background knowledge is so important, it is also likely that pupils will struggle to transfer what they learn in one subject or discipline to another. For example, if a pupil practises evaluation of similar texts in English – with lots of initial guidance before the support is tapered and the underlying structure of what good evaluation looks like is pointed out – the pupil will get better at evaluating other similar texts. The specific nature of the critical thinking task here is unlikely to transfer easily to many other subjects or even other types of text.\n\nThere are many types of critical thinking tasks (such as comparing, classifying, judging) which are cognitively demanding but don’t aid schema building. Unless the background knowledge is secure, more complex critical thinking tasks may actually _detract_ from learning. In the examples below, Teacher A assumes that their pupils will be able to engage critically with a text in the same way as an expert (such as the teacher). Teacher B takes a different approach. Why is this more likely to be effective?\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  <b>Example A</b>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      A teacher wants pupils to read a historical source and to examine its\n      validity. \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher hands out the source at the start of the lesson and asks\n      pupils to complete the task.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupils read the source in small groups and prepare their ideas to share\n      with the group.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Each group shares with the class but their responses are not well\n      developed, focusing on things like how difficult it was to read the\n      handwriting and understand the language of Elizabethan writers.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n  <b>Example B</b>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Before the lesson, the teacher identifies that for pupils to be successful\n      analysing the usefulness of a text they need to know certain information\n      about the period.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher starts the lesson with a quick recall quiz on prior knowledge\n      linked to the period, including the names of people and important dates.\n      The teacher follows up with some targeted questions to check\n      understanding.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher explicitly models the skills needed when examining a source\n      for reliability, and together the class creates a checklist of questions\n      to ask such as: Who wrote the source?

Poor literacy also drives low\n  social mobility, since children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely\n  to start school with lower literacy skills.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  How can this situation be improved? There is a solid evidence base that\n  teachers and teaching methods can matter both for literacy… and for learning\n  outcomes more generally.\n</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Taken from Machin, McNally, &amp; Viarengo, 2018.\n  </span>\n</p>\n$I\n\nLanguage provides the foundation of thinking and learning. Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen in a way that lets us communicate effectively and make sense of the world (National Literacy Trust, 2020). Without good literacy skills, a pupil will struggle to access the curriculum and hence be unable to learn effectively. This might show itself as:\n\n- Difficulty following instructions\n- Poor comprehension when reading subject texts\n- Lack of fluency when reading aloud\n- Incoherent written or spoken explanations.\n\nThe long-term effects of weak literacy will impact a pupil far beyond school. At the everyday level, they will struggle with form filling, reading and understanding signs. The impact on their life chances can be profound, from limiting their career options and reducing their lifetime earning potential, through to poor health and lower life expectancy (Gilbert et al., 2018).\n\nThe task of improving pupils’ literacy skills starts from the very beginning of education and continues all through secondary school. Even though “learning to read” is perceived as a task for teachers in early primary, the reality is that every teacher, across all subjects and all phases, can and should think carefully how they can improve pupils’ literacy. For example, all primary teachers will need to reinforce the fundamental knowledge of word reading (decoding) and language comprehension. For most secondary teachers, improving pupils’ literacy will mainly involve thinking about how you can improve reading, writing and speaking skills in relation to your subject discipline.\n\nConsequently, it is important that all teachers have a clear understanding of the most effective ways to improve literacy. In terms of reading, the most effective approach is _systematic synthetic phonics._\n\n$I\n\n<h3>An introduction to phonics</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Phonics is a way of teaching children how to read and write. It helps children\n  hear, identify and use different sounds that distinguish one word from another\n  in the English language. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Written language can be compared to a code, so knowing the sounds of\n  individual letters and how these letters sound when they’re combined will help\n  children decode words as they read. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Understanding phonics will also help children know which letters to use when\n  they are writing words. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The most widely used approach associated with the teaching of reading in which\n  phonemes (sounds) associated with particular graphemes (letters) are\n  pronounced in isolation and blended together (synthesised). For example,\n  children are taught to take a single-syllable word such as cat apart to its\n  three letters, pronounce a phoneme for each letter in turn /k/, /æ/, /t/ and\n  blend the phonemes together to form a word.\n</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taken from, The National Literacy Trust</span>\n  <a href=\"about:blank\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      https://literacytrust.org.uk/information/what-is-literacy/what-phonics/\n    </span>\n  </a>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Therefore, </span>\n  <i>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">systematic</span>\n  </i>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    {\" \"}\n    synthetic phonics is an explicit, organised and sequenced approach, as\n    opposed to phonics used incidentally or on a “when-needed” basis (EEF,\n    2018).\n  </span>\n</p>\n$I\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\n“My turn, your turn”: synthetic phonics\n\n### Video Type\n\nTalking head and classroom practice\n\n### Short Description\n\nA teacher explaining what systematic synthetic phonics is and why it is effective in teaching pupils to decode\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How does the teacher break words down?\n- What do pupils need to do?\n- How might this be used with older children?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  [Pupils on the mat with their classroom teacher who has a whiteboard with a\n  picture of a sheep and the word spelled out]\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher: OK, we’re going to sound out this word, sh…eee...p...sheep.

Should we have a debate on whether to abolish taxes?). - Teacher provides opportunity for repeated practice of newly learned vocabulary in talk, writing and reading (e.g. pupils use the new vocabulary in their next task). | - Identify important vocabulary to teach explicitly, i.e that which pupils will encounter often or which are foundational to the subject. - Always provide lots of opportunities for pupils to use the new vocabulary, e.g. in sentence stems.

Knowing what words\n  mean ensures that pupils can comprehend meaning – the more words they know,\n  the more they will understand about a topic or be able to infer from a text. A\n  robust vocabulary supports all aspects of communication: listening, speaking,\n  reading and writing. There are some words which pupils will learn through\n  hearing them repeated often (such as “no” and “cat”) and others which will\n  need to be explicitly taught through systematic vocabulary instruction. We\n  call these tier 2 and tier 3 words.\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Tier 1: Words of everyday speech, familiar to most children. \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Tier 2: High-utility words likely to appear frequently in a wide variety\n      of contexts — instruction in these words can add significantly to a\n      pupil's language ability.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Tier 3: Low-frequency words, domain specific, most likely learned in a\n      subject context. \n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Examples</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Examples of tier 1 words are: book, hill, talk, cat, yellow. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Examples of tier 2 words are: evaluate, report, beneficial, hilarious,\n  pollution, impression. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Examples of tier 3 words are: ion, metamorphic, tectonic, omniscient,\n  continent. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The EEF report for secondary school teachers recommends that they should\n  prioritise teaching tier 2 and 3 vocabulary, which students are unlikely to\n  encounter in everyday speech.{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Choose which words you will explicitly teach in your subject or phase.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Remember that these are most likely to be tier 2 and tier 3 words because\n      they are more complex or subject specific and therefore less likely to be\n      acquired through oral language. \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      You should select these words when planning a lesson or sequence of\n      lessons so that you have time to plan how you will teach them.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  To do this you can use the robust vocabulary instruction in the table above.{\" \"}\n</span>\n$I\n\n## Video\n\nIn this video, the teacher is using the reciprocal reading technique from the table of approaches above. Some pupils may be expert decoders and therefore able to read fluently, but unable to comprehend the meaning of the text. This approach is helpful because it allows pupils to articulate their ideas aloud to a group, exposing where there is confusion or lack of comprehension. It makes explicit the metacognitive strategies that readers use for reading comprehension: predicting, summarising, questioning and clarifying.\n\nWatch this video of a teacher running a reciprocal reading group and consider the following questions:\n\n- How do the different roles of predict, clarify, summarise and question help the pupils with their reading comprehension?\n- How does the teacher manage the conversation and support reading comprehension?\n- How might this technique work in your subject?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<h3>\n  A Year 3 reading group, four students and one adult reading{\" \"}\n  <i>The Tiger Who Came to Tea.</i>\n</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher: “Before we start reading this book, Joe would you like to predict\n  what the text is about?

You should spend some time talking to colleagues and asking for advice. The following question stems might help you to do this:\n\n- “If you were teaching X, what would you want to make sure pupils knew before starting… ?”\n- “Where does X fit in the wider curriculum map? What comes before, what comes after?”\n- “What common misconceptions do pupils have within this topic?”\n- “I am going to be teaching X and am unsure what the most important things for pupils to think about are. Can you help?”\n- “When you taught X previously, how did you make sure that pupils were thinking about the most important thing?”\n- “What do pupils typically get wrong in this topic? How do you deal with this?”\n- \"How do you go about making sure that you provide enough time for repetition within your planning?\"\n- \"What kinds of activities have you found helpful for supporting pupils to practise critical skills and knowledge?\"\n\n#### Utilising subject associations\n\nSubject associations can be a useful source of information to develop your subject knowledge. Most of them have regular publications. Spend some time exploring the relevant one for you. [https://www.subjectassociations.org.uk/](about:blank)\n\n#### Utilising resources effectively\n\nYour department or phase team will be able to help you identify high-quality resources for your subject or phase. These might include:\n\n- Textbooks\n- Websites\n- Department/phase resource banks\n\nYou can use resources to improve your subject knowledge. Here are some things to consider:\n\n- How does this resource explain a particular concept?\n- What types of practice activities does it provide?\n- How do the examples in the resource address possible misconceptions?\n- What language does the resource use to explain key concepts and knowledge which pupils need to understand?\n- Are there any potential misconceptions which the resource has explicitly highlighted?\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad – reflect on your practice...</h2>● Which idea(s) for practice\ndid you try? ● What did you do? ● What happened? ● What will you do next? $CTA\n\n## Sequencing effectively\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\n#### Learn that:\n\n3.3 Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.\n\n3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.\n\n### Sequencing effectively will mean that you have…\n\n1. Pupils that are confident.\n2. Pupils who are clear on what they are doing and why they are doing it.\n3. Pupils who are able to make links to existing knowledge.\n\n### Practice...\n\n#### Working backwards\n\nDeciding what to put in your units of work (and even in individual lessons) is a challenging task. Approaching your planning by _starting at the end_ is an effective way to approach this task.\n\nFor example, imagine you are planning a unit of work on energy. Instead of starting with the topic and being overwhelmed by all the things you _could_ teach, begin by thinking about the end. Follow these steps, working backwards:\n\n1. What are the fundamental things (knowledge, concepts and skills) you want your pupils to take away from this unit? Therefore…\n2. What needs to be in the end of unit assessment to check the knowledge and skills have been taught?\n3. What do the individual aims and objectives need to be in the preceding lessons to support pupils to be successful in the end of unit assessment?\n4. In what ways will you check that pupils are on track within each lesson?\n5. Have you ordered your content from foundational to more complex to ensure pupils are more likely to build confidence and succeed?\n\nYou can use this approach for the design of individual lessons within the unit.\n\n1. What do I need my pupils to know by the end of this lesson in order to meet the overall aims and objectives?\n2. What do I need to provide input on for them to achieve this?\n3. What tasks/activities can I design around this input to check pupils have understood?\n4. How can I make sure pupils have connected this learning to what they have done before?\n\n#### C**onnecting the learning**\n\nReview your lesson plans for the next week. For each lesson, make sure your starter or “do now” activity is one which connects the learning of that lesson to the previous lessons. Some ideas for doing this are below:\n\n- Five quick questions: pupils answer five quick questions in their books or on mini-whiteboards based on the learning from the previous lesson.\n- Ask five questions: pupils have to write five questions about the previous lesson.\n- Unscramble key vocabulary: use key words from the previous lesson and scramble them up. Pupils need to unscramble the words, define them and then write a paragraph using as many of the words as possible.\n- Beat the teacher!: Write a paragraph based on the previous lesson but containing mistakes. Pupils need to find the mistakes and correct them.\n\n#### D**evelop a knowledge organiser**\n\nA knowledge organiser which outlines the essential knowledge required for a specific unit of work. It can support the learning of foundational concepts because:\n\n- It provides a reference point for pupils to continuously refer back to.\n- It provides the essential contextual knowledge (i.e. definitions and key words) required to access the learning.\n\nKnowledge organisers can be helpful for teachers as well as pupils – the process of developing a knowledge organiser can be an effective way for you to decide what the foundational knowledge/concepts in your subject or current topic are.\n\nAn example of a knowledge organiser for history:\n\n- A one-page document, including:\n\n  - Key dates\n  - Key vocabulary and definitions\n  - Key individuals\n  - Other pertinent information such as legislation relevant to the period being studied, e.g. The Elizabethan Poor Law.\n\nThe use of the organiser needs to be integrated into your lessons. For example:\n\n- Train the pupils in how to learn the material. Be explicit about the fact that learning information organised in different ways will help them to remember it.\n- Use it as an aid for homework, e.g. “Learn section 1 of your knowledge organiser for homework.” Test the pupils on the knowledge in the next lesson.\n- You can also use it to track whether pupils have secured the foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on, e.g. pupils highlight green when they have successfully learned an aspect.\n- Use it as an aid for retrieval within lessons.\n- The knowledge organiser needs to be presented in such a way that further organisation of it could take place by pupils.\n\nRead more about knowledge organisers here: <https://my.chartered.college/2019/05/organising-knowledge-the-purpose-and-pedagogy-of-knowledge-organisers/>\n\n#### **Reviewing and reflecting on a sequence of lessons**\n\nDedicating time to review and reflect upon lessons you teach will give you information which will help you become a better teacher. Take some time to carefully consider the way you sequenced your lessons. Ask yourself:\n\n- How well prepared was I to teach this sequence of lessons? (Did I do pre-reading? etc.) What would I do differently next time?\n- Did the way I sequenced the lessons work? Did the pupils acquire the fundamental knowledge, concepts and skills that I wanted them to by the end of the sequence? If not, why not? Would I change anything about the sequencing next time? Why?\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>\n  <b>In your</b> notepad<b> – reflect on your practice...</b>\n</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <b>\n      <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do next?</span>\n    </b>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp; $CTA\n\n## **Area 3: Explicit teaching of subject-specific knowledge and skills**\n\n### By trying this activity, you will...\n\n#### **Learn that:**\n\n3.5 Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.\n\n### If this is happening in your classroom, you will see...\n\n- Pupils who can connect what they are learning to prior learning.\n- Pupils who are clear on what they need to do.\n- Pupils who are able to give subject-specific explanations and examples.\n\n### Practice...\n\n#### **Reflecting on quality explicit teaching**\n\nAsk a peer or your mentor to observe you teaching. As an alternative, you could find a colleague to observe and time them. Ensure you are clear on the purpose of the observation and what you are there to do.\n\nKeep a note of when the teacher explicitly teaches the knowledge or skills pupils need. This might be through:\n\n- Quality explanations\n- Giving examples, modelling or using illustrations\n- Discussing or teaching vocabulary\n\nNote down:\n\n- What did the teacher do / say?\n- What resources / examples did they use?\n- What was the impact on the learning after the explicit teaching moment? How did it affect pupils learning?\n\nReflect on the following at the end of the lesson:\n\n- Was enough explicit input provided to pupils to help them succeed in the lesson? What evidence was there of this?\n- Were the explanations high-quality? How did they support pupils to understand the key concepts?\n- Were the examples of high quality? How did they support pupils in understanding the key concepts?\n- Did the teacher spend enough time on making sure pupils had the right subject-specific vocabulary to produce high-quality work? How did pupils demonstrate this during the lesson?\n- Did the explicit teaching support pupils to learn the lesson outcomes? Why/why not? What would the teacher do differently next time?\n\n#### Script an exposition for a topic you will teach\n\nChoose a lesson where you are going to have to teach pupils a concept that is challenging. Write a script for how you will introduce pupils to that concept. Use the following questions to support you to do so:\n\n1. What do my pupils already know about this topic?\n2. How can I use what my pupils already know to help them understand this new material?\n3. How can I make explicit how this new content builds on what they already know?\n4. Is my explanation clear and carefully constructed?\n5. Have I used pictures/diagrams/illustrations to support my explanation?\n6. What examples have I used to support my explanation? Are they high-quality?\n7. Are there any non-examples I could use?\n8. What misconceptions might my pupils have? How can I address these explicitly?\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  Here is an example script from a teacher who is going to teach her class about\n  metaphors for the first time. She has already taught them similes.\n</h3>\n“Today we are going to learn something new. By the end of this lesson, you are going\nto be able to tell me what a metaphor is and be able to use them. This builds on\nthe work we did already on similes.\n\nCan you now turn to your partner and remind them what a simile is and give an example. You have two minutes. [Pupils discuss with their partner while the teacher circulates and listens to conversations.] 3, 2, 1... thank you. Joseph, I liked what I heard you telling your partner, can you please share with the class. [Joseph shares with the class.]\n\nRemember, when we use a simile, we compare by saying something is <strong>like</strong> or <strong>as</strong> something else. For example, ‘you are as cold as ice’. Today, we are going to build on this knowledge to understand and be able to use metaphors.\n\nA metaphor is when you compare something by saying it <strong>is</strong> something else. Both these techniques are used by writers to pick out characteristics of the thing that we are describing to convey meaning to the reader and add depth to what we are describing; they help us to <strong>show, not tell</strong>. Here is an example of a metaphor: ‘He is a shining star.’\n\nCan you now turn to your partner and decide which of these is a metaphor and why: a. Hope makes me feel optimistic and positive about the future; b. Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul. You have one minute. [Pupils discuss with their partner while the teacher circulates and listens to conversations.] 3, 2, 1... thank you. Nadia, you and Rajib said b ‒ can you explain why?” [Nadia shares with the class.]\n$I\n\n#### Develop and use a bank of subject-specific examples for a topic\n\nTake a unit of work that you are going to teach soon. This may be a unit that you are planning from scratch or one that already exists. For each lesson consider:\n\n1. What are the key pieces of knowledge and skills that are being taught?\n2. What are the current examples being used to illustrate?\n3. Could these current examples be better (i.e. more relevant, more up to date)?\n4. How will I explain this example? Is there a diagram/picture/illustration that could support its explanation?\n\nExamples of knowledge and skills needed for different topics:\n\nBiology ‒ Respiration\n\n- To know that respiration is a cellular process\n- To know that during respiration the energy stored inside glucose is transferred\n- To know the difference between breathing and respiration\n- To be able to contrast respiration and fermentation\n\nPE – Basketball\n\n- To be able to dribble the ball\n- To be able to chest pass\n- To be able to bounce pass\n- To be able to pivot\n- To know the key rules of a basketball game\n\nIt would be useful to share your thoughts or ask questions of colleagues and also pupils to help you.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>\n  <b>In your</b> notepad<b> – reflect on your practice...</b>\n</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <b>\n      <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do next?</span>\n    </b>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "5e55d511-63fa-47ef-a547-3c995a2f2e62"],

But are they doing it well? What does it even mean to do assessment well? Why is feedback so important as part of the assessment cycle? How often and how detailed should your assessments and feedback be?\n\nGet it right and assessment and feedback can be a teacher's best friend. Formative assessment is one of the things research is most certain will improve learning, especially when combined with high-quality feedback. Get it wrong and it can be the bane of your life. Bad assessment practices are both pointless and time-consuming. It is easy to spend huge amounts of time setting and marking assessment that doesn’t tell you much. Equally, if you fail to deliver the feedback in a useful way it might not make any difference to pupil progress.\n\nThis Block will support you to establish what effective assessment and feedback practices are.\n\nWhen assessment is used well, it gives you critical information about what pupils are learning, what they understand and what additional support they need. For an assessment to be effective, it is important to be clear about the reasons you are assessing a pupil at any particular point. To do this, you need to develop an understanding of what good assessment looks like.\n\nAssessment can easily become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on your workload. To avoid this, it is important to work with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment. Good questioning in the classroom is also an easy and efficient way to assess learning. During this Block, we will provide you with ideas on how to do this in a practical way to ease the load.\n\nJust as you need the information from assessments to support you to adapt and improve your teaching, pupils need information from you in the form of feedback to help them improve their work. Within this Block we will explore what this looks like in practice, drawing on key evidence from research about what makes feedback effective in improving learning outcomes.\n\nYou may be feeling as though assessment and feedback is a demanding aspect of your teaching role, but through this Block you will understand that mastering assessment and feedback is the foundation of excellent teaching. When you know exactly where your pupils are in relation to where you want them to be, you can make informed decisions about how to adapt your teaching, what feedback to give pupils and what to plan next so that pupils improve more rapidly than they would otherwise.\n\nThere has been a lot written about the impact of assessment and feedback on workload in recent years, with a major benefit that we know more now than we ever have about which techniques are effective and sustainable for classroom teachers. This Block draws on all of this research to develop your practice.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "46644a6e-3ea8-4c24-be26-e761fb7e7375"],

They could certainly feel their way and depending on their previous experience and skill they might make it to the top. However, with a partner below to guide them, assessing where they were struggling and giving specific and useful steps to move them forward, they would be more likely to complete the wall. Good assessment and feedback in the classroom is like that from the climbing guide – you can see the whole picture, identify where your climbers (pupils) are stuck, give useful feedback to move them forward or offer alternative routes to get to the same destination.\n\nWhy do you need to think about assessment every day and not just at the end of term or end of topics?\n\nAssessment is so much more than just a record of what your pupils have learned. Although this will be an element of your classroom practice and a mechanism through which you can show pupils’ progress, ongoing assessment of what your pupils understand and what they need next is one of the most important things you can do as a teacher. This type of assessment, gathering information to inform what you teach and improve learning, is often known as _formative assessment._\n\nBased on a review of over 250 research articles from various countries, Black and Wiliam (2004) concluded that few initiatives in education have a stronger evidence base than formative assessment as a strategy for raising achievement.\n\nPupil assessment can be used to provide vital information to teachers about pupils’ learning. When used in this way, formative assessment is a crucial component of teaching, which has a positive impact on pupil learning (Black et al., 2004; Coe, 2013; Speckesser et al., 2018). It helps teachers decide:\n\n- What pupils are learning and their current understanding\n- How they should respond to pupils’ prior knowledge\n- What to do about pupil misconceptions\n- How and when to introduce new learning\n- What further support a pupil might need\n\n(Sadler, 1989; Harlen & James, 1997; Black et al., 2004;\nBlack & Wiliam, 2009; Christodoulou, 2017)\n\nOf course, this information is only useful if you do something with it. Adapting your teaching (something you explored in Block 3) and giving useful feedback to pupils so that they can improve their work is what makes “assessment and feedback two of the most important strategies that teachers use to support pupils’ learning.” (Hattie, 2017)\n\nUnfortunately, assessment and feedback are not always done well, as Professor Rob Coe has observed:\n\n$I\n\n<em>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    It is now a rare thing, in my experience, to meet any teacher in England who\n    would not claim to be doing [formative] Assessment... And yet, the evidence…\n    suggests that during the fifteen years of this intensive intervention to\n    promote [formative] Assessment, despite its near universal adoption and\n    strong research evidence of substantial impact on attainment, there has been\n    no (or at best limited) effect on learning outcomes nationally.\n  </span>\n</em>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coe (2013)</span>\n</p>\n$I\n\nWhy might this be? It’s unlikely to be down to teachers’ good intentions and effort, but it is easy to focus on the wrong things. If assessment fails to improve pupils’ learning, it has missed the point.\n\nSo, what is “good assessment” and what is “good feedback”?\n\n## Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear\n\nGood assessment will be absolutely clear on what it is looking for. It can be easy to be misled by the appearance of pupils in a calm and productive classroom. As we saw in Block 2, learning is something that happens inside pupils’ heads: the process is therefore invisible to an observer. Pupils need to think hard about material in order to learn it, and – from the outside – this can take many forms. Therefore, the fact that pupils look busy and engaged does not tell us what they have learned (Wiliam, 2010; Coe, 2013).\n\nPoor “proxies for learning” (Coe, 2013) are behaviours that we might observe in classrooms and automatically assume the learning we intended for our pupils is happening. For example, we might observe pupils highly engaged in an activity and make an assumption that the learning we planned has taken place. If your assessment of the success of your lesson was based on the extent to which pupils appeared to enjoy the task and the number who completed it, you would be missing vital information about whether your learning objectives had been achieved and what pupils had learned.\n\nConsider Pictures A, B and C below. Which pupils are “learning best”?\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Young school girl reading a book at the school library. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/kid1-1.jpg $EndURL $Caption Picture A $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Two students are laughing at the computer in class. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/kid2-1.jpg $EndURL $Caption Picture B $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Tired school boy with hand on face sitting at desk with classmates in classroom. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/kid3-1.jpg $EndURL $Caption Picture C $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nBy just looking at the pictures, you might make some assumptions about this – your assumptions might be true but they could also be wrong. Therefore, to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors we must **assess** learning through activities, homework and tests to objectively identify what pupils know, understand and can do.\n\n## Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use\n\nGood assessment will always have a clear purpose. There is a lot to do as a teacher and so prioritising your time on activities that help and support learning is essential. The research is clear that using formative assessment can help to improve outcomes. However, assessment can often be time-consuming and burdensome, with large amounts of unproductive data collection and analysis (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017; Gibson et al., 2015).\n\nTherefore, to reduce the time spent on assessment that does _not_ benefit pupil learning, before doing any assessment task you should be clear about:\n\n- What the assessment will be used to support\n- What information will be gained from the assessment activity\n- How the information gathered will be used\n\nTaken from Wiliam & Leahy (2015).\n\nYou make multiple decisions a day as a teacher, even multiple decisions during every lesson. Assessment should be used to support your decision making – what to teach and what not to teach. If you are carrying out an assessment task, you should be clear about the reason why. But what does this look like in practice?\n\nThe types of questions you might use assessment to answer could include:\n\n$I\n\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What do my pupils already know about this topic?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What difficulties do my pupils have with this concept/skill?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What expertise do my pupils have already related to this concept/skill?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Do my pupils have any misconceptions related to this concept/skill?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Have my pupils understood the key ideas we have been learning about?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Can I move onto the next step in the learning?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Can my pupils link ideas to work we have done previously?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have my pupils learned today?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How will I use the responses from pupils to inform my planning and\n      teaching?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher A is going to be starting a new topic on Henry VIII. Before she begins\n  teaching she wants to know how much her pupils know about the Tudors already\n  as some of them covered it in the previous year. Therefore, she will create an\n  assessment on Tudors. The purpose of this assessment will be to check prior\n  knowledge and work out pupil starting points. From talking to her colleagues,\n  she has established that another teacher has created a short multiple-choice\n  quiz about the Tudors. Teacher A decides to use this and adapt it to suit what\n  she wants to see if pupils know. Once pupils have completed this quiz, the\n  teacher will be able to clearly see the starting point of her pupils and will\n  be able to plan or adapt her lessons to draw on and develop this learning.\n</span>\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What is the purpose of the assessment?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How does the teacher draw on the support of colleagues?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nOne way of informing your assessment planning is to work with your colleagues to identify efficient and effective approaches to assessment.

After I marked a piece of work\nand handed it back, pupils would spend a couple of minutes looking at my feedback\n– but mainly focused on a mark or grade if I gave one – and then they would turn\nover onto a new page and we would start the next piece of work. They hardly ever\ndid anything with my comments and so I found myself writing out the same comments\nover and over again.\n\nI made a change a few years ago after speaking to a more experienced colleague who helped me to see that I wasn’t giving any real opportunity for pupils to actually respond to my feedback and so they considered it case closed. Now I think about assessment and feedback as one continuous loop – when I mark a piece of work I am assessing what pupils can do and what they need to do next, I provide feedback on this and then they have to have the opportunity to improve it so I can assess if they have moved forward. I like to give one essay title and pupils will submit maybe three to four drafts of the same essay to me over the term, each time improving the same essay based on the feedback they get. This helps both me and the pupils to see the progress they are making. It works really well and I no longer feel like my feedback is a waste of time, pupils actually use it to improve their work!\n\n<strong>Teacher 2:</strong> I often set my pupils a set of problems to solve to check\ntheir learning. I used to mark each individual pupil’s work and write out corrections\nand examples in each of their books, which took a really long time. Sometimes I would\ntake so long to mark the full set of books that we had moved on in the curriculum\nand the motivation for pupils to respond to the feedback was gone.\n\nI now use a much more efficient approach which means pupils get feedback a lot quicker so they can act on it and it still feels relevant to the learning we are doing. I first saw this approach at a subject network meeting and I’ve used it ever since – I mark pupils' work but I just put a code (like a square or a star) next to the questions they got wrong based on an error. I then prepare one slide or print out which has the code and a worked example/explanation of the mistake. For example, the star shows that pupils have made an error with their units in the problem. Pupils are all given a copy of the class feedback and they have time to correct their work. An unintended outcome, which I didn’t expect, was pupils have started to help each other and ask others in their group who didn’t get that code to help them if they are stuck! It’s led to some really meaningful responses to feedback and pupils take it really seriously.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve\n\nSo, feedback has to give pupils a chance to act on it. What else do we know about high-quality feedback? To support pupils’ learning, feedback does not have to be provided in writing by the teacher.\n\n$I\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feedback can be given:</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verbally</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      During, as well as after, lessons by the teacher or other experts (e.g.\n      teaching assistants, books or online sources)\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      With careful support and guidance, from pupil to pupil\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <i>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n  </i>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    (Black et al., 2004; Gibson et al., 2015; Education Endowment Foundation\n    (EEF), 2018; Mapplebeck &amp; Dunlop, 2019)\n  </span>\n</p>\n$I\n\nHigh-quality feedback, whether it is written or verbal, needs to:\n\n- Be accurate and clear\n- Encourage further effort\n- Provide specific guidance on _how_ to improve\n\nHigh-quality feedback is explicit about what is involved in achieving success in a task _and_ what pupils need to do to improve (Sadler, 1989; Hattie, 2009). It has a positive impact on learner outcomes by providing specific, actionable guidance for pupils to improve their learning (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996; Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Hattie, 2014; EEF, 2018).\n\n## Feedback should:\n\n| Be accurate and clear                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Encourage further effort                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Provide specific guidance                                                                                                        |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| - Clear, simple language - Clarify learning intentions and criteria for success - Be linked to the learning goal they are working towards - Outline what success looks like - Be clear on how pupils will know when they have got there | - Praise pupils for the parts that were done well - Ask pupils to do something further to their work - Highlight approaches that helped pupils to be successful, which they could use in other tasks: over time this can support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning | - Provide clear actions to further improve their work - Provide further scaffolding (e.g. examples) or challenge (e.g. now try…) |\n\nDone well, verbal feedback from teacher to pupil in class has the dual benefit of being both effective _and_ efficient. As it is given in the moment it also reduces “waiting time” between the mistake or error and the feedback the pupil receives. This means teachers are able to respond quickly with additional support to individuals as appropriate (Black et al., 2004; Gibson et al., 2015) and there is less chance of the pupil repeating the mistake and therefore reinforcing it.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nLive marking\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher sets a written task and, as pupils are working, circulates and offers feedback\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\nWhen pupils are doing a written task, it can be useful to walk around the room and offer verbal and written feedback.

Written feedback is still a common way for teachers to communicate with their pupils. A recent focus on effective marking from the EEF (2016) makes some recommendations emerging from the evidence, which could aid teachers when thinking about effective, sustainable approaches to marking:\n\n- Careless mistakes should be marked differently to errors resulting from misunderstandings. The former should just be marked as incorrect with no right answer supplied, the latter addressed through hints or questions, which lead pupils to the underlying principles.\n- Awarding grades for every piece of work takes away from the impact of marking as pupils can become obsessed by the grade at the expense of formative comments.\n- Using targets to make marking as specific and actionable as possible is likely to increase pupil progress.\n- Pupils are unlikely to benefit from written feedback unless time has been set aside to respond to it.\n- Acknowledgement marking (e.g. ticking every page) is unlikely to promote better progress. You would be better to mark fewer pieces but mark them in more detail.\n\n(Adapted from the EEF, A marked improvement?\nA review of the evidence on written marking, 2016.)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Have a look at the different examples of feedback given below and answer the\n  questions:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which feedback do you think is the best example of written feedback?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Do any of the examples meet all three of our criteria for good feedback\n      by:\n    </span>\n    <ul>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being accurate and clear</span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encouraging further effort</span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          Providing specific guidance on how to improve? \n        </span>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How might you improve the quality of the feedback?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$I\n\n<h2>Example A</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7/10.

We use them a lot – questioning is the most widely used form of teacher-pupil interaction (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). Significantly, more effective teachers “ask a large number of questions and check the responses of all students” (Rosenshine, 2012). Rosenshine’s research findings concluded that “the most successful teachers in these studies spent more than half the time lecturing, demonstrating, and asking questions” (ibid).\n\n$I\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  Questions allow a teacher to determine how well the material has been learned\n  and whether there is a need for additional instruction. The most effective\n  teachers also ask students to explain the process they used to answer the\n  question, to explain how the answer was found. Less successful teachers ask\n  fewer questions and almost no process questions.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Rosenshine (2012)</p>\n$I\n\nThinking back to what you learned in Block 2 about memory, you already know that learning happens when we are able to connect new knowledge to prior knowledge and present new concepts in easy to understand steps. Questions support both of these things. We can use them to check what pupils already know. We can use them to check that pupils are following our explanations and are ready for us to move on. And where they don’t understand, we can use questions to break these problematic concepts down further. They can also encourage pupils to think hard – a key factor in learning. With our prompting, pupils can be encouraged to articulate their understanding of key ideas, summarising and reformulating them in order to reinforce their knowledge.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case study – using questions</h3>\nIn one classroom-based experimental study, one group of teachers was taught to follow\nthe presentation of new material with lots of questions. They were taught to increase\nthe number of factual questions and process questions they asked during this guided\npractice. Test results showed that their students achieved higher scores than did\nstudents whose teachers did not receive the training.\n\n<strong>Factual questions:</strong> Tests pupils on their knowledge of key information,\nthese questions have one correct answer. “What date did World War One begin?” “What\nis 3x5?” “What is one stage of the water cycle?”\n\n<strong>Process questions:</strong> Tests pupils on their depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding. They require analysis/opinion from the pupil. “How does the reader\nfeel about Lennie at this point in the novel?” “What is the best way to solve this\nproblem? How do you know?” “Can you compare the way colour is used in these pictures?”\n\nImaginative teachers have found ways to involve all students in answering questions. Examples include having all students:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Tell the answer to a neighbour</li>\n  <li>\n    Summarise the main ideas in one or two sentences, writing the summary on a\n    piece of paper and sharing this with a neighbour, or repeating the\n    procedures to a neighbour\n  </li>\n  <li>Write the answer on a card and then hold it up</li>\n  <li>\n    Raise their hands if they know the answer (allowing the teacher to check the\n    entire class)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Raise their hands if they agree with the answer that someone else has given\n  </li>\n</ul>\nAcross the classrooms that the researchers observed, the purpose of all these procedures\nwas to provide active participation for the students and also to allow the teacher\nto see how many students were correct and confident. The teacher may then reteach\nsome material when it was considered necessary. An alternative was for students to\nwrite their answers and then trade papers with each other.\n\nOther teachers used choral responses to provide sufficient practice when teaching new vocabulary or lists of items. This made the practice seem more like a game. To be effective, however, all students needed to start together, on a signal. When students did not start together, only the faster students answered.\n\nIn addition to asking questions, the more effective teachers facilitated their students’ rehearsal by providing explanations, giving more examples, and supervising students as they practised new material.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Rosenshine (2012)</p>\n$I\n\n## The section that follows describes some of the key types of questions and how they can be used to achieve these goals\n\n### 1. Open versus closed questions\n\nIn broad terms, we can think of two main types of questioning: closed questions and open questions. When teachers ask a question with a relatively straightforward answer such as, “In the novel, did George shoot Lennie?”, this is considered a closed question. An open question typically elicits longer responses where students need to reflect and use more complex reasoning, such as “Was George justified in shooting Lennie?”. While it may be tempting to think that open questions are “better” than closed questions, both play an important role in the overall learning process.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Closed and open questions</h3>\n<strong>Closed questions</strong> can be useful for checking recall of facts or\nto check simple understanding. They can be asked at pace and keep pupils focused\non the lesson.\n\n<strong>Open questions</strong> allow for more developed responses and can be used\nto check that pupils' correct answers stem from a secure understanding. They enable\npupils to explain their thinking and explore what they know and understand. $I\n\nConsider these questions:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Three speech bubbles containing the following questions:&lt;p>&lt;/p>a) has everybody understood&lt;p>&lt;/p>b) Charles Dickens wrote Great Expectations in 1860.

They might say they have understood even if they haven’t.\n- Closed questions can be used to scaffold pupils’ learning by providing clues to the answer, as in **Example B**.\n- **Example C**, an open question, allows the teacher to assess what pupils have understood and what they have not.\n\nOther starting points for open questions include:\n\n- How can you explain…?\n- Why do you think…?\n- Why does this…?\n- What would you add to the previous answer?\n- What do you think would happen if…?\n- How could we find out…?\n- What did you mean when you said…?\n- Tell me more about…?\n- How do you know that…?\n- Why did you choose…?\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nClosed and open questions\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA Year 8 English teacher poses several closed and open questions.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\nAs you watch the video below, count how many closed or open questions were asked in the lesson segment.

Hinge questions\n\nWe often want to assess whether pupils understand a key idea before we move on. When this is the case, we can use a hinge question. These are questions that reliably check pupils’ knowledge or understanding and quickly give teachers information to decide whether and how to move on with the topic being taught.\n\nHinge questions often take the form of multiple-choice questions. Multiple-choice questions are a great way to check pupils' knowledge and understanding and identify misconceptions. However, they need careful planning, so that they:\n\n- Do not allow pupils to get the right answers for the wrong reason; i.e. pupils should not be able to guess or work out the correct answers because of the way the question is written, they should only be able to get the correct answers based on their understanding of the concept.\n- Ensure every option in the question provides the teacher with valuable evidence of pupils’ thinking – if pupils get the wrong answer, it tells the teacher something very important.\n- Are written to focus on “troublesome” knowledge, i.e. things that pupils are known to find difficult or common misconceptions that pupils may hold.\n- Indicate both correct thinking and gaps in pupils’ knowledge or misconceptions.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Hinge question examples</h3>\n<h4>1. Science</h4>\nIn which part of a daffodil does photosynthesis occur?\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n  <li>All of the daffodil</li>\n  <li>The leaves and petals</li>\n  <li>The leaves and roots</li>\n  <li>The leaves and stem</li>\n  <li>Just the leaves</li>\n</ol>\nPhotosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, which are found in green leaves and\nstems of plants. Pupils will need to understand that this is not restricted to\nthe leaves (E) and that petals and roots do not contain chloroplasts (B/C).\n<h4>2. French</h4>\nWhich of these translations is/are correct for the text below? L’été dernier, ma\nsœur avait un petit job donc elle est restée chez nous.\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n  <li>Last summer, my sister had a small job so stayed at our house.</li>\n  <li>Last summer, my sister had a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>\n  <li>Last summer my sister had a job, therefore she stayed at ours.</li>\n  <li>This summer, my sister has a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>\n  <li>This summer, my sister had a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>\n</ol>\nThe correct answer here is B – Last summer, my sister had a part-time job so\nstayed at our house. This checks that pupils have a good understanding of tense\n(this is in the past) so “last summer” not “this summer”. It checks that pupils\nunderstand that \"chez nous\" means “our house”. It also checks that “petit job”\nis understood as a part-time job as opposed to the literal translation of a\nsmall job.\n<h4>3. History</h4>\nWhich of these pairs of dates in ordinary numerals and Roman numerals is/are\ncorrect?\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n  <li>1996 – MCMXCVI</li>\n  <li>1332 – MCCCXXXII</li>\n  <li>1514 – MDXVI</li>\n  <li>2019 – MIIXIX</li>\n</ol>A and B are correct. 1514 is actually 1516, which checks that pupils\nunderstand that a I before a V means 4 whereas a I coming after a V means 6. The\nlast one is incorrect as it uses MII instead of MM. $I\n\nHinge questions can be used before, during or following exposition. Pupils may respond verbally, in writing, or through an action or activity of some kind, through individual or whole class responses, for example on whiteboards, on paper, using technology or using hand signals.\n\nFor example, with the questions above, the teacher could ask pupils to raise their hands when the teacher says the correct answer. If they don’t want pupils to copy others’ answers, they could ask pupils to close their eyes while answering or answer electronically.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nHinge questions\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nTeacher asks pupils hinge questions and gets responses.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\nHinge questions can be a useful way to quickly assess pupil understanding.\nHow does the teacher use hinge questions?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nNARRATION\n\nHinge questions are questions which reliably check pupils’ knowledge or understanding and quickly give teachers information to decide whether and how to move on with the topic being taught.\n\nThey can be used before, during or following exposition.

Follow-on questions\n\nWe can scaffold, extend or challenge pupils’ thinking by reframing questions. One way to do this is to use follow-on questions. The type of follow-on question, and how much guidance it offers to pupils, will depend on pupils' knowledge and understanding.\n\nFor pupils who need more support, more scaffolding is appropriate and the form is more likely to be a closed question; for those who need further stretch, we can ask open questions that encourage them to explore their answers further or respond to each other’s answers.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example: Forces</h3>\nPupils are going to be studying the topic “forces” and learning how balanced and\nunbalanced forces affect an object. This learning will then be built on to develop\nan understanding about Newton’s laws of motion, with quantitative approaches to calculating\nanswers taught last.\n\nThe teacher has planned a series of questions to use: some are to scaffold the necessary knowledge needed; other questions are to stretch the pupils' thinking by getting them to explain, analyse, apply and link ideas.\n\n<h4>Questions that scaffold knowledge</h4>\n<ul\n  class=\"rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write list…\"\n>\n  <li>What is a force?</li>\n  <li>What forces can you name?</li>\n  <li>How are forces measured?</li>\n  <li>How are forces represented?</li>\n  <li>What must be present on any force arrow to help describe a force?</li>\n  <li>How many objects must be present for a force to act?</li>\n  <li>Give me one example of a contact force.</li>\n  <li>Give me one example of a non-contact force.</li>\n  <li>Where do contact forces act on an object?</li>\n  <li>Where do non-contact forces act on an object?</li>\n  <li>What is a resultant force?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Questions that stretch thinking</h4>\n<ul\n  class=\"rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write list…\"\n>\n  <li>Where are the forces acting on a moving car?</li>\n  <li>Explain the motion of an object when forces are balanced.</li>\n  <li>Explain the motion of an object when forces are unbalanced.</li>\n  <li>\n    In this picture what would be the motion of the moving car?

Write three scaffold\nquestions and three stretch questions. $CTA\n\n## High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary\n\n$I\nOf all the debates in education one of the most contentious is the amount of time teachers should spend talking versus the amount of time students should spend talking. Research in this field is notoriously tricky; it is very difficult to grasp the import of spoken work with all its complexities and nuances.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Lemov &amp; Robinson (2017)</p>\n$I\n\nWhile there are interesting arguments about the type and quantity of “talk” that is optimal in classrooms – you will see very different dynamics in different schools for example – at a basic level pupils “need to practise new material. The teacher’s questions and student discussion are a major way of providing this necessary practice” (Rosenshine, 2012). Beyond this there are a number of other benefits that high-quality classroom talk can deliver, providing pupils with the opportunity to:\n\n- Practise using new vocabulary in full sentences and in different contexts\n- Articulate their ideas, thoughts or feelings\n- Explore and consolidate a new idea or topic through dialogue\n- Expand and deepen their understanding of a concept\n- Learn social skills such as having a conversation, taking turns, making a point and responding to other alternative viewpoints\n\n$I\nThe most recent large scale study on classroom talk carried out by the Cambridge Primary Review Trust and the University of York funded by EEF found that “dialogic teaching”, where teachers were trained on strategies which enabled pupils to “reason, discuss, argue and explain rather than merely respond, in order to develop high order thinking and articulacy”, found on average, students gained an additional two months’ learning compared to groups who did not receive the intervention.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Lemov &amp; Robinson (2017)</p>\n$I\n\nSo perhaps the key question then is: what makes classroom talk “high quality”?\n\nRobin Alexander, a well-known proponent of dialogic teaching (2004), distinguishes five central elements of effective classroom talk as being “collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative and purposeful.”\n\n| Element of classroom talk | What does it look like in the classroom?

- The talk should be well planned, including protocols such as how to contribute, length of time for the discussion and what happens next. - The teacher plays an important role to skillfully manage any classroom talk and keep it focused on the purpose intended – this might include giving sentence stems or facilitating the discussion. |\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\nAlexander, R.

(e.g. Were they all sitting together? Did they get a particular intervention?)\n  - What do you need to do to support those pupils who have not yet made progress?\n\n#### Use externally validated resources\n\nSummative assessments, like SATs, GCSEs and A levels, give a snapshot of pupils’ performance at a specific point in time. Summative assessment can evaluate pupil learning and provide evidence of their achievement. These assessments can also be used formatively, to provide feedback which helps pupils to improve.\n\nFor summative assessments to be most useful, they should be standardised, carefully developed and tested, implemented in controlled conditions, and assess the learning you want to find out about. You may be able to access sample and past assessments from awarding organisations for external examinations. These assessments have been carefully tested for reliability and validity and are often accompanied by reports which help teachers to understand common errors and misconceptions.\n\n**Think about an upcoming series of lessons in which you would like to assess pupils’ learning and work through the questions here.\n**\n\n- Is there an externally validated or widely used in-school assessment that I can use? If not, what task can I use instead?\n- Does the task test the understanding or knowledge I want to assess?\n- Will all pupils be able to understand the language used in the task?\n- Will pupils respond to the task in the same way?\n- Will the task give me reliable information: if the class did it again on another day would they get different outcomes?\n- If another teacher’s class did the task would their results be comparable?\n- Is the mark scheme clear and can I use it to help pupils understand their marks?\n- Should the task be carried out in class, under controlled conditions, with open books, or at home?\n- How much time should be given?\n- Should I mark the task, or could it be peer-assessed, self-assessed or assessed by a colleague?\n- How will I prepare the pupils for the task?\n\nIf you teach a subject in secondary school at GCSE or A-level, there are many externally validated assessments that can be used in the form of past papers.\n\n- You should search the exam board that your pupils are sitting their exam in.\n- You should speak to colleagues in your department about how they use these resources.\n- Some of the exam board sites require logins – your school can organise this for you.\n\nFor example:\n\n[GCSE | English Language | Assessment resources](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/english/gcse/english-language-8700/assessment-resources)\n\nEdexcel past papers on a range of topics KS4 and 5 (Account required): [Past papers | Past exam papers](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/exams/past-papers.html)\n\n**[GCSE - Geography B (Geography for Enquiring Minds) (9-1) - J384 (from 2016)](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse/geography-b-geography-for-enquiring-minds-j384-from-2016/assessment/) (Login required)**\n\n#### Practise summative assessments in controlled conditions\n\n- In order to increase the reliability and validity of summative assessments, efforts should be made to do these in controlled conditions which are replicated.\n- Your school may have a policy on this which you can look at.\n\nFor example:\n\n- How will pupils enter the classroom?\n- What will they be allowed on their desks?\n- Will there be complete silence for the whole lesson? What happens if a pupil does not adhere to this?\n- What should pupils do when they think they have finished?\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <b>\n      <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do next?</span>\n    </b>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Area 2: Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\n#### Learn how to: Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding, by:\n\n- 4m Including a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (e.g. by modelling new vocabulary or asking pupils to justify answers).\n- 4n Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required.\n\n### If this is successful, you will see…\n\n- Questions being asked from pupils to teacher and pupils to pupils.\n- Pupils are confident to air their thinking.\n- Pupils are confident to make mistakes and being encouraged to do so.\n- Questioning that builds on previous knowledge.\n- Activities that engage all pupils in talking and responding to the question.\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Pose-pause-pounce\n\n- Teacher poses a question, e.g. _“Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport, how much about the past could we find out about?”_\n- Teacher pauses while pupils have thinking time or paired discussion, e.g. _“Discuss what you are thinking with your partner.”_ They might pay attention to the talk between pupils.\n- Teacher pounces on a pupil/group to see what they think e.g. _“So what does this group think?” _or_ “I think I like what you’re talking about here, can you explain that to me?”_\n\nBounce the idea round the room asking pupils to build or challenge on what’s already been said, e.g. _“This group has said something really interesting. Ollie, can you explain? What does everyone else think about that? Eliza, do you agree with Ollie? Does anyone disagree?”_\n\n#### Use follow up questions\n\nIf pupils supply you with responses that could do with a greater level of elaboration and/or sophistication, instead of accepting the response, you can add a follow up question to their answer so that they are challenged to go beyond their initial thinking.\n\nFor example:\n\nTeacher:_ What did you put for the answer to 4c?_\n\nPupil: _I put 244._\n\nTeacher:_ Thank you, how did you arrive at that answer?_\n\nIn the next lesson you teach, try to do this five times.\n\n#### Use increased wait time\n\nIncrease the wait time you give pupils after you have asked your question. It takes practice to feel confident not filling the silence but if you do, pupils will know that if they dawdle, they won’t have to answer a question.\n\nOne way to practise achieving a longer wait time is to count down in your head slowly from 10 to 1. Tell pupils you will be doing this and ask them not to put their hands up until the end of their thinking time.\n\nIt could also be helpful to ask a peer or your mentor to observe you and to time how long you actually wait for pupils to respond.\n\nIn the next lesson you teach, use a stopwatch/timer to practise ensuring that you provide adequate wait time for pupils.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Which idea(s) for practice did you try?</li>\n  <li>What did you do?</li>\n  <li>What happened?</li>\n  <li>What will you do next?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Area 3: Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\n#### Learn how to: Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons, by:\n\n- 6d Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions.\n- 6e Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).\n- 6f Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.\n- 6g Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions.\n\n### If this is successful, you will see…\n\n- Pupils are clear on what they have done well.\n- Pupils are clear on what specifically they need to do next in order to improve.\n- Pupils want to improve their work.\n- Pupils are not disheartened if their work needs improvement.\n- Pupils considering improvement as part of the learning experience.\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Multiple-choice quiz\n\nFor a lesson you have coming up, develop a multiple-choice quiz that you could use at the beginning of the lesson to check for prior knowledge – this can include the security of that knowledge.\n\nFor example, the teacher has taught one lesson in a sequence of lessons on the Battle of Hastings. He uses the following multiple-choice questions to test pupils' knowledge as they go into lesson 2.\n\n1. _Why might Harold’s army have been tired before the Battle of Hastings?_\n\n   - They had recently fought Harald Hadrada.\n   - They had recently fought King Cnut.\n   - They had recently fought William Duke of Normandy.\n\n2. _What other reason did Harold’s army have for being tired?_\n\n   - They had marched to and from London Bridge.\n   - They had marched to and from Stamford Bridge.\n   - They had marched to and from Severn Bridge.\n\n3. _What advantages did William’s army have ahead of the battle?_\n\n   - They were a large army of mostly amateur soldiers.\n   - They arrived early and positioned themselves atop Senlac Hill.\n   - They were well equipped with horses and weapons.\n\n#### 5 quick questions/If this is the answer, what’s the question?\n\nFor a lesson you have coming up, develop a series of 5 quick questions you could ask to check for pupils' prior knowledge.\n\nFor example, taking the same history lesson as above:\n\n1. Who had Harold fought ahead of the Battle of Hastings?\n2. Where did this battle take place?\n3. What other reason did Harold’s army have for being tired before the Battle of Hastings?\n4. Name one advantage William had over Harold.\n5. Name another.\n\nAnother way you could do this is: **If this is the answer, what is the question? **In this activity, you provide the pupils with the answers, and they need to devise the questions. Pupils typically find this a more difficult activity because it requires a greater depth of understanding in order to construct the question. For example:\n\n1. Harald Hadrada\n2. Stamford Bridge\n3. They had to march all the way to and from Stamford Bridge and then to Hastings.\n4. His army had very good weapons.\n5. His army had horses.\n\n#### Live marking\n\n- Set an activity for your pupils.\n- While pupils are working, circulate and review what pupils are doing, offering feedback to each pupil that identifies a clear action for improvement.\n- Give pupils time to improve their work based on your feedback.\n- You could also use marking codes here if pupils are familiar with them, e.g. tick for something correct, circle for something that needs to be corrected.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Which idea(s) for practice did you try?</li>\n  <li>What did you do?</li>\n  <li>What happened?</li>\n  <li>What will you do next?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "35e7f13a-d511-41d3-8c36-3238a143d383"],

that high-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils' life chances; the progress you have made as an effective teacher, and continue to make, will support your pupils long after they leave your classroom. Some of your pupils have very specific needs such as special educational needs, others need additional support to overcome disadvantage; all should be treated as individuals who will learn and can achieve success if they are given the right support. Teachers can support all pupils to experience success; we can influence pupils’ resilience and their beliefs about their own ability. This can be done by seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers, and by working with families and colleagues to better understand pupils' individual circumstances. How we as teachers work with other people is a really important part of our roles.\n\nThis Block will help you develop your work with other professionals to achieve the best outcomes for children. It will look at how a culture of mutual trust and respect supports you to build effective relationships with parents, carers and families and help you to understand how these relationships can be used to improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.\n\nSchools are unique communities that offer a wide range of opportunities for pupils and staff. You may be starting to feel an integrated member of the school community, with your own networks of colleagues and classes who you have come to know well. Now is a good time to think about how you can contribute further and benefit from taking part in more aspects of school life. It is also the perfect time to reflect on how you might further develop strategies next year to manage your workload and wellbeing and think about who else you might want to build relationships with to support this goal.\n\nThis Block builds on everything you have learned so far about effective classroom practice, subject knowledge, assessment and feedback, curriculum planning and adaptive teaching. Throughout this year you have been seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, as an essential part of teaching. Have you done this effectively? What impact has it had? Have you used the knowledge of other people involved in each pupil’s learning, including parents?\n\nNow is a time to look back at your first year and reflect on the interactions you have had, and the relationships you have built with pupils, with families and with other professionals, such as your SENCO and Teaching Assistants. How have these interactions helped pupils’ learning? This might have been through supporting you to improve your pedagogical and subject knowledge, or through adapting your teaching to pupils’ individual needs. It is also a good opportunity to look forward to how you will continue to build these relationships to support your practice and improve pupil learning.\n\nYou will be supported to develop your knowledge and understanding of these key areas through the self-directed study material you find here on the portal. You will also have opportunities to discuss key ideas and deepen your understanding with colleagues and peers. Finally, you will work with your mentor to integrate your learning from theory into practice.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "50724100-3418-44cb-b372-7e093883c763"],

Building relationships with other people, including pupils, colleagues, parents, carers and other specialist professionals, is key to the job. Relationships matter and we can build and nurture these proactively.\n\nAs we saw in Block 1, teaching has an important social element, which involves relating to and interacting with pupils. Positive relationships between teachers and pupils are associated with better educational outcomes (Allen et al., 2011; Wubbels et al., 2014; PISA, 2015; Valdebenito et al., 2018).\n\nThere are of course other adults involved in a pupil’s education. You will know this is particularly true for pupils with special educational needs who may interact with multiple different adults on a daily basis. Developing effective relationships with colleagues helps teachers to improve their practice and contribute to the school community, whilst relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success. These relationships are most effective when built on a culture of mutual trust and respect. We will explore this further later in the Block.\n\nIn this activity, we focus on working with the other adults who have relationships with the pupils you teach. These include parents, carers and families, and teaching assistants, pastoral leaders and other professionals. There is a specific section on working with your SENCO later in this Block.\n\n## Effective relationships with parents, carers and families\n\nParents, carers and families have a significant influence on pupils’ education. As Hattie states, “parents can have a major effect in terms of the encouragement and expectations that they transmit to their children” (Hattie, 2009). You can play a direct role in this through actively seeking to engage the parents, carers and families of individual pupils.\n\nBy this point, you may have already seen the impact of building positive relationships with parents and carers. Together, you can mutually improve pupil motivation, behaviour and academic success.\n\nYour school will have its own communications policy and agreed ways for communicating with parents and carers. As a teacher, you should seek ways to reach out to families proactively. A useful way to establish these relationships is by engaging with parents, carers and families to support their children’s learning. Some ideas for doing this are exemplified in the following video.\n\n## Video\n\n### **Title**\n\nCommunicating with parents, carers and families\n\n### **Video type**\n\nTalking head\n\n### **Short description**\n\nTeachers explaining specific ways that they help parents, carers and families to support their children’s learning.\n\n### **Guidance**\n\nOpening up a dialogue with parents, carers and families can support pupil learning.\n\n- What specific ways do the teachers make contact with pupil families?\n- Keeping workload in mind, which ways are easier than others?\n- Are there any that you could use with your classes?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/0b4RDtVAa0o)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  When I start with my new class I know that building a relationship with the\n  parents and carers is really important.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  Being a primary school, lots of our parents still drop their kids off or\n  collect them at the end of the day so I make a point of standing outside to\n  say hello and make the initial connection. I keep a list of pupils in my\n  pocket so I tick off when I have met each parent or carer, and any that I\n  haven’t met within the first few weeks I will give a quick call to say hello\n  and introduce myself. I think it is important that families feel they can\n  speak to me if they need to – some of our parents are difficult to engage and\n  so a friendly first impression helps a lot.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  We have a policy of emailing home schemes of work and information about what\n  we will be learning each half term. I find this is a really great way to\n  communicate with families and I always include suggestions of activities which\n  they can do with their children – simple stuff in the home or local area but\n  also ideas of websites or books which would support the theme or topic we are\n  doing.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  Our school parent afternoons tend to be quite early in the year – this is so\n  we have a chance to sit down formally with each family and speak properly with\n  them about their child. Almost every parent or carer I have ever met is\n  delighted to talk about their child and how they can help them with their\n  learning. I like to host these in my classroom so they can see where their\n  child is all day, examples of their work on display and it is a quiet space so\n  they can raise any worries or concerns. I always follow up with a quick email\n  to say thank you and it was nice to meet you. It’s a simple thing but it shows\n  that I am open to continuing the dialogue and we are working together to\n  support their child.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  I do sometimes use text messages – parents sign up to this at the start of the\n  year to say they are happy to receive information this way. I tend to use\n  texts for reminders or quick praise messages as they are short and easy to\n  send. Parents seem to like it.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n  One other thing I do to get to know parents and carers is ask the pupils. I do\n  a ‘getting to know you’ activity when I first meet my class - they tell the\n  class about who they live with and maybe some things like how they travel to\n  school or who picks them up after school. This is always fun and I like being\n  able to ask parents about their e-scooters or how their elderly relative who\n  lives with them is doing.\n</p>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What specific action does the first teacher take to build relationships\n      with the parents and carers of their class?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What impact do you think this would have?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$CTA\n\nKeep in mind that high-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils' life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The work you do building relationships and learning about a pupil’s individual circumstances will positively influence your practice as you will be able to effectively plan and adapt your teaching to suit the individual needs of your pupils.\n\n## **Working with teaching assistants**\n\nTeaching assistants (TAs) are a valuable resource in schools. When deployed and trained effectively, TAs can have a positive impact on pupil attainment and engagement, as well as reducing classroom disruption and allowing teachers more time to teach (Blatchford et al., 2009; Education Endowment Foundation, 2015). TAs can also provide benefits to pupils with special educational needs when they are appropriately supported to do so (Carroll et al., 2017).\n\nA TA’s role is different to that of the teacher. You should work together respectfully but remember that as the teacher, you should take the lead. For a TA to be most effective, they should work as part of a team with the teacher, so that they supplement the teacher’s work rather than replace it. It is your role to prepare and brief the TA about individual lessons. TAs are often able to spend more time than teachers getting to know the pupils they work with, so they have knowledge that can be used in planning (Carroll et al., 2017).\n\nSupport staff may work more closely with SEND learners and in particular those who have an EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan). There is sometimes a risk that students can become over reliant on the support they receive from a TA. You should work with TAs to create strategies and provide opportunities for pupils to work as independently as possible, which can have a positive impact on longer term outcomes.\n\nThere can be a temptation to allow TAs to support pupils with more complex additional needs while your focus remains on the rest of the class group. Students with SEND benefit greatly from high-quality input and the expertise of teachers and we must ensure that pupils with additional needs receive a healthy diet of time and input from the teacher and TA in their classroom.\n\nTeacher quality matters most for the most vulnerable pupils. Teachers who are more effective overall tend to be even more effective at improving outcomes for pupils with low prior attainment, from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with behavioural difficulties.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>Try this</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Over the course of the week keep a log as to how much time you as teacher and\n  your TA spend with SEND learners.

Developing effective working relationships with these colleagues is a way you can make a positive contribution to the wider life of the school, helping to create a sense that as a community of professionals you are working together to improve the lives of all pupils. Working with other staff in school can also lead to positive effects on teachers’ job satisfaction and decreases in stress and workload (Blatchford et al., 2009). Support staff and other specialist colleagues have valuable expertise, which you can draw on and learn from to help you improve your teaching, whether this is working with particular pupils or developing your teaching.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The SENCO is in a classroom $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-6.2.1-Staff-Roles-Opt-1-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The Pastoral leader is standing next to a sofa and a water-cooler $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-6.2.1-Staff-Roles-Opt-1-2.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The careers adviser is sitting at a round table speaking with a student who is looking at their laptop $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-6.2.1-Staff-Roles-Opt-1-3.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The librarian is standing in front of some bookshelves $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-6.2.1-Staff-Roles-Opt-1-4.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The Science/D&T/Art/ICT technician is preparing equipment in a laboratory. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-6.2.1-Staff-Roles-Opt-1-5.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$I\n\n<h2>\n  <b>Remember </b>\n</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The time you spend building effective relationships with parents, carers,\n  families and specialist colleagues will pay you back.

In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum._\n\nTypes of need are categorised as:\n\n- **Specific learning difficulties** which refer to a specific aspect of learning, e.g. a difficulty with numbers (dyscalculia) or literacy (dyslexia).\n- **General learning difficulties** refer to a child who finds it difficult to learn, understand and do things compared to other children of the same age. General learning difficulties can be moderate, severe or profound.\n\nMost pupils with severe or profound learning difficulties will receive support through an Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP). These outline the individual needs of the pupil and the provision in place to support them. It is important that you familiarise yourself with the EHCP, and any equivalent plans your school has in place, for the pupils you teach.\n\nPupils identified as having moderate or specific learning difficulties may not have an EHCP and it will be up to you to implement support for them. Many students in your class and school may be identified as SEN support and will likely require a very personalised approach to best meet their needs. Close collaboration and positive relationships with colleagues - especially the SENCO and TAs - families and pupils support us to identify and address potential barriers.\n\nThe SEND Code of Practice (2015) highlights the vital role that parents play in supporting children and young people with SEND. Parents can help you understand the needs of individual learners and ensure you provide the appropriate support for them.\n\nParents are the best placed individuals to provide details on:\n\n- The health and early development of their child\n- The support they have received outside the school system\n- Whether any difficulties have been noted at home or elsewhere\n\nConsider how you communicate with parents and carers of SEND pupils and capture their views. Have you thought specifically about whether the information you share with families is accessible and whether they feel comfortable and confident to respond and communicate with you?\n\nSome parents of SEND pupils may have faced negative experiences in communications with their child’s school previously. Some may themselves have additional needs. This might result in them finding it difficult to engage with teachers and school leaders and will require a personalised approach. For example, a parent may find meeting in a classroom or office intimidating. Instead, you could arrange to conduct a meeting in a soft-seating area in the school or build up to face to face meetings in the school after you have built a strong relationship through phone calls and email.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How many parents/carers of the pupils with SEN have you had conversations\n      with?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What have these conversations told you?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What further conversations would be useful to have?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When will you have these?</span>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$CTA\n\nThe four broad areas of need and support are:\n\n- Communication and interaction\n- Cognition and learning\n- Social, emotional and mental health difficulties\n- Sensory and/or physical needs\n\nExamples of the different types of need and potential classroom strategies are listed below.

These could be pictures/symbols/ Makaton signs or a combination of them all. - Give clear directions/instructions using key words. Avoid lengthy descriptions which make it challenging for pupils with SLCN to access key messages. - Consider your classroom environment and seating arrangements. Many pupils with SLCN will benefit from having a clear line of sight and close proximity to the teacher. - Make sure you give pupils the appropriate time to process a question or instruction (this will be different for all pupils). Teachers often fail to provide enough processing time. - Graphic organisers can support pupils to become more independent by presenting information through a combination of images and key words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| **Cognition and learning**- Pupils who have difficulties with attention, memory, problem solving, reasoning, transfer of learning, language or literacy                                                | - Explicit teaching of reading. Teach pupils the different aspects of reading and explicitly teach the link between reading, spelling and writing. - Use of visual support / key words and cues to help students to be more independent in their learning, e.g. a wall display to show you to layout writing. - Focused, clear objectives. - Model your thought process to show your cognitive process. - Learning through talk and discussion with peers and adults. Teachers explaining and commentating on activities can be an effective strategy. - Scaffolding – break down the work for the pupil into small achievable steps. (See Block 3 for more information on this.) - Graphic organisers. Use graphical organisers such as cognitive maps or story frames to teach story structure and help reading comprehension. - Creating “sticky knowledge” books can support students in making links in their learning and develop their ability to transfer and generalise learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| **Behavioural, emotional and social development**- Pupils who have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD) - Pupils with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)                 | - Develop routines and use positively reinforcing language around behaviour. See Block 1 for more information on this. - Work with pupils and families to identify key motivators and design high-interest activities that you know will be engaging. - Create a personalised positive behaviour support and engagement plan to share with all teachers and support staff. - Collect data for a pupil and identify the times they are highly engaged and also when they find it difficult to regulate. What do you notice? Are there patterns around times of day/certain activities that a pupil finds difficult? Can you adapt the environment to better meet their needs? - Peer-monitoring. Pupils are given a “buddy” to support them with behaviour, reminding them when they deviate from the targeted behaviour. - Self-monitoring. This asks the pupil to recognise a targeted behaviour and then take positive steps to alter the behaviour, e.g. a pupil has a vibrating pager which goes off periodically and reminds them to self-check. - Positive reinforcement. Appropriate behaviour is immediately recognised and rewarded (see Block 1 for more detail). - Headphones. In an individual task a pupil is given headphones which play white noise so that they can effectively block out distractions. - Pupil logs. Provide pupils with a log to identify and write down preparation/behaviour difficulties. Reflect and review together. - Prompts. Provide pupil with prompts they can refer to or tick off, e.g. Did I get my pen out? Did I remember by reading book? Did I write my homework down? |\n| **Sensory and/or physical**- Pupils with visual impairments (VI) - Pupils with hearing impairments (HI) - Pupils with multi-sensory impairments (MSI) - Pupils who are physical disabled (PD)          | - Talk with your pupils and their families to discover their sensory preferences and how they respond to different stimuli. - Create multi-sensory areas in your classroom and a portable sensory suitcase that can follow a student around school. - Adapt the environment to increase access to and participation in learning. You might need to adapt seating plans, desk layout and organisation so that specific needs are met. - Explore and research different technology that can support sensory learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\nIt is imperative that you know, understand and are able to action the safeguarding policy your school holds.

I am a class teacher for three days a week and have\n  two days a week non-contact time to concentrate on my SENCO leadership and\n  management role. There are 62 children on the SEN Register, and many more who\n  we are monitoring closely. We follow government and local authority guidance,\n  using documents like the SEND Code of Practice to plan our approaches to\n  supporting pupils. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  My role is to lead on developing our policies and make sure that teachers are\n  supported effectively to follow them. People think that my role is largely to\n  do with paperwork: submitting referrals to outside agencies such as Speech and\n  Language Therapists, Education Psychology, Autism Outreach, and completing\n  applications for Education Health Care Plans, and it is true: this takes up a\n  great deal of time. However, I am also here to monitor the quality of\n  classroom provision for all children with SEND and advise teachers on how to\n  make classrooms, and teaching and learning, more inclusive.

For example, if you had a pupil who was dyslexic, you might use cloze exercises in which you give the pupil a worksheet with key information you will be covering in the lesson with words blanked out. The pupil would then be able to use that to take notes. - Make any necessary adjustments to seating plans. For example, a pupil with a slight visual impairment would need to be moved to sit near the front of the room to be able to see the board clearly. - When talking to parents/carers, show awareness and understanding. Ask for any insights or strategies that have been previously successful. - Set up an ongoing dialogue with parents/carers so that you can discuss any issues that arise. - Work with the TA to adapt your approach for each pupil. |\n| A pupil you teach who has special educational needs is clearly struggling                        | - Contact home and ask for support. - Contact the SENCO for support and advice. - Reach out to other colleagues who might be able to help you, such as the pastoral lead who may be able to offer insights into other things that might be going on. - Reflect on any changes that might be impacting on the student. Gather information and data around the challenges the student is facing and how/when these are presenting.

Draw on their expertise by asking the TA to give you feedback about specific aspects of your teaching, such as:- Which pupils did I spend most time with this lesson? Were there any pupils I should have spent more time with? - Did I ask a range of different question types? - Was I consistent in my approaches across different pupils and/or different lessons? - Can you suggest any colleagues who I could observe in relation to one or more areas of development?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ### **Equal time** allocationsTAs should supplement, not replace, support from teachers. Try this activity to review how much time you spend with pupils compared to the time they spend with the TA:- Look at a series of lessons (a week or half term). - Plan your own role within each lesson and which groups of pupils both you and the TA(s) or other adults will work with. - Estimate what proportion of your time is spent with each group and what proportion of the TA(s) or other adults’ time. - If each pupil is not gaining an equal share of your time, adjust your planning to change this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ### **Sharing** planningThe TA will support pupils more effectively when you prepare for lessons with them. Try this series of planning steps to help with this:- Ensure the TA or the other adults you work with in lessons have copies of your lesson plans. - Arrange a time to discuss your plans. Make this a regular meeting and keep the time short: having a consistent approach will keep the meetings focused. - In advance of each meeting, make a list of key points and questions to discuss with them, including how this lesson fits into the sequence of learning, the intended outcomes of the lesson, the ways in which you will work together and your expectations of their role. - Together, agree the specific intentions for the pupils they will be working with, and how you will evaluate the outcomes of the lesson for these pupils. - Respond to any questions they have, especially in relation to the subject knowledge of the lesson, and check that you are both clear on your roles and how you will work together in the lesson. - Seek support from your mentor if there are logistical factors that make shared planning difficult. |\n| ### **Pupils’** investment** in learning**The TA and other adults often build long-term relationships with pupils and therefore understand their prior experiences of success and failure. Identify a pupil or group of pupils who the TA knows well and ask them:- What prior successes has the pupil experienced? - What prior failures? - What have you learned about the pupil’s learning based on this? - What conversations could we have with pupils to help them articulate their long-term goals? - How could we use this information in our lessons to help the pupil to experience greater success in their learning?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ### Supplementing** teacher support**The TA and other adults should be given constructive, concrete roles in pupils’ learning. Their role should not be just “manage Josie’s behaviour” or “sit with Sun-Yee”. Instead, plan their role to be one or more of:- Working with pupils as a “talk partner” to discuss thinking and answers. - Providing appropriate scaffolding using the “least first” principle (see Mentor Handout 6.5b). - Supporting pupils to help them make improvements to work based on your feedback. - Challenging the learning of pupils who are achieving well by asking them to explain their answers to questions. - Recording evidence of pupils’ responses to aid assessment. - Following up learning from last session with specific targeted questions, which you write together. - Working as part of a “double act” with you to address misconceptions or worked examples, such as the TA asking you further questions to help you model how to find the answer to a problem, working from a script you have devised together before the lesson.                                                                                        |\n| ### **Using** information** from assessment**The TA and other adults will gain vital information about pupils’ learning. Find out about this by:- Arranging a time soon after each lesson/day for brief, informal feedback about pupil learning. Together use this time to identify achievement in relation to intended learning and appropriate next steps. - Arranging a regular time once every half term for a longer feedback and review session. Use this to jointly agree targets for pupils for the next period. - Jointly, use your assessments to identify gaps and misconceptions in learning and plan activities that will support these pupils to overcome their misconceptions and fill gaps in their learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n", nil, "924d49bb-9475-4f7c-8b55-10a79607c1ac"],

When you started on this programme, you began by looking at how\n  to establish a positive learning environment. You learned about how to make\n  your classroom a secure, safe and predictable place for your pupils through\n  setting up and developing classroom routines, communication of your high\n  expectations and building positive relationships. You’ve had a whole year to\n  practise these and you will have had many successes. No doubt, there are still\n  times when managing behaviour and keeping your expectations really high is\n  challenging. That is why we are revisiting it now at the beginning of Year 2,\n  just as you will be doing the same with your pupils.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In this Block, we build on your knowledge by looking at what motivates pupils.\n  Understanding ‘what makes them tick’ will help you to develop an even more\n  purposeful learning environment. You will explore the different ways you can\n  motivate pupils, from using rewards to helping your pupils develop more\n  personal motivation. You have already explored the importance of upholding\n  high expectations and you will see this is also a key factor in motivation;\n  you will explore the link between maintaining high expectations and your\n  pupils feeling motivated to work hard and apply effort. You will also consider\n  how enabling your pupils to achieve meaningful success can motivate them to\n  put in the effort needed for further success.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  We will look further at the importance and value of the language you use with\n  pupils, highlighting the ways we can use language to establish an effective\n  learning environment and support pupils, empowering them to take ownership of\n  their own learning. In Block 1 you explored how you could demonstrate your\n  high expectations to your pupils and the impact this would have on pupil\n  outcomes. In this Block you will consider how you can use praise meaningfully\n  to support and motivate your pupils.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "29da9b69-1835-4400-a9ee-83ca81225f62"],

With this in mind, it is important to plan appropriate challenge for your pupils and support them to achieve. As we established earlier, succeeding in difficult tasks is motivating for your pupils and is likely to drive further success. We want to harness this and use it to drive learning forwards. You can support pupils to achieve through the learning activities you set, how you structure these and how you put them into practice.\n\nThe following strategies will support your pupils to achieve success in the challenging tasks you set. When planning for this, you should set an activity which will support your pupils to achieve an existing learning goal. This should stretch them: they should be required to apply effort and to think hard. It will be necessary to explain this explicitly to your pupils to ensure that they persevere.\n\nAs you start planning, ask yourself:\n\n1. What are the main learning goals for this group over the next period?\n2. What challenging knowledge, concept or skill will enable them to move closer to this goal?\n3. Which of the following strategies would best support them to master this concept?\n\n## Scaffolding to support pupils to achieve success\n\n### By trying this activity, you will…\n\n#### Learn how to: Communicate a belief in the academic potential of all pupils, by:\n\n1b Setting tasks that stretch and challenge pupils, but which are achievable, within a challenging curriculum.\n\n#### Motivate pupils, by:\n\n7m Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals.\n\n### If this is happening in your classroom, you will see…\n\n- Pupils have resources to support them in tasks.\n- Pupils understand the instructions they are given.\n- Pupils achieving success in tasks which may otherwise have been too challenging.\n\n### Practise…\n\n#### Instructional strategies\n\nNovices benefit from explicit instruction. You could:\n\n- Use direct instruction to teach basic knowledge and concepts rather than ‘discovery learning’ or ‘problem solving approaches’.\n- Use modelling and worked examples, including ‘thinking out loud’ (explaining your reasoning/thinking behind what you are doing).\n- Break up lengthier tasks into smaller steps, making them more achievable.\n\nFor example:\n\n- ‘Today we are going to be learning about the Cold War. I am going to start by giving you some key facts.’\n- ‘So I can now see that before I can work out the value of X, I am going to have to go back to the beginning of my equation.’\n\n#### Using resources\n\nWe need to consider the resources we use within lessons and how these can contribute positively towards supporting pupils.\n\n- Use concrete resources (e.g. artefacts, apparatus) that aid understanding of abstract concepts.\n- Adapt task resources to scaffold thinking (e.g. using a worksheet to provide structure to a talk, providing word banks, using visual prompts, providing sentence stems, knowledge organisers etc).\n- Use resources (including technology) to enable pupils to access written tasks (e.g. mini-whiteboards, recording devices etc).\n\nFor example:\n\n- ‘In front of you, you can see the spinning top. We are going to use this to explore angular momentum and gyroscopic motion.’\n- ‘Today you are going to write your description of the haunted house. You have a word bank and sentence starters to help you.’\n- ‘I am going to write three key words on your mini-whiteboard, George. I want you to cross off each one as you use it in your paragraph.’\n\n#### Managing cognitive load\n\nWhen our pupils try to make sense of new information, we can reduce the chances of overloading their working memory.\n\n- Provide resources to scaffold and structure learning (see above).\n- Ensure you give specific and manageable task-related instructions (refer to Block 1).\n- Being mindful of how we present information so that it is as clear as possible.\n- Break down complex information or activities into smaller chunks.\n- Use visual cues alongside auditory to support understanding.\n\nFor example\n\n- ‘We are going to begin by planning our stories using the building blocks shown on your worksheet.’\n- ‘Firstly, I need you to open your books to page 20. We are going to read the next chapter thinking about how the author presents the character Mr Birling.’\n- ‘Similes use the words like or as. Similes are about comparison and focus on similarities. We can describe something unfamiliar by comparing it to something familiar.’\n- ‘We are all going to begin by writing our opening sentence using an adjective and an adverb.’\n\nIn your notepad, reflect on your practice…\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Which idea(s) for practice did you try?</li>\n  <li>What did you do?</li>\n  <li>What happened?</li>\n  <li>What will you do next?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "50c22346-3523-4322-aaeb-0abe06799893"],

Maybe your mentor has been reminding you for the last week or so, and you felt you couldn’t put it off any longer. It’s hard to get started with a new piece of learning and you needed a push from someone to get going. Or maybe you’re feeling pretty excited about it. You’ve been seeing the improvement in your practice over the last few months and really want to be the best teacher possible. Perhaps it’s a bit of both.\n\nEither of these feelings are recognised and valid reasons for doing this work – motivation is often considered to be either:\n\n### Intrinsic motivation\n\nFrom internal sources, such as the pure enjoyment of task engagement.\n\n### Extrinsic motivation\n\nFrom external sources such as receiving financial compensation.\n\n(Lazowski & Hullman, 2016)\n\n## In the classroom this could look like:\n\n### Intrinsic motivation\n\n- Pupils reading for enjoyment\n- Pupils wanting to try new things because they want to learn\n- Revising work to improve it because they want to do better\n- Seeing feedback as a learning opportunity\n\n### Extrinsic motivation\n\n- Reading because parents/carers/teachers have said you should\n- Working hard to get a reward\n- Focusing on the grade/score rather than the feedback on work\n- Completing an activity/task to get a reward\n\nAs part of a highly effective learning environment, we must ensure that our pupils are motivated to learn: the evidence shows that motivated pupils learn more and have better outcomes (Lazowski & Hullman, 2016).\n\nAs teachers, we need to understand our pupils and plan activities which motivate them. We can’t assume that pupils are always motivated simply by a love of learning for its own sake (although this may be the case for some pupils). Like all of us, pupils are motivated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors and we must consider both of these when planning lessons and establishing a supportive learning environment.\n\nLots of the time, pupils you teach will be motivated by extrinsic rewards and these can be a useful tool when implemented carefully. If used in the wrong way, however, this type of motivation can become transactional with pupils only doing work or putting in effort when receiving a reward upon completion. Over time, this can give the message that it is ability (the ends) rather than effort (the means) that is important. When used prudently however, rewards can help create a positive learning environment and even encourage intrinsic motivation.\n\nWillingham (2009) considers the use of rewards in the classroom, citing conflicting research that suggests rewards have the potential for either a positive or a negative effect in the classroom. A study that used incentives, including money, to motivate GCSE pupils found that although there was some improvement in effort in class, there was no evidence of any impact on behaviour, attendance or homework effort, nor was there any impact on attainment in Maths, English or Science (Sibieta, et al., 2014).\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer as to whether to use rewards, but rather it is how we use rewards in our classrooms that matters. Used well, rewards (an extrinsic motivation) can be used to develop some of the behaviours which may lead to intrinsic motivation such as perseverance, effort and seeking challenge:\n\n| Teachers should:                                                              | The reason why                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Exemplification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Use rewards for a specific reason, such as encouraging appropriate behaviours | Rewards can be used effectively to encourage a desired behaviour, which might be seen as dull, but mastering the foundational concepts and knowledge will aid long-term success.                                | For example, teachers might reward consistently good behaviour, ‘You have really persevered with this task, I am going to give you a merit, well done.’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Use rewards in the moment and avoid giving them too regularly                 | If used for too long, it is more likely that use of a reward will actually have negative implications: rewards with novelty are more appealing. Pupils should not complete tasks expecting a reward at the end. | For example, if a teacher gives out a small reward each time their pupils put their hands up to answer a question, they will soon run out of rewards, and pupils will lose interest in them (or worse, see this as an enjoyable game). Instead, offer rewards infrequently and try to make them unexpected. This will help pupils view their work as something to complete for their own benefit rather than for a reward. ‘I am so impressed with the effort you have shown in this task, I am going to phone home and tell your parents how hard you have worked today.’ |\n| Beware of rewarding pupils for tasks they (should) enjoy                      | For pupils who already enjoyed doing the task when the reward was offered, it may result in them enjoying the task less than they did at the start: the reward has the effect of de-motivating.                 | For example, if pupils are rewarded for the number of books they read, this may turn reading into a mechanical activity in order to achieve the reward rather than an enjoyable activity in its own right. Instead you might praise the pupil for trying a more challenging book. ‘I am going to give you a merit for your reading today, I know you chose a really challenging book.’                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\nLook at the table and consider the strategies you use in your lessons or in your\nschool to motivate pupils. <strong>\n  What are three lessons for your practice which you could take from this table?\n</strong>\n1. 2. 3. $CTA\n\n## Helping pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically\n\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge that all pupils are individuals and will be motivated in different ways and for different reasons, as teachers there are steps we can take to encourage and support pupils to develop an intrinsic love of learning and an understanding that effort and the process of learning are crucial for success. This will hold them in good stead in their life beyond school.\n\nAnd developing a sense of personal, intrinsic motivation is a vital goal of a pupil’s education. We want pupils to see themselves as the type of people who work hard and can succeed, for the right reasons: motivation is ideally part of your personal identity and aligned to your values.\n\nOne of the main ways you can influence pupil motivation is through rewards. Rewards play to pupils’ extrinsic motivation, but they can also be used to ‘nudge’ them towards behaviours which – over time – are representative of more intrinsic motivation.\n\n### Types of reward\n\n- Verbal praise\n- Thumbs-up\n- Merits\n- Postcards home\n- Phone call home\n- Stickers\n- Public praise in assembly\n- Certificates\n\n### How to encourage intrinsic motivation\n\n- Rewarding effort\n- Rewarding learning strategies\n- Rewarding learning processes\n- Rewarding persistence\n- Rewarding resilience\n- Rewarding good behaviour\n- Rewarding progress rather than attainment\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\nConsider the way that you use rewards to motivate in your lessons by answering the\nquestions below:\n<ol>\n  <li>Take a look at the table above, how do you reward your pupils?</li>\n  <li>\n    From your reflections, what do you notice about the way you reward pupils?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Do you think you mainly try to motivate pupils for extrinsic reasons or\n    intrinsic reasons?\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$CTA\n\nOften, the policy for pupil rewards will be set at school rather than classroom level.

All tutors work with their tutor groups to set individual goals; these may be around self-regulation. Students are rewarded for achieving personal bests and effort towards achieving those goals. Rather than asking pupils to compare themselves to others, we teach self-assessment techniques and ask pupils to evaluate their own progress towards their goals.\n\nWe also try to convey a clear message about what the school truly values in our pupils. We use awards assemblies to show pupils that we value academic prowess, but we also reward and acknowledge effort and pupil improvement. Every half-term we have award certificates and gift vouchers for the ‘most improved’ pupil in each subject. We bring in motivational speakers to inspire our pupils and show them that if they put in effort, they will get the results.\n\nWe ask teachers to use positive language with all of their classes and to pitch their lessons to be challenging but inclusive. Teachers should plan for their most-able pupil and then provide scaffolding to support all of their pupils to achieve success. There are too many pupils being under-challenged when conversely, challenge that leads to success is motivating for pupils.\n\nWhenever possible, we advocate offering pupils choices in their own learning. If pupils are able to have some autonomy over their learning, they are more likely to value it and put in more effort.\n\nI like to openly discuss motivation with my pupils and talk about my own personal motivations. I actively show pupils that success is important but doesn’t always look the same. I try to show pupils that we are all on a personal learning journey and learning in itself can be rewarding.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>What does the school leader do to support motivation in their school?</li>\n  <li>Are there any strategies you think might work particularly well?

Interestingly, it is more likely that **pupil success _leads to_ increased motivation**, rather than pupils being motivated to succeed in the first place.\n\nThe evidence shows that if your pupils can see the _value_ of the work they have been asked to do and _believe_ they can _succeed_ in it, the likelihood of them being intrinsically motivated will be much greater (EEF, 2013). Motivation to achieve has been shown to consist of:\n\n- Students’ expectations of success (e.g. ‘I think I can do this – we’ve done something similar before.’)\n- Their perception of the overall value of the activity or task (e.g. ‘I can see how this topic is an important part of the subject, and I want to know more.’)\n- How much they value the task at hand (e.g. ‘I can see that understanding this concept is key to succeeding in this topic.’)\n\nPupils are individuals and will perceive success in different ways. Success could take a number of forms such as grasping a tricky concept, reading aloud to the class or achieving a good mark in an assessment. What a pupil perceives as success is dependent on their prior experiences and it is important to be mindful of this. If a pupil achieves success in your lessons, and is able to experience and enjoy the feeling of succeeding, they are likely to be motivated to work hard and strive for further success. By offering opportunities for all pupils to achieve success we can motivate pupils to want to work hard and learn.\n\nOf course, this is a two-way street. Prior experience of _failure_ is also influential on motivation. In your classroom, it is important to avoid things which will lead to pupils to perceive of themselves as ‘failing’.\n\n| Things that can reduce pupils’ investment in learning | Strategies to increase pupils’ investment in learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Pupils are scared of failing                          | Encourage a sense of self-belief in pupils- Avoid creating a negative response to mistakes and errors - Encourage pupils to see mistakes as opportunities to learn and improve                                                                                                                  |\n| Pupils unable to see how the task relates to them     | Demonstrate and highlight the value in a task- Show how the content links to everyday life - If possible link the work with the pupils’ understanding of the world                                                                                                                              |\n| Work is too easy                                      | Plan lessons that are suitably challenging- Continuously assess what pupils know and are able to do and adjust lessons accordingly - Remove scaffolds when necessary                                                                                                                            |\n| Work is too challenging                               | Plan lessons that are suitably challenging- Be aware of the pupils who need extra support and plan accordingly - Scaffold work to support pupils.

Ideally we want to set up a self-reinforcing cycle: if we hold consistently high expectations for our pupils and ensure that we are teaching them well then pupils can begin to experience success, which in turn can lead to greater motivation to succeed. This often means pushing pupils slightly beyond what they are comfortable with – having high expectations means that all pupils must be expected to participate in challenging tasks – and sometimes success may not be instant. We need to avoid this feeling like ‘failure’. To help maintain their motivation, you should teach pupils that:\n\n- They are allowed to get things wrong\n- Learning is difficult\n- A struggle can be part of the process\n- They shouldn’t give up when things are difficult at first\n- Errors and mistakes are part of learning\n- They can ask you for help\n- They are allowed to ask questions of their learning\n\nThis needs skilful management to ensure pupils can succeed; struggling too much might indicate that the tasks are pitched too high or need more scaffolding. When pupils understand that to make errors is part of the process of learning, they will be more willing to put effort in to challenging tasks and less likely to give up when they face difficulties. Learning requires thinking. As Coe states, ‘learning happens when people have to think hard’ (Coe et al., 2013). Thinking hard is – unsurprisingly – hard.\n\nPupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure. When pupils understand that they can improve through hard work and practice, rather than having set abilities that they cannot increase, it is likely that they will work harder (‘I will improve if I put in more effort’). Teachers should support pupils to develop this belief in their own ability to succeed by helping them to identify what has helped them to learn and be successful previously. We explored how to use feedback to do this effectively in Block 5 and will return to this in Block 11.\n\nA key technique for achieving this positive reinforcement of pupils’ beliefs in themselves is praise. While praise can be used to support and motivate pupils, but it is important to be mindful of the impact our praise can have.\n\n- Praise should be sincere and honest\n- Praise should emphasise process not ability\n- Praise should be as immediate as possible\n\n(Willingham, 2009)\n\n|                                                                                                |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **When giving praise, try to avoid...**                                                        |\n| Praising intelligence rather than effort: ‘Well done, you are really clever at mathematics.’   |\n| Praising the outcome: ‘You got 83%, that is great.’                                            |\n| Attributing success to ability: ‘I knew you would do well at that task, you always do.’        |\n| Revealing grudges: ‘I can see you’re trying as hard in this lesson as you didn't last lesson.’ |\n| Giving the impression that success comes easily: ‘Great answer, this is easy for you.’         |\n\nWhen praise is used effectively it can tell students that they are on the right track and motivate them to continue working. Using praise judiciously and communicating genuine warmth and enthusiasm can have a direct impact on motivation and the learning environment.\n\n| Strategies to use                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Praise the effort.‘Well done, that was a difficult task and you worked really hard to get that result.’                                                                                                                    | We want pupils to see that the effort they put in can have an impact on the results they get.

As we have seen, knowledge and\n  expertise accumulate, with new information linking to and reinforcing what we\n  knew already. Poor recall may well indicate that this is not happening. While\n  as an adult you may not remember everything that you were taught in school,\n  much of it will be helping to support the knowledge you currently have and\n  use. And not unimportantly for schools, pupils’ knowledge is tested at various\n  points in their education to see what they have learned. If everything goes in\n  one ear and out the other, neither the pupil nor the school will get the\n  formal recognition of their successes, and all that this brings.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In Block 2, you explored how pupils learn; how the working memory can become\n  overloaded and how we as teachers can use our understanding of how children\n  learn to design instruction and tasks which support pupils when learning new\n  material. Hopefully, you have been using many of the techniques over the past\n  year, such as introducing new material in small steps and providing worked\n  examples, and have seen the benefit of these in helping pupils to learn\n  better. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This Block builds directly on Block 2. We are now considering how we can make\n  new learning ‘stick’ over time so that pupils remember what they have been\n  taught. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This is relevant at all phases and in all subjects.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In Early Years, you need pupils to be able to remember certain things, such as\n  which hook to put their coats on to avoid chaos at pick-up time! They will\n  also be developing some of the fundamental knowledge and know-how that they\n  need for success at school and throughout their lives.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In Primary and Secondary, as you plan to teach more complex ideas or concepts\n  you will be building on previously taught material. Again, all new learning is\n  based on prior knowledge. Pupils connect new ideas into existing schemata in\n  their long-term memory. The better pupils remember something, the more easily\n  they will be able to grasp new ideas. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The point about not remembering everything we encounter at school is of course\n  important: there is always going to be an element of decay in our memories.\n  This comes down to two main factors; storage strength{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  how well did you embed the learning in your long-term memory? And retrieval\n  strength{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  how often you have accessed the memory over time? At some point, knowledge\n  will fade if it is not useful to you or used by you.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Although there is a level of responsibility which lies with your pupils{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  Did they spend any time revising in advance of the test? Did they actively\n  think about which hook to put their coat onto?{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  as the teacher you also have responsibility to plan how you will support\n  pupils to retain information over time. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Education researchers have identified some effective ways teachers can help\n  pupils to do this. For example:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Making sure pupils encounter new material more than once and at spaced\n      intervals\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Incorporating tasks which require pupils to actively retrieve information\n      from their memory\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Providing opportunity to practise new material, ideally with feedback.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The added benefit of planning activities like these into your lessons{\" \"}\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and making the reason clear to pupils </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  is that it demonstrates which study approaches work best. As pupils get older,\n  and do more independent study, they will be using techniques which are shown\n  to be effective as opposed to less effective techniques such as highlighting\n  text or passively re-reading pages of notes. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Remember, it is not just about the exam at the end of the year. You are\n  setting pupils up for a lifetime of learning. In Early Years and Primary you\n  are teaching pupils the foundational skills which they need to access all\n  subjects and disciplines such as reading and writing. At Secondary level,\n  perhaps pupils will choose to continue studying your subject at Key Stage\n  Four, college or university and the knowledge you help them to retain now will\n  form the basis of even more rewarding learning to come.{\" \"}\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "d8a00af1-b636-48f5-af76-072646f36ac9"],

It is prudent and right to scaffold learning for pupils, particularly when they are dealing with new or complex material for the first time, but there comes a point where pupils will need to remember what you have taught them and apply their learning independently, for example in tests or in lessons the following year with a different teacher.\n\nWhen learning has taken place, there is a lasting change. Imagine a toddler learning to walk. They don’t (or rarely) revert back to shuffling on their bum. A lasting change in their capabilities for how to move has taken place and they are able to then build on this new skill to learn more complex movements, such as running or skipping.\n\nNow imagine your pupils. What can they do now that they couldn’t do before?\n\nThis might be something you have directly taught them, such as how to factorise an equation or write a compelling paragraph. It might be a social skill they have learned through interacting with others, such as waiting their turn or being polite when they encounter other people around the school.\n\nWhatever the learning that has taken place, the common thing you will notice is that when they were first learning the skill or knowledge, they required support and prompts (“Wait until Sarah has taken her turn first.”), but once they have learned it they are able to do it independently (“Please go ahead, you were here first.”) and, importantly, it is learning that lasts. It represents a lasting change in their capabilities or understanding which extends beyond the initial teaching moment.\n\nThere are many things which you will want your pupils to learn and be able to remember. It might be a set of facts or knowledge which you know will be important for further study in a particular subject or topic, such as the parts of an atom. It might be a foundational skill, like reading, which you know underpins learning across all subject areas.\n\nIn Block 2 you learned about how pupils learn related to memory and cognition. In simple terms, we each have a working memory and a long-term memory. When we remember something, we are pulling the information from our long-term memory.\n\nWhile our working memory is limited by both capacity and duration (Cowan, 2008), our long-term memory is a vast storehouse with no known capacity. This is good news for teachers – pupils in theory _can_ learn all of the material you want them to remember. The biggest limitation is the working memory which can become overloaded and therefore stop processing new information and preventing it being transferred successfully to the long-term memory. Even if it does reach the long-term memory, unless it is actively used again it is likely to be forgotten.\n\nTherefore, making use of evidence-informed approaches to support pupils to transfer new knowledge to their long-term memory _and to strengthen it when it gets there_ is a key aspect of teaching.\n\nUntil relatively recently, this field of expertise – what some now call the science of learning – was unknown to many educators. As Dunlosky et al. (2013) point out, psychologists have been developing and evaluating the efficacy of particular approaches to memory and learning for over 100 years. There is a vast array of evidence about which techniques are the most effective in helping people to learn which have been replicated to the point we can be very confident they are true. And yet many teachers (and therefore pupils) do not use them. Indeed, many of the techniques which are popular are ineffective, yet we continue to use them. Examples of popular but comparatively ineffective techniques include reading, highlighting and underlining text for revision, learning styles and the idea that motivation alone leads to learning (as we saw in Block 1, the relationship is, if anything, the other way round and success is likely to lead to higher levels of motivation).\n\n## Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned\n\nWhen something has been learned, it has been transferred into the long-term memory and is stored in schemata and can therefore be recalled when needed. For example, when you first learned that new sentences start with a capital letter you added this new fact to your schema on ‘writing’, ‘reading’ and ‘grammar’. After you learned this new fact, your teacher probably got you to practise writing sentences. They almost certainly prompted you to retrieve this rule from your long-term memory when you made errors, through feedback or correction, and you understood why you were being asked to practise further. Since then you have regularly practised writing many sentences using capital letters. it is now second nature and seeing a sentence without a capital letter at the start jars! Through regular, purposeful practice you consolidated a piece of new learning.\n\nNot all new material is something which you can (or should) practise as often as capital letters but if you want your pupils to really remember something which they have learned, they will need to practise it over time. In contrast to the passive study techniques mentioned above, doing something active when reviewing previously taught material – for example practice testing – has been shown to help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned:\n\n- Recall activities, e.g.\n\n  - Using flashcards\n  - Quizzes\n  - Answering questions on previously learned materials\n\n- Completing practice questions, e.g.\n\n  - As homework\n  - In class\n\n- Practice tests, e.g.\n\n  - Completing past papers\n  - Multiple-choice tests\n\nAs Adescope et al. (2017) highlight, ‘the testing effect is a well-known concept referring to gains in learning and retention that can occur when students take a practice test on studied material before taking a final test on the same material. Research demonstrates that students who take practice tests often outperform students in non-testing learning conditions such as restudying, practice, filler activities, or no presentation of the material.’\n\nThe quote above refers to tests before tests. It’s likely that if your pupils are preparing for an exam, you will have given them ‘mock’ practice tests for them to complete either as homework or in class so that they practise. This is nothing new. But it is not just in preparation for exams that pupils should practise. Anything which you want pupils to remember needs to be practised.\n\nYou should remember that ‘practice is an important aspect of learning, but not all practice is equal’ (Deans for Impact, 2015). There are a few considerations which you need to make when planning practice activities for pupils:\n\n- Dosage – how much practice should pupils do of the material?\n- Timing – when should they practise the material?\n- Feedback – how do pupils know they are practicing the right material?\n\nIn terms of dosage, the American professor of psychology John Dunlosky (2013) advises that the simplest answer is: the more the better. Multiple opportunities for pupils to practise material significantly improves recall, as demonstrated through a final test, compared to pupils who only practise once. One way schools address this is through their curriculum planning, giving pupils chances to encounter the same topics or themes iteratively at points throughout a course (a spiral curriculum), and perhaps across year groups. In your own planning, or in that of your department or Key Stage group, you may well see this approach being taken.\n\nHave a look at the draft scheme of work below.\n\n- How has the teacher mapped opportunities for pupils to be able to revisit previously learned material content over time?\n\nConsider your scheme(s) of learning for this year:\n\n- Are there opportunities for pupils to practise previously learned material again?\n\n### Example\n\n| Unit | Year 1                | Year 2                           | Year 3                                      | Year 4          | Year 5          |\n| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| 1    | Numbers to 10         | Numbers to 1000                  | Numbers to 10,000                           | Whole numbers 1 | Whole numbers 2 |\n| 2    | Number bonds          | Addition and subtraction to 1000 | Subtraction of numbers starting with 10,000 | Whole numbers 2 | Whole numbers 3 |\n| 3    | Addition within 10    | Using models Addition problems   | Solving word problems Addition              | Fractions 1     | Fractions 2     |\n| 4    | Subtraction within 10 | Using models Subtraction         | Solving word problems Subtraction           | Decimals 1      | Decimals 2      |\n| 5    | Numbers to 20         | Multiplying by 2 and 3           | Multiplying by 7, 8 and 9                   | Measurement     | ...             |\n| 6    | Length                | Multiplying by 4, 5 and 6        | Multiplication problems                     | ...             | ...             |\n\nWhen planning for pupils to practise material multiple times, you do need to take into account the time between each practice. Several studies have found that practice in quick succession has minimal benefits, compared to sizable benefits which occur when practice is spaced over time (Dunlosky, 2013). In this country, guidance from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) states that, ‘[l]earning everything to do with a topic during a single time period is not as effective as distributed learning’ (EEF, 2018).\n\nAs with dosage, where more is better, with spacing, longer is generally better. There are multiple studies which have shown the benefits of delaying reviews of material so pupils have almost forgotten it before they encounter it again (Pachler et al., 2007). While this might seem counterintuitive, spaced learning actually helps pupils with the process of cementing new material into their long-term memory. When it is massed together (think cramming before an exam), the knowledge may be retained for a short while, but is likely to be lost later. As knowledge becomes more secure, you can increase the challenge by extending the time between practice opportunities.\n\nPachler et al. (2007) recommend that you should ‘space learning over time. Arrange to review key elements of course content after a delay of several weeks to several months after initial presentation.’ To identify these key elements, think back to Block 4 and ask yourself:\n\n- What key facts would it be helpful for my pupils to commit to their long-term memory so they can easily recall them and use them when learning more complex ideas?\n\nIt is recommended that pupils encounter new material on at least two separate occasions. In some cases, this will happen naturally as pupils progress through content (e.g. pupils will use full stops in almost every writing assignment after they are taught it). In other cases, you will need to explicitly plan when new material will be reviewed and practised.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Definition</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Spaced practice is when opportunities to review and practise the material are\n  distributed over time. Instead of just seeing it once, pupils will be exposed\n  to the content at spaced gaps.\n</span>\n$I\n\n## Video\n\n### Video type\n\nTalking head\n\n### Short description\n\nTeacher talking about how they used spaced practice.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How does the teacher space practice?\n- How are they helping pupils to remember content from last term?\n- Are there ways that you could incorporate spaced practice into your classroom?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/NrDDGIX5mA0)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In my class, I know that pupils are going to forget previously taught material\n  if I don’t revisit it. When I introduce an important new idea or concept, I\n  always plan when I will teach review lessons on it or re-introduce the\n  material after a few days or weeks. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  For example, for our half termly topics, after I teach pupils the key\n  vocabulary I might review it every day for the first week using short recall\n  quizzes to match the definitions up. Then, the following week I will only get\n  pupils to explicitly practise it on three days, maybe getting pupils to\n  practise using the vocabulary in writing or in a talk task. I will slowly\n  extend the gap between practice activities on the vocabulary and pupils should\n  start to use it in their writing without me prompting.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  We also do a weekly spelling test so I will include a few of the vocab words\n  in that and rotate them out and back in again. I always include some spelling\n  words from the last term’s topic as well so they don’t forget those while\n  learning new ones!\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nWhat makes practice purposeful? We know from lots of fields that _quality_ of practice is just as important as _quantity_ of practice. If you want to learn to play tennis, you will get better simply by playing a couple of times a week. However, if you really want to improve you will need to identify the key skills of the game and your weaknesses as a player, break the skills down so you understand them and commit to regular, focused practice of the component parts, building the level of difficulty, until they are second nature. You might need to pay a coach to give you feedback and you probably won’t stick to this plan unless you have clear goals for improvement either.\n\nThe same applies to purposeful practice in education. When planning practice activities, you should think about:\n\n- What do I want my pupils to be able to know or do well?\n\n  - What are the stages between where they are now and this objective?\n\n- How will this help pupils know what they do and don’t remember?\n\n  - Does the activity include answers so pupils can check?\n\n- How will pupils know what ‘good’ looks like?\n\n  - Does the activity include a model or worked example for pupils to refer back to?\n  - Will the pupil have access to their classwork or textbook so they can improve their answers?\n\n- How will pupils identify gaps and where they need more practice?\n\n  - Is there an opportunity to reflect and plan what they need to do next?\n\nYou will also need to think about how you – as an expert – can give them feedback. Practice with feedback is more effective than practice alone (Dunlosky, 2013). Not only does this help them improve over time, it also means that they will not practise incorrect material, and commit errors and misconceptions to their long-term memory (Rosenshine, 2012; Roedinger & Butler, 2011).\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nYear 8 PE Lesson - netball\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher giving feedback to their pupils\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How does the feedback from the teacher improve the quality of their practice?\n\n- How does the teacher help pupils to recognise:\n\n  - Where they are?\n  - Where they are going?\n  - What needs to be done to get there?\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  [Pupils are practicing running and catching the ball, pivoting and passing it\n  on. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The teacher notices one pair who are forgetting to stop and pivot.]\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher: OK girls, stop for a moment and watch me.

It is much\n  more effective for pupils to try to retrieve what they already know about a\n  topic,\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  or what they have recently read about it, from memory. Retrieval practice\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">involves retrieving something you have learned in the past and bringing it back to mind.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  You can use retrieval to review past learning before introducing new related\n  learning. For example, you might ask pupils to recall group one of the\n  periodic table before introducing group seven, showing its similarities and\n  differences. \n</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EEF (2018)</span>\n</p>\n$CTA\n\nRetrieval practice is effective because it requires ‘an effort from within’ to call information to mind, as opposed to just reading or hearing it (Roedinger & Butler, 2011). The evidence shows that because retrieval is an active behaviour, as opposed to passive, it stimulates our brains more and in the process helps to strengthen the existing memory. In other words, the more often you retrieve some information from your long-term memory the more likely it is to stay there.\n\nRetrieval practice also helps us to identify gaps in our knowledge. Through the struggle of trying to recall a piece of information, we are cognisant of what we do not remember. Being aware of what you do and do not know is an important feature of metacognition, which we know is an important part of successful learning (see Block 3).\n\nOne way many pupils choose to study is by re-reading notes, listening to explanations on YouTube or watching video animations. While this shouldn’t be discouraged, retrieval practices such as creating flashcards to quiz themselves, answering old exam questions or attempting to list out all of the key dates without looking at the textbook are much more powerful in aiding memory.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Using retrieval practice to promote learning</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think, pair, share –</span>{\" \"}\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      get pupils to think first of their response, and then share it with a\n      partner before contributing to the rest of the class.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-stakes quizzes –</span>{\" \"}\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      include content from previous lessons.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brain dumps –</span>{\" \"}\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      get pupils to put everything they know about a topic or a theme onto one\n      piece of paper.

As mentioned above, pupils retain information better if there is a gap between learning, practice and subsequent practice.\n\nYou could achieve this by:\n\n- Deciding on a particular day or week which you will incorporate practice activities into your lesson. For example, every Friday you will provide practice activities linked to previously learned material. You might include a new skill every week at first, and then every other week and then just once a month as you extend the time between pupils practicing that material.\n- Including previously learned material in homework tasks as an opportunity for pupils to practise.\n- Starting each day with a daily review or practice task, e.g. vocabulary, events or learning from the day, week or term before.\n- A weekly or half-termly quiz which pulls a mixture of questions from previously learned material as well as newly learned material.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Remember this</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key points:</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Practice is an important part of learning something.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Something is learned when it is in the long-term memory, representing a\n      lasting change.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupils tend to use ineffective study techniques such as underlining,\n      highlighting, passive re-reading of materials which does not aid long-term\n      recall.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Teachers should support pupils to learn more effective study techniques\n      through their design of learning tasks and instruction.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      When designing practice tasks teachers should consider:\n    </span>\n    <ul>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          How often the material should be practised\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          What time lag there should be between opportunities to practise it\n        </span>\n      </li>\n      <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n        <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n          What feedback will pupils get as they practise to know they correct.\n        </span>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Retrieval tasks are particularly effective at helping pupils to remember\n      material over time.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReference\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\nAdesope, O.

We can remember the awkwardness as we politely, but silently, negotiate who speaks first. There is the sense of danger as you weigh up whether being the person who records the ideas means you are excused from being the person who has to stand up and feed back, or if the fact that no-one can read your handwriting means that you will _have _to do it. We also remember the sense of frustration that one person is dominating the discussion, and that what they’re saying seems to be completely missing the point of the task. Bad group work is truly awful.\n\nAs a classroom teacher, you will probably have considerable control over the way you ask pupils to complete tasks. You will have learned a lot already about the practicalities of managing pupils in the classroom. When you first started teaching last year, you may have had grand plans for complex group activities only to find that managing behaviour and the ‘classroom traffic’ that this can create was a challenge. As a new teacher, this can take up a lot of your planning time and attention in class. You might have recognised that for many tasks, pupils can work effectively when working individually and as a result have minimised group work activities. This Block will give you the chance to think in detail about how to balance the benefits to pupils’ learning with classroom management and efficiency.\n\nThe evidence shows that planning opportunities for pupils to work, and in particular to practise, in both pairs and groups can increase their success:\n\n- Group work fosters cooperation between pupils and thereby develops pupils’ social skills.\n- It supports pupils to develop empathetic abilities and see things from multiple viewpoints.\n- Pupils learn to compromise.\n- Pupils can provide each other with scaffolding.\n- The total sum knowledge of a group is higher than that housed within one individual; this may allow the teacher to set work that is more challenging.\n- Pupils have the opportunity to restructure their own thinking by talking to others (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017).\n\nHowever, pupils will not automatically be good at this kind of activity and need to be taught how to do it well. You will also need to think carefully in your planning about the purpose of paired or group work in relation to pupils’ learning and the wider benefits to them: doing group work simply for its own sake may not be the best use of classroom time.\n\nYour role as teacher is to:\n\n- Explicitly teach pupils _how_ you want them to conduct paired and group work\n- Support pupils to learn how to do paired and group work well by providing support during tasks\n- Ensure that pupils have the opportunity to practise how to do paired and group work, recognising that it will take time for them to become skilled in it\n\nA number of elements can support group work to be effective. These include:\n\n- Familiarity with routines\n- Pupils’ prior knowledge in relation to the task\n- How pupils are grouped\n- Group goals, in which the group works together towards a shared goal, reward or recognition\n- Individual accountability, in which the success of the group depends on the individual learning of each group member\n\nHave a look at the two examples below.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  <b>Example A </b>\n  <b>‒</b>\n  <b> Informal</b> group<b> learning</b>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher has not planned explicitly for group work but feels that the\n      task should be performed in a group.\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Pupils are given a task to carry out as a group but the teacher does not\n      provide specific roles or guidance to the group beyond that they need to\n      work together to complete the task: ‘You’re going to work together to\n      complete the experiment, off you go.’\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Each pupil tends to carry out a separate activity which contributes to the\n      completion of the task, but this depends on how functional each group is. \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Rewards are provided to individuals within the task: ‘Now you have\n      completed the task, you need to write it up individually and I will mark\n      it.’\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  <b>Example B </b>\n  <b>‒</b> Structured<b> team learning</b>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher has planned explicitly for group work within the lesson,\n      planning that there will be specific roles for pupils within each group:\n      ‘Number 1s will find out about the reactions of Group 1 metals.

[…] For small group work to be effective, a number of\n    elements need to be taken into account in the structuring of the task.

You will need to think about what each person within the group is going to do and why working in that way is likely to yield a benefit. For example, you might be teaching an English lesson which is exploring different characters' viewpoints. Grouping pupils for this task where they take on the viewpoint of a different character can help to bring the story alive. You might want pupils to complete a difficult piece of work – using mixed attainment groupings in this instance can help to support pupils of lower attainment. However, it is important to be mindful that the higher-attainment pupil doesn’t simply ‘take over’. It seems obvious, but you will also need to think carefully about the likely social dynamics of certain groupings: some pairs will demonstrate excellent social skills without much learning taking place!\n\nYou may get ‘free-riders’ within groups (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). That is, pupils who are able to hide within a group situation and avoid completing work. Johnson & Johnson (1994) suggest that one way to mitigate against this is to assign pupils with clear roles. Using the same roles consistently in different group tasks will help pupils to become familiar with the routines of group work. Knowing what the different roles are, how each role contributes to the group task and practically what to do in each role is important pre-knowledge for pupils to be able to perform the roles and therefore the group work successfully. In different activities, these might include:\n\n- **The summarizer**, who will prepare the group’s presentation to the class and summarize conclusions reached to see if the rest of the group agrees.\n- **The researcher**, who collects background information and looks up any additional information that is needed to complete the task.\n- **The checker**, who checks that the facts the group will use are indeed correct and will stand up to scrutiny from the teacher or other groups.\n- **The runner**, who tries to find the resources needed to complete the task, such as equipment and dictionaries.\n- **The observer/trouble-shooter**, who takes notes and records group processes; these may be used during the debriefing following the group work.\n- **The recorder**, who writes down the major output of the group, and synthesises the work of other group members.\n\nOne simple way to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation is to ensure that you record how you have grouped pupils and make observations about attainment, behaviour and motivation based on that grouping. You can also give individual and group scores to pupils for work they have carried out in groups thus increasing individual accountability for the work carried out within a group. This should be carried out while pupils are working in groups so that it does not create unnecessary workload for you or take additional time for them.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nSetting up a group activity\n\n### Video type\n\nClassroom practice\n\n### Short description\n\nA teacher explains how she would like the groups to be set up for an activity.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- How does the teacher communicate her expectations of group work?\n- What are the different roles pupils are being asked to take on?\n- What is the impact of this?\n- The group work task comes after a series of lessons developing foundational knowledge.

For example, in some schools, pupils are grouped by attainment for classes in ‘core’ subjects such as maths, English and science and in mixed-ability groups for ‘non-core’ subjects (setting) or in all subjects (streaming). In other schools, there is no ability grouping at all. Primary schools may take a similar variety of approaches, grouping pupils by ability for some, all or none of the subjects and lessons throughout the week.\n\nThis is a hot topic: ‘ability grouping has been one of the most controversial educational practices for more than a century’ (Steenbergen et al., 2016). As a classroom teacher, you may not have full control over the decisions your school makes with respect to this. However, you do have a lot of control over how you group pupils within your classes.\n\nDifferent forms of grouping seem to create different opportunities for effectively adapting teaching to students’ needs (Deunk et al., 2018). The evidence suggests that grouping pupils flexibly within classes is effective as it enables you to provide tailored support. This might be done in a couple of main ways:\n\n- **Homogenous or within-class attainment groupings**\n\nThis means pupils of very similar prior attainment level working together for specific activities or topics such as literacy. This might involve pupils of similar levels of current attainment being grouped together on specific tables for example, but all pupils being taught by their usual teacher and support staff and following the same curriculum (EEF, 2018).\n\nThe aim of this type of grouping is to match tasks, activities and support to pupils’ current capabilities, so that all pupils have an appropriate level of challenge while maintaining high expectations and access to a rich curriculum. This might enable you to spend more time with lower attainment pupils, using in-lesson intervention as an effective and efficient way to support them. The evidence on within-class attainment grouping indicates that it is likely to be beneficial for all learners, providing an average benefit of three months’ additional progress. However, there appears to be less benefit for lower-attaining pupils than for others. In England, within-class attainment grouping tends to be more common in primary than in secondary schools (EEF, 2018).\n\n- **Heterogeneous or mixed attainment groupings\n  **\n\nThis means that pupils of diverse attainment levels are grouped together. This might allow for within-group scaffolding to take place, i.e. higher attaining pupils are able to provide support to lower ability pupils. There are some known positive effects for higher-attaining pupils of taking on this role.\n\nIt is important that you do not stick to one type of grouping, especially within-class attainment groups, because you run the risk of creating a perception that attainment is fixed. There can be particular implications for pupils who are considered low-attainment. Groups should be flexible _between subjects_, i.e. groups for literacy are not the same for maths and revert to normal mixed groups for other subjects, and – over time – can be changed regularly in line with assessment data.\n\n$I\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Th</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  e findings of the research on the effects of grouping by attainment on the\n  academic and personal outcomes of students have suggested positive benefits\n  for students assigned to high groups (Kulik &amp; Kulik, 1982; Kerckhoff,\n  1986; Ireson &amp; Hallam, 2001). The progress of students in lower groups,\n  however, was found to be delayed by one or two months each year, and their\n  confidence and engagement were undermined (Higgins et al., 2015).\n</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Steenbergen et al., 2016)</span>\n</p>\n$I\n\n## Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set\n\nDifferent schools will have different approaches to homework. The most important thing to remember about homework is that it is the _quality_ and not the quantity that counts.\n\n### Potential benefits of homework\n\n| Short-term                                                                                                                                                                                 | Long-term                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| - Better retention of facts and knowledge - Increased understanding - Improved information processing skills - Improved critical thinking skills - Possibility of extending the curriculum | - Development of better study habits - Development of better attitudes towards school - Encouragement of learning outside school hours - Independent learning - Time organisation |\n\nMost schools will have a policy in relation to homework in terms of when and how much should be set. As a classroom teacher, you will not have control over this. However, it is likely that you have considerable control over the _type_ of homework set. It is difficult to isolate the effects of homework from other factors that might contribute to pupils’ achievement. The benefits of homework are largely dependent on its _quality_ and the extent to which it relates to what pupils need to learn within the class. For example, if pupils are set an entirely discrete homework project for a term that does not relate to what they are learning in lessons, it is likely that there will be fewer gains in progress.\n\nMuijs & Reynolds (2017) exemplify this approach by suggesting several principles to follow, including:\n\n- It should be integrated into the lesson or topic studied. One way to do this is to review homework at the start of the lesson. Homework is seen as an integral part of the lesson.\n- Reinforces major curriculum ideas – homework should be challenging but pupils should be able to complete it successfully.\n- Use a homework planner.\n\nHomework is an ideal opportunity to apply what you learnt in Block 8 about effective study habits and increasing the chances of leaning ‘sticking’. Homework should complement your in-class work and your overall goals for what pupils will learn. Some ways you can do this include:\n\n- Use homework tasks as an opportunity to balance repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills (e.g. include a section on previously learnt material in homework tasks).\n- Plan regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time – when you plan a topic or scheme of work, also plan when pupils will revisit it through homework at later points in the year.\n- Provide just enough support so pupils experience high success rates with challenging work – include worked examples or partially completed examples at the start of homework tasks.\n- Increase the challenge by lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements, such as how this new topic interacts with a previously leant idea or concept.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\nDeunk, M.

It helps if you organise the classroom so that tables are in groups. Pupils should have necessary prior knowledge (such as how to work in a group) to be successful.\n\nHome team = mixed attainment grouping\n\nAway team = prior attainment grouping\n\nPupils have a group activity to complete as the Home team. In order to complete the activity, they need to go and work in their Away team on one aspect. This aspect can be tailored to pupil prior attainment.\n\n#### Example\n\nPupils are learning about how methods of police investigation have changed in the 20th Century ‒ they need to find out about DNA, fingerprints, CCTV, witness interviews. Pupils need to go to the Away team to find out about a particular method. The work can be tailored for the attainment group through:\n\n- Complexity of content\n- Amount of scaffolding\n- Adult support at the Away team table\n\nPupils will then return to their Home team and each take a turn at teaching the others in their group about what they learned with their Away team.\n\n### Talk partners\n\nPupil talk is a valuable way to support pupils with being able to write well later down the line. Ensuring high quality pupil talk is something which needs to be taught and practised. Using ‘Talk partners’ in your classroom is one effective way to do this. It’s likely you are already doing this to some extent already because you ask pupils to ‘discuss with the person sat next to you’. ‘Think, pair, share’ is a similar process.\n\nUsing talk partners explicitly and regularly changes the dynamics of talk in the classroom. In a traditional classroom, talk is often between teacher and pupil. This can lead to some pupils who are confident dominating talk in the classroom and leaves other pupils with an option to ‘opt-out’ if they feel like it. By using talk partners and providing scaffolding (e.g. on key vocabulary or structures) all pupils have the opportunity to practise articulating their ideas.\n\nWhen you pose some questions in your next lesson, instead of expecting pupils to respond to you, use talk partners so pupils can first share their thoughts and ideas with each other.\n\nIt is useful to mix up talk partners every few weeks so that it avoids the idea that this grouping is fixed and allows pupils to interact with others in their class.\n\n### Intentionally monitoring group performance\n\nSo that you can start to really understand what types of groupings are working well in your lessons, it would be worthwhile monitoring them intentionally.\n\nYou could use the grid as modelled below to do this.\n\n|                                                                            |         |         |         |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n|                                                                            | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 |\n| Who is in the group?                                                       |         |         |         |\n| How well have they completed the task (attainment)?                        |         |         |         |\n| How well did they work together (behaviour)?                               |         |         |         |\n| How motivated were they as a group to complete the task well (motivation)? |         |         |         |\n\nIt would be useful to share your findings (sensitively). If a group activity did not go well, it is not about never doing it again but finding ways to improve performance. One way to do this is to make sure pupils understand what their group could have done better.\n\nFor example: ‘I am going to give you some feedback on how we did that group activity. I thought Group X performed really well. I heard them speaking politely to each other. I heard them asking each other good questions. As a result, their work is very good. Group Y did not do so well at supporting each other through the task – you got annoyed with each other when you thought it wasn’t going well. What could you do differently next time?’\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <b>\n      <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do next?</span>\n    </b>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "97e477ed-5cc6-4ea7-987e-e6fa3078a708"],

We know that\n  pupils are likely to forget what they have learnt without specific strategies\n  to support them in transferring knowledge to their long-term memory, as\n  covered in Block 2 and 8. We will look at tasks that support pupils to learn\n  key ideas securely, and that build automatic recall of key knowledge through\n  retrieval and spaced practice. In this way you can help pupils apply knowledge\n  and skills to other contexts, and to think critically, by drawing attention to\n  the underlying structure of problems and how concrete examples can lead to\n  abstract ones. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  In the self-directed study materials, we will look specifically at how to help\n  pupils build more complex mental models.

The following list summarises key content from your first year. Read through it carefully to remind yourself about these key aspects of how pupils learn.\n\n- Information in our long-term memory is organised into schemata.\n- We can think of these schemata as ‘interconnected webs’ of information.\n- ‘Learning’ is about developing our schema: adding new information, forging new connections and strengthening the existing connections between ideas.\n- The more complex and interconnected our schemata are, the easier it is to make sense of new, related information.\n\n## Building complex mental models\n\nIn Block 4, we looked at why subject knowledge is important and how it is constructed. You looked at how understanding builds on prior knowledge and the need to sequence pupils’ learning and address their misconceptions. Much of the focus was on how your knowledge of the subject(s) you teach would support pupils to develop their knowledge.\n\nIn this section, we are going to take things a step further, looking at how these basic principles can be used to support pupils to develop more complex _mental models_.\n\nWhat do we mean by this?\n\nIn one sense, mental models are how we understand the world: they are a representation of how something works. Pupils will develop more complex mental models as they accumulate new knowledge. For example, in Early Years pupils will learn concepts of right and wrong and what rules are. As they gain new knowledge through experience and direct teaching of new ideas in KS2 and KS3, such as morals, rights and responsibilities and eventually citizenship and how the law works, they will develop a more complex mental model related to why we have rules and how and when rules should be applied. As pupils develop a more sophisticated mental model they may behave in different ways, for example understanding that their behaviour can hurt somebody else and so the rule or law needs to be followed.\n\nWe will look at how, as a teacher, you can help your pupils develop more and more sophisticated understandings of the main concepts in a subject, returning to them again and again. We will also look at how this process helps reinforce pupils’ understanding by strengthening their schemata. Now that you are becoming more settled and confident in your teaching, you will be able to think more about your longer-term planning, taking a bigger-picture view than you do with individual lessons.\n\nHow do we do this?\n\n## You should revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples\n\nIt is important to identify the key ideas in a subject. They are the important concepts from which other subject concepts are linked or inferred (Ball et al., 2008), the ones that provide the foundation upon which everything else builds. We know that students learn new ideas by reference to ideas they already know (Deans for Impact, 2015). Mastering the big ideas of a subject will make other knowledge and skills accessible, helping pupils unpick new ideas and think deeply and critically about the subject you are teaching.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nA planning meeting\n\n### Video type\n\nDiscussion\n\n### Short description\n\nYear 5 teaching team (2 teachers) are planning their next term topic on the Vikings.\n\n### What should you focus on in this video?\n\n- What are the key concepts or ideas that the teachers identify in their planning?\n- How do they plan to revisit the big ideas over time?\n- How do the teachers plan to reference what pupils already know?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/QfEfPgchhGA)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher 1: I really like the idea of us doing all the practical activities\n  around Viking clothes, food and settlements but one thing I think we really\n  need to emphasise is the theme of invasion. It’s a key concept in history not\n  just with the Vikings and it sometimes gets side-lined with all of the other\n  activities. Understanding the impact of an invasion is really important. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher 2: I agree. It links to their topic in year 3 on the Romans so maybe\n  we could make a point of asking pupils to think about the Roman invasion and\n  what impact that had on daily life – I'm thinking things like religion as well\n  as clothes. Then we can set an overall objective for pupils to compare the\n  impact of the Viking invasion this term with the impact of the Roman invasion.\n  What do you think?\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher 1: Good idea. We will need to think about how to activate their prior\n  knowledge – maybe we can take them to look at the display in the Hall from\n  this year 3? \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Teacher 2: They did a lot of work on cause and effect last term in History so\n  it will be really helpful to continue building on that using the same writing\n  frames and sentence stems. Comparing impact is going to be hard for some of\n  them so we will need to plan carefully around that...\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nAs you established in Block 4, when supporting pupils in mastering these fundamental ideas or concepts it is necessary to be certain they are securely learned. Often this means revisiting these concepts again and again over time, coming at them from different directions. For example, in mathematics place value is a key idea which underpins many other linked topics, such as addition and subtraction. Therefore, place value, once identified as a key idea, would need to be explicitly taught and revisited many times to ensure pupils master this.\n\nThis broad and deep understanding of foundational concepts takes time and should be an important consideration in your planning. Look at the table below for ideas on how to do this in practice:\n\n| What to do                                                                                                                          | How to do it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Identify the big ideas of the subjects you teach (these are the key ideas, principles, concepts upon which everything else builds). | Look at resources and consult with more experienced colleagues to answer the following questions:- What are the things that will provide a foundation for learning in the subjects you teach and will ‘unlock’ other knowledge and skills? _(For example, recognising sentence structures is key to being successful in English as pupils need this to analyse texts and to write effectively themselves.)_ - What is essential for pupils to know and do to be successful in the subjects you teach? _(In History, pupils would need to know what ‘bias’ means before looking at sources.)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Make the big ideas the focus of your long-term planning.                                                                            | You want pupils to have a depth of knowledge around the big ideas so that they can access other parts of the subject:- Begin planning with the big ideas in mind. - Work out where they fit into your long-term plan before anything else. - When do the key concepts and principles need to come in the sequence to ensure that pupils are able to access other parts of the subject?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Revisit and repeat these big ideas over time in a meaningful way.                                                                   | Coming back to these ideas repeatedly is key to making them ‘stick’ in pupils’ minds:- Plan when you will revisit the big ideas over time to ensure deep learning. - Think how you will assess progress towards real understanding of the big ideas. - Use subject-specific language repeatedly. At all phases, pupils can be introduced and inducted into these ways of being in and knowing the world from the subject’s point of view. It will help them to build schema (see Block 2 and 4). This includes learning the specific, sometimes technical, language of the subject, and applying this language when talking about the subject and learning new, and more complex, things (EEF, 2018). - Reduce the cognitive load by scaffolding learning to support pupils in learning the big ideas.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Take a variety of approaches to address the big ideas.                                                                              | Thinking of different ways of illustrating these big ideas, coming at them from different angles, will help reinforce the concepts:- Exemplify the concept in lots of different ways. _(In Science you might use atoms to underpin and explain chemical reactions and then in another lesson use them to explain energy. In English you might teach rhythm in poetry through limericks at first and later on look at meter through iambic pentameter.)_ - Use the big ideas to activate prior knowledge. _(For example, in History your pupils might already have covered the concept of democracy and you might have a short quiz to activate this prior knowledge before beginning a lesson on human rights.)_ - Create a variety of tasks that ask pupils to use the big ideas. _(For example, in Biology you might ask pupils to complete a worksheet around evolution for homework and you might set a paired task to solve a key question around evolution.)_ |\n\n## You should discuss curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balance exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge\n\nAs you explored in Block 4, it is important that you carefully consider how you sequence learning. In this Block, you will be building on your knowledge of sequencing to consider how you balance exposition, repetition of key concepts and skills, and provide sufficient time for pupils to practise critical skills or knowledge. More experienced teachers consider these issues for sequences of lessons.\n\nRead through the following teacher’s explanation of how they think about the key elements in their planning and answer the questions that follow:\n\n$I\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Designing a long-term plan adopts many of the same principles as designing a\n  shorter sequence of learning. I start by thinking carefully about what it is I\n  need pupils to know by the end. This allows me to focus on what's important. I\n  think about how I will test that pupils have learned this information at the\n  end through summative assessment but also how I will assess them throughout.\n  We probably do some sort of rapid quiz most lessons – certainly once a week.\n  This is good for me as I can see what each of them knows, but good for them\n  too as it helps to reinforce the learning. Retrieving what they know helps\n  strengthen their schemata.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I work backwards from the end point, thinking about how I will build pupils'\n  knowledge and skills to be able to fully understand the key concepts by the\n  end. I consider what the foundational knowledge is that pupils need as the\n  building blocks for learning and map these out, thinking about how I will\n  explicitly teach these. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I </span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  spend a lot of time thinking about the initial presentation of these ideas,\n  and I often write out a version of what I want to say to make it as clear as\n  possible. I always try to find clear graphical versions of what I’m saying to\n  reinforce the message, such as using diagrams or images in order to make\n  abstract ideas as concrete as possible. I also think hard about how to make\n  sure each step of the exposition is clear before moving on to the next bit. If\n  necessary, I will work through a model of the type of task I’m asking them to\n  do, explaining my thinking at each stage.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I plan how I will repeat key ideas and concepts – I know that it is important\n  that pupils have more than a surface-level understanding of these so I know I\n  need to revisit and cover them in a number of different ways. I plan to space\n  this out so concepts are addressed several times and I will assess pupils'\n  understanding at each point. When I first started, I was concerned that this\n  would be boring for the pupils, but I actually like the challenge of coming at\n  the core concepts in different ways now. I’ve explained to the pupils why we\n  do this – how it helps them to learn.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I plan opportunities for independent practice, such as independent pupil\n  writing. This will have been supported over the weeks of learning by explicit\n  teaching of the concepts and high-quality modelling so that by the time I ask\n  them to do something on their own, they have the tools to do it. When we're\n  first working with a new idea or skill, I provide really structured practice,\n  making sure I give them lots of guidance and feedback until they have really\n  understood it. For example, after I’ve been through and explained how I would\n  approach a task, we might do two or three more examples with the class telling\n  me how they’d do each step.\n</span>\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How does the teacher ensure that the pupils learn ‘what is important’?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Why does the teacher plan to repeat key concepts?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      The teacher describes two different types of practice - what are they?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$CTA\n\nWhile you will have built up good experience of planning over the last few months, teachers at every stage of their careers benefit from drawing on the expertise of their peers. In your mentor sessions in this Block, you will be working with an experienced colleague to discuss curriculum design.\n\n## You should draw explicit links between the new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject\n\nWhen introducing a new concept to our pupils, there are five key strategies that we can use to support them in developing strong conceptual understanding:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The flowchart lists five stages in the effective introduction of a new concept:&lt;p>&lt;/p>1) Begin with what pupils already know&lt;p>&lt;/p>2) Provide a clear explanation&lt;p>&lt;/p>3) Use examples to support understanding&lt;p>&lt;/p>4) Take steps to address common misconceptions&lt;p>&lt;/p>5) Plan opportunities for retrieval and spacing. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-10.2.1-Introducing-New-Concepts-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThe following table explains why each of these strategies supports pupils to develop strong conceptual understanding and explains how this could be done in practice.\n\n| What?                                                                                                     | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | How?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Begin with what pupils already know (this could include revisiting the big ideas of a subject over time). | When we introduce a new concept, we can help pupils store it in their long-term memory by making explicit links to the big ideas that they are already familiar with.

Making concepts explicit through carefully paced explanation, modeling and examples can help ensure that students are not overwhelmed (Deans for Impact, 2015).This will alleviate the potential for future misconceptions or confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - Provide a meaningful definition of the concept using vocabulary and complexity of language which your pupils understand. - Consider the specific qualities or characteristics of this concept that pupils need to be aware of. - Decide how you can best communicate these to your pupils, including the use of verbal explanations, concrete examples, demonstrations, models or resources. - Build on the explanations you have used in communicating the big ideas in the subjects you teach, e.g. returning to examples or ‘themes’ which you are all familiar with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Use examples to support understanding.                                                                    | The simplest way to identify the qualities of a concept is to begin with a concrete example because:- It is easier for us to understand concrete ideas than it is to understand abstract ideas. - If we illustrate an abstract concept with a concrete example, pupils are more likely to understand and remember it (e.g. ‘scarcity’ by showing how budget airline flights fill up closer to departure).Most importantly, we should try to provide pupils with multiple examples or representations of an idea, as this will help them to gain a broader and deeper conceptual understanding.We should also consider including non-examples alongside our examples – this helps pupils to understand the subtle nuances of what a concept is and also what it isn't. | We can share examples in a range of formats. Our examples might be presented as part of our lesson content or we might provide experiences for our pupils.**Concrete examples:**- Pictures and illustrations - Descriptions - Video/audio clips - Stories - Scenarios - Analogies and metaphors. We must remember that analogies are effective only if we elaborate on them, and direct student attention to the crucial similarities between existing knowledge and what is to be learned (Deans for Impact (2015).**Experiences:**- Direct observation - Trip or visit - Role play - Virtual experience - Personal recollections                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Take steps to address common misconceptions.                                                              | When planning an explanation, we need to ensure we think about how we are going to address common misconceptions. Once misconceptions are embedded in the long-term memory, they can be difficult to undo. It is better to address them before or as soon after they occur as possible (Willingham, 2009).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Identify possible misconceptions:**Ask yourself:**- What misconceptions might pupils already hold? This could link to their understanding of the big ideas that link to this topic.- What do pupils typically misunderstand about this topic?**Ask your colleagues:**- What common mistakes or errors do pupils make when applying this concept in practice? - Who else could I talk to in my team who might have experience of teaching this concept before?Plan to prevent misconceptions forming:- Is there another way of communicating this concept that will reduce the likelihood of misconceptions taking hold?                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Plan for opportunities for multiple exposure.                                                             | Pupils need to encounter complete sets of information several times in order to fully understand the concept.The implication here is that we need to find ways to repeat and revisit our explanations throughout a lesson sequence for our teaching to be most effective. We should space practice over time, with content being reviewed across weeks or months, to help students remember that content over the long term (Deans for Impact, 2015).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Plan learning so that skills and knowledge are revisited multiple times over the course of a sequence of lessons. - Where appropriate to the age and stage of pupils, use a starter activity to expose pupils to content/skills they learned in the previous lesson. - Plan for opportunities for pupils to retrieve information. Making this low-stakes and formative will not only help you get a sense of where the class is in terms of their subject knowledge, it will also help pupils to create and be secure in their background knowledge (Bailin et al., 1999). Importantly, it can also support pupils to determine the level of their own subject knowledge, and any gaps. The activity will also serve to reinforce prior learning and provide a starting point for new learning (Coe et al., 2014). |\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nBall, D.

Embed opportunities for pupils to practise making links and connections between their new learning and the big ideas that underpin the subject.\n\nYou could ask:\n\n- Is there a key idea we have covered that helps you understand this topic?\n- When else have we covered similar ideas?\n- Can you think of another character similar to this one? What makes them similar?\n- How might you link this idea to (diversity / mass / grammar and meaning / product life-cycle)?\n\n#### **Draw pupil attention to structures and links**\n\nPupils will not be able to make links between what they do not know so make sure that they have a good understanding of the big ideas that they will need in order to build a shared understanding of the subject. Once they have a secure foundation of knowledge built on the big ideas you identified, you can use this to help pupils make sense of new concepts.\n\nPractise using structures pupils already know in new contexts: _‘we know this is the formula for X and you have practised using it for X, how could you use it here?’_\n\nCover the same concept in different forms: _‘What does this diagram show us about X?_’\n\nUse every opportunity for retrieval as an opportunity to build connections: _‘The quick quiz you did at the beginning of this lesson tested you on your understanding of X. Keep your answers in mind as we look at this…’_\n\n#### **Plan retrieval opportunities for the core concepts and principles and use these to help pupils form new connections.**\n\nPlan retrieval opportunities in places that will help pupils form new connections. This will not only strengthen and reinforce the big ideas but support pupils to make links between new content and existing knowledge.\n\n- Use low stakes quizzes to reinforce learning of key concepts and to support pupils to make links. _For example, you might set a short quiz on descriptive techniques as a starter activity in a lesson in which pupils are asked to write descriptively._\n- Consciously space out practice over time. When planning out your curriculum map, actively plan out when pupils will be quizzed on the core concepts and principles to match the learning outcome of the lesson.\n- Use think/pair/share to get pupils to consider their learning of the big ideas and make connections: ‘_In silence you are going to have a go at working out the challenge on the board.

It gives us information which helps us\n  respond to pupils through further teaching or feedback that pupils can act on.\n  Effective assessment should always drive pupil learning.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  No doubt, you have created brilliant assessment tasks and issued high-quality,\n  purposeful, personalised feedback which has supported teaching and learning.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It is important to remember that assessment can be part of existing\n  interactions with pupils and therefore not add to your workload.  In Block 5,\n  you explored how to ensure your assessment always matches the objectives,\n  which will have saved you time and made sure the data you gather is always\n  useful and practical. You probably still have moments when assessment takes up\n  much of your time - planning, facilitating and marking - but this is\n  undoubtedly something that will be refined and improved over time. In this\n  Block, you will be encouraged to work with your colleagues to find more\n  efficient approaches which will support you to manage your workload further. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Now in Year 2, we will support you to build on your learning and initial\n  successes by deepening your knowledge in this area and developing further\n  practical strategies. You will go beyond looking at what makes effective\n  assessment to focus on how you can link assessment to metacognitive\n  strategies. This builds on the work you did in Block 3 in this area. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  You will also look at how to ensure feedback is of high quality: that it is\n  specific, helpful, and drives learning forward. You will look in detail at\n  strategies you can use to scaffold self-assessments, to provide model work\n  that supports learning, and to always ensure you are giving effective verbal\n  feedback. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  We will also spend some time looking specifically at peer- and\n  self-assessment. These strategies are often presented as a way to increase\n  efficiency. However, the time saved is just time wasted unless pupils are\n  doing this really well! You will explore how you can structure and facilitate\n  self- and peer-assessment so it can be a valuable tool within the classroom.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n", nil, "1831bf85-a2b3-4011-b449-dc5b1b672103"],

This might be because you are working with a small group during an activity or it is an independent learning task, such as homework or self-study. In the longer term, you won’t be their teacher forever! You want to avoid a situation whereby all learning is dependent on you, the teacher, being available to offer support and guidance. To achieve this, you will need to think about how to support your pupils to self-regulate and to monitor their own learning.\n\nThis will not be automatic. In fact, pupils will need regular feedback on their attempts to monitor and regulate (i.e. take control of) their own learning. Over time, they will be able to do it without your support and this will both reduce your workload and mean that your pupils can make better progress in their learning.\n\nYou learned about metacognition and some strategies for teaching it as part of Block 3. You will remember that the EEF Guidance Report on Meta-Cognition & Self Regulated Learning (2017) tells us ‘self-regulated learners are aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and can motivate themselves to engage in, and improve, their learning’.\n\nThere are three aspects to self-regulation; cognition, meta-cognition and motivation (EEF, 2017). All three are important, inter-dependent aspects of the learning process and you will need to consider each one carefully when thinking about how to help pupils monitor and regulate their own learning.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key terms</h3>\n<b>Cognition</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  : the mental processes involved in knowing, understanding and learning.\n  Cognitive strategies include memorisation techniques or subject-specific\n  strategies like how to solve an equation.\n</span>\n\n<b>Metacognition</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  : the ways learners monitor and purposefully direct their learning.\n  Meta-cognitive strategies include planning what technique to use, monitoring\n  if it is working and choosing to adapt if it is not.\n</span>\n\n<b>Motivation</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  : our willingness to engage in meta-cognitive or cognitive strategies.

Be aware that because we cannot _see_ cognitive strategies, we are commenting on surface-level evidence. Therefore, feedback might include:\n\n- Restructuring understanding\n- Confirming to students that they are correct or incorrect\n- Indicating that more information is available or needed\n- Pointing to directions students could pursue, and/or\n- Indicating alternative strategies to understand particular information.\n\n(Hattie & Timperley, 2007)\n\nGiving feedback on cognitive processes will help expand pupil awareness of which cognitive strategies worked and what they could try next time.\n\n## Video\n\n### Title\n\nCommenting on cognitive strategies\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Watch the video below and answer the following questions:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    How does the teacher identify which cognitive strategies the pupil has used?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    How does the teacher give feedback on the effectiveness of these strategies?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    How does the feedback help the pupil to try new cognitive strategies in the\n    future?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nTeacher: “Yasin, can you tell me how you solved the problem?”\n\nYasin: “First, I read all of the information and I noticed that the alarm is going off every 12 minutes and the light flashing every 8 minutes so to find out when they must both go at the same time I know I can multiply 12 and 8 to find a common multiple.”\n\nTeacher: “So, you identified the key information from the problem, 12 minutes and 8 minutes, and you recognised that you would need to find a common multiple of 12 and 8. You used a good strategy to multiply 12x8 to calculate a time when both 12 and 8 would be going off. This has worked, but I wonder whether you considered if this would be the <em>first</em> time that the alarm and light would go off at the same time? Is there another possible answer which comes before 96?”\n\nYasin: “Hmm. I guess so. I didn’t really think about it.”\n\nTeacher: “You have already identified that there needs to be a common multiple for 12 and 8 so why don’t you start listing all of your multiples of 12 and 8 to try and spot a lower common multiple”.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nIn Block 3, you learnt about the importance of explicit instruction on metacognitive strategies for pupils so they could more effectively plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning. Knowing how they learn and awareness of their learning through meta-cognition is the first step to being a self-regulated learner. After you have explicitly taught pupils the metacognitive strategies which they should use for a task, you can give specific feedback in relation to them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- “You have clearly **planned** this essay, demonstrated through your coherent structure and the sequencing of key points. You need to **monitor** your time more effectively as you can see that the earlier paragraphs are longer and more detailed, but towards the end of the essay your points become less convincing as they are less developed with quotes and evidence.”\n- “From your working out, I can see that you **evaluated** that you had made a mis-calculation by checking whether your answer worked. This is an excellent strategy and allowed you to go back and make the correction.”\n- “Next time, you should **plan** how you will explain the characteristics by listing them out first. This means you will be less likely to forget one!”\n\nOver time, as pupils have opportunities to respond to your feedback on their metacognitive strategies, they will develop the skills for themselves. As they get older, they will naturally begin to do this more, but with effective feedback this will happen sooner.\n\nAs Wiliam & Christadoulou (2017) tell us, ‘students will only act on feedback if they believe they can get better and so motivating students to believe in improvement itself becomes a key part of the challenge’. Not all types of feedback are equally effective in promoting learning (Hattie & Timperley, 2007) so it makes sense to start with those for which we have good evidence of effectiveness. Related to each, there are specific things you can do to support pupils in monitoring their own responses:\n\n|                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **How to support pupils to self-regulate**  | **What does this look like in practice**                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Provide individual feedback                 | - Personalise feedback. - Provide feedback to each pupil.                                                                                                                                  |\n| Focus on improvement                        | - Tell pupils what they need to do to improve. - Provide specific steps. - Outline the process pupils need to take to improve their response.                                              |\n| Focus on the work rather than the pupil     | - Keep feedback positive. - Ensure feedback is non-judgemental. - Comment on the work produced. - Keep comments constructive and supportive.                                               |\n| Provide feedback on ways to learn           | - Share the most effective ways to learn with pupils. - Show your pupils what good looks like. - Show pupils the value of putting effort in to improving and editing their work.           |\n| Help pupils set realistic, achievable goals | - Model goal-setting. - Encourage your pupils to reflect on where they are and where they want to be. - Show pupils how to set targets for themselves. - Help pupils track their progress. |\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Thinking about the table above, how do you support pupils to monitor their\n      own learning? \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What further steps will you take?</span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nHattie, J., &amp; Timperley, H.

Working with and learning from more experienced colleagues is the single most useful thing you can do to scaffold your progress as a teacher. As you will no doubt be aware, assessment can take up a considerable amount of your time and this in turn can have a significant impact on your workload. Gibson (2015) tells us that the most commonly reported ‘burdensome’ task is recording, inputting, monitoring and analysing data.\n\nColleagues will be able to provide ideas they have found work well with your pupils, especially in terms of how they manage to gather evidence from _all_ pupils in the class and then use this to adapt how they respond with their teaching. If you teach the same phase or subject, you may even be able to directly adapt their assessment materials for your pupils. You spent some time during the Block 5 Mentor Sessions engaging with colleagues on this topic: it would be valuable to continue this now that you are in your second year and looking to refine your practice.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Working with colleagues</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  These are some questions you could ask colleagues about assessment and\n  feedback: \n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      What steps do you take to make assessment efficient?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How do you get the information needed?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      How do you provide effective feedback?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Try and expand the network of colleagues who you look to for support in this\n  area. For example, it can be useful to talk to colleagues from outside your\n  phase / department as it can help give you a different perspective. Your\n  school may well have teachers who are identified as excellent practitioners.\n  It would be worthwhile seeking these individuals out.{\" \"}\n</span>\n$I\n\nEfficiency is not just about tackling the bottom-line issue of workload. Effective time management is about prioritisation and trade-offs. You should seek to spend the largest amount of your time on activities which directly and indirectly improve pupils' learning, and to minimise time where the benefit is less clear. Ideally, you will do all tasks – beneficial or not – in an efficient way, without compromising the quality and impact of what you do. Marking and whole-class feedback is an area where there is a lot of benefit to be gained and a lot of time to be saved. Techniques that increase the efficiency of assessment should therefore become integral to your teaching.

For example:Ο = circle any incorrect or missing punctuation﹏ = squiggly line underneath a part of writing that doesn’t make sense// = new paragraph needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Use group targets | Sometimes, when you mark a class’s work, you will notice that pupils are making similar mistakes and you are having to write the same feedback each time. In this case, you could create a single feedback sheet with numbered points which you (a) write up on a PowerPoint slide and (b) note the corresponding number in each pupils’ book when they make this error. At the start of the lesson, pupils need to note down their specific feedback (e.g. numbers 1, 4 and 5) from the slide and are given time to act on it.For example:1. You need to revisit the section on the effects of the earthquake and ensure that you have described at least 3 effects. 2. You need to ensure that you justify your reasons. For example, “I think the most significant effect was because...Doing this can free up time for you to write an effective model answer, produce a worked example or plan to reteach an element. Pupils seeing what good looks like is very important to their improvement. |\n| Use highlighters  | When you are marking work, you will tend to pick out the parts of the work that have been completed well and show the pupil the areas that need to be improved. A more efficient way of doing this could be to use different colour highlighters to indicate these. This will also mean that pupils have to do the detective work to identify what specifically needs to be improved.For example:Green – what has been done well Orange – spelling mistakes Pink – grammatical errorsAs with all effective marking, you will need to pick a couple of things for each. Avoid highlighting large sections of the pupils’ work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## Supporting effective self- and peer-assessment\n\nSelf- and peer-assessment are often touted as a way of increasing the efficiency of assessment. This is where you ask pupils to either mark their own work or mark the work of a peer. The trouble is, unless pupils are good at this, the marking they do will be ineffective, or potentially even damaging to learning. Rather than avoiding these practices – for which there is good evidence of effectiveness when done well – you should guide and support your pupils to do them well. Typically, this will be done by providing examples of the standard you are looking for and providing clear, accurate and explicit guidance on the features of these good pieces of work.\n\nConsider the following strategies for supporting pupils to do self- and peer-assessment well:\n\n### Supporting self- and peer-assessment\n\n| Strategy                                                            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Exemplification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Use models - sometimes known as WAGOLL (What a Good One Looks Like) | By providing models of work at different standards, pupils learn what good looks like. Pupils can use the models to compare the work of their peers or themselves to identify similarities, and note differences to help them develop their learning in the future.Key details should be highlighted and the characteristics of work at each level should be made clear.Pupil feedback should focus on these objective points. | **History**- Following a series of lessons, pupils complete a piece of extended writing about the Black Death. - Pupils work in pairs and swap their work. - They are then provided with a WAGOLL that explains each of the following ideas, and demonstrates how they link together:- The **real causes** of the Black Death - The **causes that were believed** at the time - The **symptoms** of the Black Death - **Steps** people took to **avoid** catching it - The impact of the Black Death.- Pupils then compare and contrast their peers' work and provide feedback on specific aspects they have included and note points that were not covered, explaining or linking as improvement points. |\n| Use success criteria                                                | Pupils need to understand the requirements of the piece of work in order to be able to assess it.These could be provided by the teacher or – in the case of external assessment materials – adapted from the accompanying guidance to be appropriate for pupils.It is also possible to do this with the class and work together to generate shared success criteria.                                                           | **PE**- Pupils have previous experience of discus. The teacher asks pupils what needs to be done to ensure a discus is thrown effectively. - The teacher writes those points up as success criteria. - Pupils then work in groups of three, taking it in turns to throw the discus. - Each time one pupil does the activity, another pupil provides encouragement about what has been done well against the criteria, and one provides advice on how they can improve. - They then switch around so they all have a go at throwing the discus, offering praise and constructive feedback.                                                                                                                 |\n| Create ‘how to’ guides                                              | These are produced to explain how ideas/skills/processes related to a concept can be applied to different situations irrespective of the context. Pupils can use these themselves during self-assessment to identify actions they need to take if they are having difficulties.                                                                                                                                                | **Maths**- Pupils are working on questions related to 2D projectiles and identify that they are having difficulties. - They are provided with a ‘How to Guide’, which they use to check the process they have undertaken to answer the question. - By checking their working against the ‘How to Guide’ they should be able to spot what they are doing correctly and where they may have gone wrong. They can then write a note to themselves about what they need to ensure they do with future questions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nThere is an opportunity to try some of these activities out in your practice through the next activity.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nReferences\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\nHattie, J., &amp; Timperley, H.

For example:\n\n- If you are using subject-specific vocabulary, are you sure that the individual pupil receiving the feedback has a secure understanding of the vocabulary? If not, use the term and paraphrase/use an example to illustrate. For example,_ “Can you re-do questions 1, 2 and 3 to show you have understood what a prime number is? Remember, a prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1.”_\n- Feedback should be kind, specific and helpful. Have a look at your recent written feedback – is it kind? Is it specific? Is it helpful?\n\n### **Use model work to scaffold self-assessment**\n\nDeveloping pupils’ self-assessment skills can help them become more self-regulated and effective learners.\n\nFor a lesson you have coming up, think about an activity for which you could provide an example which does and does not meet the assessment criteria. You could use work from previous pupils or develop your own. You should highlight the important features (strengths or weaknesses).\n\nLooking at different responses can support pupils to understand what the approaches are that they can take to the task. It is very important that there are success criteria attached to the model so that pupils are able to judge it (with your support).\n\nYou could also do this activity in ‘real time’ using a visualiser, using it as a way to model your thinking as you work.\n\n### **Strengthen peer-assessment strategies**\n\nFor a lesson you have coming up, plan in a peer-assessment activity. Write a set of success criteria that the pupils will use to mark each other’s work.\n\nIn the lesson, mark one piece of work together as a class using the success criteria to model its use.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2>In your notepad - reflect on your practice...</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Which idea(s) for practice did you try?\n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What did you do?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened?</span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <b>\n      <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do next?</span>\n    </b>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n", nil, "c5345de3-20cf-40b2-b286-e6874a6cdbc8"],

A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs. Ultimately, creating and implementing routines in line with your school ethos saves time – and this means that pupils can spend more time focusing on what matters most: their learning.\n\nIn addition, research shows that routines are important for developing pupils' emotional self-regulation - the ability to control their emotions. It is important to develop this because if pupils can control their emotional response, they are better able to concentrate and learn in the classroom, which affects success in school and future lives.\n\nPupils become more able to regulate emotions, such as boredom or frustration, by relying on classroom rules and routines that help them to redirect their attention and minimise stress (Ursache, Blair & Raver, 2012). Therefore, it is important that you invest time in establishing and reinforcing routines to create an effective learning environment.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your current classroom practice and consider the following questions.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What routines do you currently have in place?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How effective are these routines?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Do all your pupils understand and follow these routines?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Are there any tasks or transitions your pupils often make during lessons\n      that would benefit from a more effective routine?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nYou now have 15 minutes to explore one of the routines below that you think would\nbenefit your teaching practice the most:\n<ul>\n  <li>‘Greeting Pupils at the Door’ and ‘Settling Task’</li>\n  <li>‘Transitioning to and from the Carpet’</li>\n  <li>‘Getting Pupils’ Attention’</li>\n  <li>‘Exit Routine’</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Greeting pupils at the door\n\nFrom the moment pupils arrive at your classroom door to the time you begin teaching, there is an opportunity to clearly set expectations and build relationships with pupils in your classroom.\n\nOne way to do this is to greet pupils at the door as they arrive. By meeting your pupils at the door as they enter your classroom, you can build relationships with your pupils, positively reinforce behavioural expectations and create a warm environment before the lesson even begins. By being welcoming, friendly, and setting up a predictable start to the lesson, you will begin to develop a trusting relationship with your pupils.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What makes it successful?</h3>\nExactly how you set up this routine may vary depending on the age of your pupils\nor your school’s policies, but here are some good steps you can take to make it successful:\n\n<strong>\n  Step 1: Stand at or around the door or entrance to the classroom. \n</strong>\n\nThis will enable you to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Monitor pupils’ moods and behaviours as they enter the classroom</li>\n  <li>See both inside the classroom and out onto the corridor or playground</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  Step 2: Positively interact with pupils as they come into the class to help\n  build trust and respect.\n</strong>\n\nThis could be:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Greeting pupils by saying, “Good Morning”, to make your pupils feel welcome\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Asking a relationship-building question like, “How did the football match\n    go?”\n  </li>\n  <li>Simply giving a non-verbal positive interaction like a warm smile</li>\n  <li>\n    Providing positive reinforcement to pupils who are meeting your\n    expectations, for example, “Thank you Mohammed for remembering to put your\n    homework in the box”\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  Step 3: If necessary, provide corrective statements to individual pupils or\n  the entire class to reinforce your expectations.\n</strong>\n\nFor example, you might:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Remind children of the behaviour you want to see in a respectful way, for\n    example, “Remember, we should have our shirts tucked so we’re looking smart”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Use a positive frame such as, “I’m looking forward to seeing you concentrate\n    really hard today”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Avoid negative comments like, “I don’t want you getting distracted again\n    like you did last lesson”. This is a new lesson for you and your pupils, so\n    start with a clean slate\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nIf you also greet parents at the door, for example in Early Years or KS1, this is a great opportunity to build relationships with them too. Sharing a quick comment about how well their child did yesterday at a task or activity, or the progress they are making in a subject, will support you to build positive relationships with the families of your pupils. This in turn can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.\n\n## Settling task\n\nAnother routine you may wish to think about adopting at the start of the school year is introducing a settling task.\n\nA settling task is a short task that pupils can complete the beginning of each lesson without any direct instruction from you. This type of task ensures pupils are focused on learning from the moment they enter your classroom, helping to create an effective learning environment.\n\nBy providing a settling task, you reduce the opportunities for low-level disruption such as talking or loitering. It also has the added bonus of affording you time to greet the pupils at the door, knowing everyone has a task to be getting on with while you do this.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What makes this successful?</h3>\nHere are some ways you can make a settling task successful:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>No direct instruction required</strong> – pupils should be able to\n    see the activity and complete it immediately without asking for help from\n    you or their peers. For younger pupils who can’t read directions or\n    instructions, it might be helpful to model the task the day before or use a\n    task they are already familiar with so when they enter, they can start the\n    task without requiring too much instruction.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Observable</strong> – if you are in KS2 or above, the settling task\n    works best if it involves some writing to make it more rigorous and engaging\n    – and so you can see they’re completing it.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>5 minutes or less</strong> – this is a short task to begin the\n    lesson or the day so it shouldn’t take any longer than 5 minutes to\n    complete.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Review or preview</strong> – the task should be based on a review of\n    learning from a previous lesson or a preview of the lesson that is about to\n    begin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Feedback</strong> – briefly review and feedback on the answers –\n    ideally taking no more than 5 minutes. This may mean prioritising which\n    parts of the activity to review with the whole class that will be highest\n    leverage for your pupils.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Greeting pupils at the door and settling task in action</h3>\nChoose the video that’s most suitable for you.

This is one of the best questions I think of behaviour management because one of the mistakes that I think lots of teachers make is they very frequently assume that children know how to behave in the way that they want them to behave. This is expecting children to be telepathic in ways which they are clearly not. A lot of children come from backgrounds and circumstances where they have not been exposed to lots of social capital, where they haven’t been shown how to take their turn or say please and thank you and so on. Or where they haven’t been exposed to lots of cultural capital, so they haven’t been taken to lots of museums and exposed to art and poetry and science and different places. They may not have come from circumstances where they have been read to a lot or expected to read in turn or count or add up, which means their literacy and their numeracy, the gateway skills to almost everything else in education, are further behind than lots of their other, more advantaged peers. Or worse, these children might have come from toxic environments where they’ve been taught to have bad habits. Habits, which to them aren’t misbehaviour or bad habits, which to them are just how to survive in the environment in which they have been brought up. For example, a child brought up in a large family with inattentive parents, you know, for whatever reason, may find themselves having to shout out or demand attention in order to get the esteem that they seek. Now that child might then bring that into the classroom and repeat that type of behaviour and to them it’s not misbehaviour, to them it’s the habit of how they operate and how they achieve esteem and value and status in a social environment.\n\nSo, that’s one type of child, and another type of child might have been exposed to loads of social capital and cultural capital and literacy and numeracy and so on. Now those children, and good for them – I am very happy that they have received it – might come into school with very different attitudes, expectations, values and beliefs about what education is for and how to behave in an educational environment. The basic point is this: knowing how to behave in a classroom isn’t something children are born with. It’s not written on their brains from the womb. They have to be taught it. They have to learn it and the child who might behave very well in your class, you might say ‘oh what a great child’, when in actual fact, while that may be true, what it also means is that child has been taught to be like that. And children who have been less advantaged have frequently not been taught to be like that as much as their more advantaged peers. Often this correlates to social economic circumstances, but not always. There is plenty of disadvantage in more middle-class families as well.\n\nSo what this means is, is that one of the best things we can do to try to close the disadvantage gap and to create an equitable classroom is to help children know how to behave, which means teaching routines and norms of the classroom as if it were a curriculum itself – teaching behaviour as a curriculum as explicitly and as consciously and coherently as we were to teach literacy or numeracy to the children. Which means not assuming they know how to behave, but first of all assessing how they already behave and what their habits are and then helping them and supporting them by teaching them the routines and habits that will help them to flourish in the classroom, rather than assuming they’ll work it out as they go along. We wouldn’t teach a foreign language like that. We wouldn’t teach numeracy like that. We wouldn’t expect the least able to work out for themselves the most difficult and hardest of lessons, so why should we do this with behaviour? Which means the teacher that genuinely cares about the children and genuinely cares about the wellbeing of the classroom will teach routines as a scaffold or a skeleton or a climbing frame upon which children can hang their behaviour. They need something towards which they can cleave.\n\nThere’s a well-known phenomenon called the curse of expertise, which simply put is this: when you’re very good at something, it’s very easy to overestimate how good other people are who are less good at it. For instance, if you have a PhD in mathematics, you often struggle to remember why some people find it hard to do basic numeracy – adding up, times tables and so on. And that’s because you’ve internalised the harder lessons of mathematics so ably and so well that the basics of it seem so easy. This is the curse of expertise and it’s exactly the same with behaviour. I’ll wager that most teachers and most adults working in education are what I would call ‘expert behavers’. They know exactly how to be patient, wait their turn, focus on texts and so on and a lot of children have not acquired these skills, habits or aptitudes yet. So be as explicit as you can with the routines:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Teach it sequentially;</li>\n  <li>Teach it clearly;</li>\n  <li>Demonstrate by example;</li>\n  <li>Correct common misconceptions; and</li>\n  <li>\n    Re-teach the parts that you think need to be re-taught, including, if\n    necessary, getting them to do it all over again so they don’t just think\n    about what they should be doing, but they demonstrate what they should be\n    doing.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nAnd that’s how you would teach any subject or topic and that’s how we should teach\nbehaviour – by focusing on routines. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n## How to teach effective routines\n\nTime is one of the most important resources you have as a teacher and so it’s important you do what you can to conserve it. Routines can help with this by enabling pupils to complete a task in the quickest, simplest way that requires you to give only a few brief instructions. The following suggestions will support you when planning and teaching your routines.\n\n1. **Be clear on what you want pupils to do**\n   When creating any routine, it is important that you are clear on what you want pupils to do. It is therefore useful if you plan your instructions in advance and ensure that they are:\n\n   - **Specific and observable** – they make the behaviours pupils are expected to exhibit explicit. This also makes it easy to observe whether pupils are doing them or not. For example, saying, “Pencils down and eyes to me” is specific and observable whereas saying, “Pay attention” is vague and abstract.\n   - **Sequential** – they are given in the order that you want pupils to follow them. For example, “Put your pens down, close your books, and eyes on me”.\n   - **Manageable** – use fewer words to make the instruction easier for pupils to process and remember. You can replace words with numbers or gestures to make them even quicker to deliver.\n\n2. **Teach and model your routine in small steps**\n\n   - Teaching a routine in small steps helps to make it manageable and memorable for pupils. When teaching each step, make your behavioural expectations explicit by modelling the step as you describe it. This helps to build pupils’ mental model of the routine and makes it more likely they will achieve success.\n\n3. **Practise your routine at the beginning of the school year until pupils meet your expectations**\n\n   - Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and feedback, increases the chances of them being successful when completing the routine. Frame guidance and feedback positively to motivate pupils to do better next time.\n\nNote that while pupils may master routines after lots of practise at the start of the year, over time you may notice some routines slipping a little. Demonstrate the high expectations you have of your pupils by positively reinforcing your routines and practising them again if necessary. This is the key to maintaining high quality, efficient routines.\n\n## Planning your routine\n\nDuring your next mentor meeting, classroom routines will be observed. Take some time to consider which routines you could establish or improve to enhance learning time in your classroom. Some routines you may wish to consider improving or establishing are listed below in order of highest leverage for pupil learning:\n\n- Greeting pupils at the door and settling task\n- Getting pupils’ attention\n- Transitioning to and from the carpet\n- Exit routine\n\nYou may wish to discuss which one would be highest leverage for you to establish or improve with your mentor. Once you have decided upon a routine, plan how you will teach it in detail and script what you will say. It is helpful to remember to:\n\n- Be clear on what you want pupils to do\n\n- Ensure your instructions are:\n\n  - Specific and observable\n  - Sequential\n  - Manageable\n\n- Plan to teach and model your routine in small steps\n\n- Plan to practise your routine\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nClick here for an example of a script on transitioning pupils from carpets to tables\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  (When pupils are sat on the carpet) “Today we are going to learn how to come\n  to the carpet and go to our tables quickly and quietly.

Therefore, an extrinsically motivated pupil is likely to persist at a challenging task because they want to receive a reward such as a house point, sticker, or praise, or they want to avoid punishment, like a detention or extra homework.\n\n### Intrinsic factors\n\nIntrinsic factors are internal motivators which relate to an individual’s identity and values. As a teacher, you are a key role model, who can influence the attitudes, values and, consequently, behaviours of your pupils. For example, you might emphasise the value of persevering in the face of adversity because in order to improve at something, you must practise areas that you find challenging. Therefore, an intrinsically motivated pupil is likely to persist at a challenging task because they know you need to practise to improve as a result of the values you have been promoting.\n\nAs teachers, our long-term aim is to help our pupils move from needing extrinsic motivation to being intrinsically motivated to work and learn. Both types of motivation will be further explored throughout the programme.\n\nTo begin with, you will explore how to motivate pupils using one type of extrinsic factor: praise.\n\n## Praise\n\nAs a teacher, we can demonstrate our consistently high expectations by acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising the progress pupils are making. This can help to communicate shared values that improve both the classroom and school culture.\n\nWithin the classroom, we can use praise to positively reinforce expectations by recognising pupils’ hard work and effort, sharing and celebrate their work or behaviour, and indirectly preventing low-level disruption.\n\nOutside of the classroom, pupil praise can be a positive way to engage parents and carers in their child’s education by proactively highlighting their efforts and successes.\n\nWhether used within or outside of the classroom, praise can be incredibly motivating for pupils.\n\n## The difference between acknowledgement and praise\n\nAcknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made is a great way to extrinsically motivate pupils. Research also suggests that praise can help to build pupils’ intrinsic motivation too (Henderlong & Lepper, 2002).\n\nSometimes it can be tempting to praise pupils for every correct decision they make in the classroom – from entering quietly to picking up their pens to completing a task you set them. However, overusing praise can make it seem disingenuous to pupils, thereby causing it to lose power and effect.\n\nTo avoid overuse, it can be helpful to keep in mind the difference between acknowledgement and praise.\n\nAcknowledgement is when you recognise or thank a pupil for meeting your expectations. You may use acknowledgement when a pupil follows your instructions or carries out the routines you have set to the standard that you expect. For example, “Thanks Suzy for lining up silently”, or, “I can see 80% of us are ready to start”.\n\nThis is different from praising a pupil for following your expectations – for example, “Well done to Suzy for lining up silently – that’s fantastic”. It’s not a good idea to praise in this way, because it sends out an implicit message that you are in some way impressed that Suzy has met your expectations and didn’t expect her to.\n\nIt’s best to reserve praise and words like ‘fantastic’, ‘brilliant’ and ‘great’ to emphasise pupil effort and progress being made. For example, when a pupil has worked hard in class and made good progress, you might say, “Mohammed has used a fronted adverbial and included the right punctuation – fantastic work Mohammed!”.\n\n## Precise praise\n\nWhen giving praise, you should aim to be specific so that pupils know what they did well. If you don’t inform them of how they demonstrated effort and determination or highlight the progress they have made, then they won’t know what to repeat in future. Therefore, praise should be precise.\n\nHere are some examples of using precise praise:\n\n**Praising independence**\n“Great effort. You used the resources to complete that question without asking for help.\n\n**Praising one-to-one correspondence in counting**\n“Well done – you counted each object once this time.”\n\n**Praising passing a ball correctly in rugby**\n“That’s much better. You passed backwards every time – brilliant work.”\n\n### Precise praise in action\n\nWatch the following video of a teacher using precise praise.\n\nAs you watch, notice how the teacher uses both acknowledgement (to highlight when their expectations have been met) and precise praise (to highlight pupil effort or progress).\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/fOhpOCVrYbQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nPrecise praise – Primary – Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Precise praise – Primary [AD]](https://youtu.be/hhKtDCB-he8)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nIn your next mentor session, your mentor will observe you using precise praise and\nacknowledgement. To help you prepare, reflect on your current teaching practice and\nconsider:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How do you currently acknowledge or praise pupils?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How could you improve this to make it more effective and meaningful for\n      pupils?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n### Engaging parents and carers\n\nEngaging parents or carers in their child's education by sharing successes or achievements with them is another way to extrinsically motivate pupils.\n\nIt can also help to build relationships with carers and families which can further improve pupil's motivation, behaviour and academic success.\n\nThere are many ways of doing this and often schools have their own policies on engaging with parents and carers, so speak with your mentor to explore the approaches you could take.\n\n## Building trust and respect\n\nCreating a calm and respectful classroom environment is a bedrock on which you can build positive relationships with your pupils.\n\nResearch shows that teachers developing trusting relationships with pupils is critical for pupils’ enjoyment of school and for their academic progress. For example, [a 2015 PISA study](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/do-teacher-student-relations-affect-students-well-being-at-school_5js391zxjjf1-en;jsessionid=Tle2wVAsHg1cYXJtlp08_K89.ip-10-240-5-189) found that teacher-pupil relations are strongly associated with performance in mathematics as well as pupils’ happiness and sense of belonging at school.\n\nBuilding effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood. Listen to Bea Stevenson talk here about the role that respect and empathy play in this process and consider the following questions:\n\n- Why is your own self-awareness important?\n- How are feelings linked to behaviour?\n- How can you help pupils to self-regulate their emotions and consequently, their behaviour?\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLbePLTQNXI&feature=youtu.be)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nEmpathy-based classrooms – Bea Stevenson at Family Links\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It's a grey Wednesday morning in November. You have left the house in a hurry,\n  forgetting your keys, and snapped at your mum on the phone on the way in to\n  work. You arrive at school later than you had wanted to, with less time to\n  prepare for the day ahead than you had hoped for. In a short time, your class\n  will be arriving. A class of young people that, if you are honest with\n  yourself, you have not yet been able to build the relationships with that you\n  know are so important. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  So how can you, with everything you are managing in your own life, create a\n  classroom climate that builds trust and respect and that supports all pupils\n  to thrive? \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Firstly, we will think about YOU. What you are dealing with in your own life\n  and how you manage the feelings associated with the ups and downs - your{\" \"}\n</span>\n<b>self-awareness</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, we will consider how </span>\n<b>feelings drive behaviours</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  and how our ability to respond empathically to those around us will support\n  you, as teacher, to build responsive relationships with pupils.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirdly, we will explore how </span>\n<b>high expectations</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  can be maintained through a finely tuned balance of{\" \"}\n</span>\n<b>empathy with clear boundaries.</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  So let’s return to that grizzly Wednesday morning. It’s so important to check\n  in with your own emotional state on a regular basis: where would you be, and\n  place yourself, in terms of your emotions at that point in the day?\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We come to our first point – that </span>\n<b>your self-awareness is key</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  . Recognising your own emotions – whether it’s anger, excitement, frustration\n  or something else – and accepting that you can both be aware of the emotion\n  whilst also being able to ‘park it’, to return to it later, is a key part of\n  being the strong role model that young people need in their lives. As\n  professionals we need to find ways to be aware of, but put to one side, our\n  own emotions - so that we can enable and support young people and build a\n  culture of trust and respect.  \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  To do this, you can create times in the day to ‘check in’ with how you are\n  feeling, for example, whilst walking down the corridor, listening to music, or\n  having a cup of tea with a colleague.  If you can create this space – just a\n  few moments – then you provide yourself with time to understand your own\n  feelings and emotions. This is important because as the orchestrator of the\n  classroom climate, in Haim Ginott’s words, it’s your daily mood that makes the\n  weather. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This leads to our second point that these feelings you are checking in with on\n  a regular basis are driving behaviours – both yours and those of your pupils.\n  Behaviour is often a way of communicating feelings; for example, a child who\n  is shouting out may be feeling overwhelmed and therefore finding it difficult\n  to manage his or her frustration, or a child who shouted at another pupil\n  during play time may have been feeling jealous and angry because they felt\n  left out. It is important that we recognise and accept all feelings, whilst\n  also setting fair, clear boundaries about behaviour. Discussing your emotions\n  and the emotions of pupils is helpful in these circumstances as it helps to\n  expand pupils’ feelings vocabulary. Once they begin to recognise their\n  feelings, you can support pupils to find other tools to deal with the\n  situations they find difficult. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  One way we can encourage pupils to respect and support one another is with a\n  class or group agreement that you can then return to on a regular basis.\n  Including young people early on in identifying how they want to FEEL in class,\n  and in relation to others around them, helps them to think about how they best\n  learn. They may come up with words such as ‘safe’, ‘happy’, ‘energised’,\n  ‘listened to’ and ‘valued’. Then think about the behaviours that are and\n  aren’t helpful for the class to feel these ways. This conversation encourages\n  ownership and a sense of agency for all young people – it means they are\n  invested in the classroom being a place THEY want to be and to learn. It also\n  gives the important and ongoing message that you as teacher are listening to\n  them, that it matters how they are feeling and what they need. This is\n  important because building effective relationships is easier when pupils are\n  aware that their feelings are considered and understood. You can return to\n  this agreement on a daily basis – both as a proactive way to encourage the\n  behaviour you want to see and also as a reminder to young people when they\n  aren’t displaying the behaviour that is helpful to them or others. Remind them\n  gently ‘do you remember we said we all wanted to feel safe’, 'I wonder if this\n  is helping others feel safe, or listened to?', 'What do we need to do to help\n  everyone feel this way?’ This will support their own ability to recognise what\n  they need in order to learn, through an understanding of their own feelings\n  and drivers of their behaviour and therefore support them to self-regulate\n  their emotions in the long term. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The final way to create a culture of respect and mutual trust is to maintain\n  high expectations of pupils through a finely tuned balance of empathy with\n  fair, clear boundaries.\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Empathy, unlike sympathy, is the ability to think about how another person\n  might be feeling and to see a situation from their point of view. So we can\n  tentatively suggest what might be going on for a child when they are throwing,\n  or pushing, or shouting, or of course the less disruptive behaviours such as\n  being withdrawn. It is important you maintain your expectations about\n  appropriate behaviours but attempt to discover the drive for these behaviours\n  in a respectful way such as ‘I’m wondering if you are feeling….’, ‘you\n  seem…..’ . Our instinct sometimes is to try and solve things for the young\n  people we work with rather than help them to deal with the potentially\n  complicated feelings. It is important to understand that the way we hold high\n  expectations of behaviour is not through methods that might shame or humiliate\n  the children in our classes but in how we help pupils to change their\n  behaviour.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  So, how do you create a culture of mutual trust and respect that supports all\n  pupils to thrive? First, make sure you are thinking about YOUR self-awareness\n  – as the role model, the young people in your class are learning about\n  relationships in their every interaction with you and with the interactions\n  they see you having with others. Second, remember that behaviour can be driven\n  by feelings: support young people to recognise and name these feelings, as\n  well as find appropriate ways to manage them. Third, it is absolutely possible\n  to have high expectations of yourself and young people – setting clear\n  boundaries whilst also responding with empathy and understanding. Finally and\n  most important, an empathy-based classroom pivots on you, the teacher, being\n  able to be a responsive adult for young people, and in order to be that person\n  it is crucial that you look after yourself.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your teaching practice and consider the following questions.

When behaviour incidents occur, no matter how small or large, it’s important that you respond consistently in the least intrusive ways which align with your school’s behaviour policy or approach.\n\nTo support you to do this, in this session you will explore:\n\n- What is low-level disruption?\n- Using early and least intrusive interventions as an initial response\n\n## What is low-level disruption?\n\nWhen teaching a carefully planned and well-resourced lesson, you may expect pupils to remain focused and engaged throughout - and some pupils will. However, some pupils may require prompts to keep them focused on their learning.\n\nSometimes, a pupil’s attention may drift unintentionally, and they may begin to exhibit low-level disruption. On other occasions, pupils may deliberately exhibit such behaviours to avoid engaging with work.\n\nWhatever the reason is for a disruption, it’s important to address it as early as possible to prevent it from escalating and impacting further on pupils’ learning.\n\nLow-level disruption can be anything that disrupts the flow of your lesson. Some examples include pen tapping, chatting, calling out, entering late, chewing gum, playing with resources and swinging on chairs.\n\nIn isolation, low-level disruption can seem harmless. But when it occurs frequently, it can become increasingly difficult to manage and this inevitably impacts on pupils’ learning.\n\nIn session 1, we looked at how to prevent low-level behaviour by creating and reinforcing routines, and in session 2 by positively reinforcing behaviour with acknowledgment and praise. Here we will look at how to address low-level disruption once it has occurred.\n\nIn response to low-level disruption, one approach we can take is to use the Least Invasive Intervention (Lemov, 2015). Lemov argues that by minimising the ‘drama’ you can correct off-task pupils without interrupting the learning. In contrast, if you confront pupils too publicly, you may escalate a situation unnecessarily, and make a pupil feel embarrassed or shamed. This makes the situation worse for both you and the pupil – and is more likely to derail the learning of this pupil and others.\n\nLemov identifies six subtle techniques that a teacher can use to quickly address low-level disruption, which you will explore throughout this session. These techniques are listed below in order, with the least intrusive method at the top:\n\n1. Non-verbal Intervention\n2. Positive Group Correction\n3. Anonymous Individual Correction\n4. Private Individual Correction\n5. Lightning-quick Public Correction\n6. Private Individual Praise\n\nIn the classroom, you may choose to address low-level disruption by employing the least invasive technique first (non-verbal intervention) and work your way down the techniques if the previous one doesn’t work. However, there may be some occasions where you choose the method you feel is most appropriate to the context and the behaviour being exhibited at the time.\n\n## Non-verbal Intervention\n\n'Non-verbal Intervention’ is when you use gestures or your proximity to a pupil to mitigate low-level disruption in a non-invasive way.\n\nThe advantage of this technique is that the teaching does not stop while the disruption is being addressed, so the flow of the lesson is not interrupted in any way. It is also a respectful way to refocus pupils because it gives them an opportunity to self-regulate their behaviour without being shamed or embarrassed in front of their peers.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example 1 – Using proximity</h3>\nIf you notice a pupil no longer following the text during whole class reading, you\nmight walk closer to where they are sitting whilst continuing to read, to prompt\nthem to follow the text. Here, you’re using your own proximity to the pupil to redirect\ntheir attention, without needing to say any words. Other pupils are unlikely to even\nbe aware that you are intervening. $I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example 2 - Using gestures</h3>\nIf a pupil is fiddling with their pen or whiteboard during a phonics lesson, you\nmight use a downward hand gesture to signal to the child to put their pen down whilst\nthe rest of the pupils continue to read sounds that you point to on the board. $I\n\nThese are great ways to refocus off-task pupils without stopping teaching. However, such interventions can become invasive if not performed correctly.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Non-example</h3>A pupil is fiddling with their pen or whiteboard during a phonics\nlesson, so you use a downward hand gesture to signal to the child to put their pen\ndown and <em>wait</em>, looking at them intently with a frown on your face until\nthey do. $I\n\nIn the non-example above, the teacher stops teaching. Therefore, the rest of the class has stopped learning and are now watching the non-verbal communication between the teacher and the off-task pupil. This may embarrass the pupil and causes lost learning time. Always aim to use non-verbal interventions discreetly whilst continuing to teach your lesson.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>‘Non-verbal Intervention’ in action</h3>\nWatch a video of a teacher using non-verbal interventions.\n\nConsider the impact this has on the individual pupils and on the class’s learning.\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nH1J1NKeYmo\"\n  width=\"560\"\n  height=\"314\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\n></iframe>\nNon-verbal Intervention – Primary – Reach Academy\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n</span>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iLSO67NAnA8\">\n  <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n    Non-verbal Intervention – Primary – Reach Academy [AD]\n  </span>\n</a>\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5Go9F0pYbaA\"\n  width=\"560\"\n  height=\"314\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\n></iframe>\nNon-verbal Intervention – Secondary – Tilly Browne, Reach Academy\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oGavydEX150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Non-verbal Intervention – Secondary [AD]\n  </a>\n</span>\n$CTA\n\n**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**\n\nIf the pupil still hasn’t refocused after you have used a non-verbal intervention, then you may need to employ the next technique: positive group correction.\n\n## Positive Group Correction\n\n‘Positive Group Correction’ is a quick verbal reminder addressed to the whole class.\n\n**Why address the whole group rather than individuals?**\n\nThere are two reasons for this:\n\n1. Saying the names of pupils who are not complying with your instructions may cause embarrassment or escalate the behaviour to a confrontation that further disrupts the lesson.\n2. In addressing the whole class, you may prompt others to check their behaviour who may also be off task - but you hadn’t noticed.\n\nThis intervention is best framed in a positive way – by describing the solution rather than the problem. For example, ‘Everybody should have their pens down and eyes to me’. The correction needs to be short and direct so as not to disrupt the flow of the lesson.\n\nIf you want to increase accountability of individual pupils, you could non-verbally indicate to a specific pupil whilst still speaking to the whole class.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>‘Positive Group Correction’ in action</h3>\nWatch a video of a teacher using positive group correction.\n\nConsider the impact this has on the pupils and the classroom environment.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UOx5sU3ACcY\nPositive group correction – Primary – Reach Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EIe2_Y5-Lr8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Positive group correction – Primary [AD]\n  </a>\n</span>\n$CTA\n\n**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**\n\nIf the pupil still hasn’t refocused after using positive group correction, then you may need to employ the next technique: Anonymous Individual Correction.\n\n## Anonymous Individual Correction\n\n‘Anonymous Individual Correction’ is similar to the positive group correction in that it is anonymous and solution focused. However, it additionally informs the class that there are some pupils who are non-compliant. For example, “Eyes on me. I am still waiting for two more pupils”.\n\nAnonymity reduces the level of disruption caused, as it prevents pupils from being tempted to turn and face the individual being addressed. It addresses the behaviour in a respectful way, helping to maintain an environment of mutual trust and respect.\n\nThis technique also gives pupils more ownership over their behaviour as they identify for themselves that they are one of the pupils who isn’t ready. This has the added benefit of encouraging independence and self-regulation.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>‘Anonymous Individual Correction’ in action</h3>\nWatch the video of a teacher using anonymous individual correction with their pupils.\n\nConsider the impact this has on the class's learning and on the pupils’ sense of autonomy and independence.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mlMhO4sQ9Jk\nAnonymous individual correction – Primary – Francesca Reid at Reach Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PZvu7VrV6xM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Anonymous individual correction – Primary [AD]\n  </a>\n</span>\n$CTA\n\n**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**\n\nIf the pupil still hasn’t refocused after using anonymous individual correction, then you may need to employ the next technique: Private Individual Correction.\n\n## Private Individual Correction\n\n‘Private Individual Correction’ is when you address a pupil’s behaviour discreetly whilst the rest of the class are working independently or with peers.\n\n**What happens if the behaviour occurs during whole-class teaching?**\n\nIf you notice a pupil is off task whilst you are addressing the whole class, you might give the class a quick task to complete.\n\nFor example: “Turn to your partner and tell them what you know about _insert topic being covered_”.\n\nWhilst they are doing this, you can approach the pupil, crouch down next to them, and quietly address the behaviour.\n\nFor example: “Sunita, it’s important that you understand this method of subtraction. It will help you work independently later. Make sure your eyes are on the board, thank you.”\n\n**Why is this effective?**\n\n- It describes the solution (“Eyes on the board”)\n- It emphasises the purpose to the learner (“It will help you work independently”)\n- It is done respectfully and privately, rather than in front of the rest of the class\n\nThese features help to create a culture of mutual trust and respect which supports the development of effective relationships.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>‘Private Individual Correction’ in action</h3>\nWatch the video of a teacher using private individual correction with their pupils.\n\nConsider the impact this has on the class's learning and on the pupils’ sense of autonomy and independence.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3CimgVGzlGM\nPrivate individual correction – Primary – Sophie Emms at Reach Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9TwU1oanji8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Private individual correction – Primary\n  </a>\n</span>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EWaqkrNG02c\nPrivate individual correction – Secondary – Reach Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\n  <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n    If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this\n    version:{\" \"}\n  </span>\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1gzCYPk-DTM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n      Private individual correction – Secondary\n    </span>\n  </a>\n</span>\n$CTA\n\n**What happens if the behaviour is repeated?**\n\nThis will depend on the behaviour policy of your school and the rules you set in your classroom but if you have asked a pupil to correct their behaviour twice already and you have to return to them again, you may need to issue a consequence.\n\nFor example: “Sunita, you need to watch and listen so you can learn. I am going to have to (insert consequence e.g. move your name down, move you to yellow, ask you to come and practise at break). Now please show me your best. Thank you”.\n\nConsequences are something you will explore in more detail in the next session.\n\n**What happens if I don’t have time to privately correct a pupil’s behaviour?**\n\nIf you don’t have time to address an individual pupil’s behaviour privately, you might instead adopt the next technique: lightning-quick public correction.\n\n## Lightning-quick Public Correction\n\nSometimes it will not be possible to correct a pupil’s behaviour privately. In such instances, it is important that the pupil under scrutiny is in the spotlight for as short amount of time as possible. This avoids overly embarrassing the pupil or disrupting the focus and attention of other pupils.\n\nThis type of public correction should be made as quickly as possible: preferably lightning-quick!\n\nHere’s how to do this:\n\n1. Name the pupil\n2. Name the behaviour you want to see (rather than stating what they are doing wrong)\n3. Bring the class focus back to the positive behaviour that’s happening in the classroom\n4. Reinforce the pupil’s now on-task behaviour (if it occurs)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example 1 - Singing a counting song in Early Years:</h3>\n“Javed, I need to hear you. Brilliant singing at the back… Much better Javed.” $I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example 2 - Independent task in Primary or Secondary</h3>\n“Arfaan, pencil moving. Brilliant concentration Toufika and Samantha... That’s much\nbetter Arfaan.” $I\n\nIt is of course important that you only acknowledge the now on-task behaviour if the pupil is exhibiting it. Don’t be tempted to praise an individual if they have not shown compliance.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>‘Lightning-quick public correction’ in action</h3>\nWatch a video of a teacher using lightning-quick public correction with their pupils.\n\nConsider the impact this has on the pupils' and the class’s learning.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BOslWwKKhHw\nLightning-quick public correction – Early Years – Ark John Keats Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/L3NgvmoT91w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Lightning-quick public correction – Early Years [AD]\n  </a>\n</span>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/C0aMQ89IeUY\nLightning-quick Public Correction – Secondary – Phil Fowkes at Reach Academy\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\n  If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version:{\" \"}\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K41mfw03CyE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    Lightning-quick Public Correction – Secondary [AD]\n  </a>\n</span>\n$CTA\n\nWhat happens if the behaviour is repeated?\n\nAs before, this will depend on the behaviour policy of your school and the rules you have set in your classroom.

I am going to have to (insert consequence e.g. move your name down, move you to yellow, ask you to come and practise at break). Now please show me your best. Thank you”.\n\n## Private Individual Precise Praise\n\nOne final technique that you may use, not so much to address low-level disruption directly but rather to encourage optimal behaviour and learning, is private individual precise praise.\n\n‘Private Individual Precise Praise’ is when you go over to an individual pupil during independent work and whisper some positive praise for the good work or behaviour they have exhibited.\n\n$I\n\n<strong>Example</strong>\n\nYou walk over to a pupil, crouch down near them and whisper, “Tom, the explanation you gave to the class just now was outstanding – well done.”\n$I\n\nThis is a strategy that can help you to build effective and trusting relationships with pupils by balancing correction of behaviour or work with praise.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\n\nIn your next mentor session, your mentor will observe you using positive and least invasive behaviour management strategies.

However, if a pupil keeps exhibiting disruptive behaviours, or if their behaviour is more challenging or severe, it is likely you will need to address this by issuing a consequence or sanction.\n\nTo support you to do this, in this session you will explore:\n\n- Why are consequences or sanctions important?\n\n- How to issue consequences or sanctions effectively\n\n  - Consistent\n  - Depersonalised\n  - Deferred\n\n- Identifying the appropriate consequences or sanctions\n\n## Why are consequences or sanctions important?\n\nA consequence or sanction is used to reinforce the behavioural expectations that you set in your classroom and communicate shared values that improve both classroom and school culture. Consequences should be used to educate pupils about which behaviours are and are not appropriate and should help them to learn that if they choose to be disruptive, they choose to face the consequences.\n\nDifferent schools may approach consequences in different ways and often have a behaviour policy which outlines this. For example, some might have a policy that states teachers should give two warnings to a pupil before issuing a consequence.\n\nIf there isn’t a system in place in your school, you will need to decide your own system and be consistent with it to ensure you create a predictable environment for pupils where the behavioural expectations are clear.\n\nBecause schools vary in their approach to behaviour management, we will focus here on how to issue consequences effectively rather than what type of consequence to issue.\n\n## How to issue consequences effectively\n\nWhen issuing consequences, it is important to ensure disruption to learning is minimised and you try to maintain pupil-teacher relationships. Some ways you could do this is to ensure your consequences are:\n\n- Consistent\n- Depersonalised\n- Deferred\n\nIn your next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to discuss your school’s behaviour policy and how you can effectively employ consequences in line with it.\n\n## Consistent\n\nIt is important that you are consistent with the consequences you issue. For example, if you have decided that pupils talking when you are talking is something you won’t tolerate and will correct (and rightly so), then you must pick up on this behaviour _every_ time and be consistent in how you address it. By being consistent, you help to make your pupils’ learning environment predictable and secure, which benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.\n\n### Issuing consequences consistently\n\nAs soon as you ignore or respond differently to a negative behaviour, pupils will be unclear about your expectations. For example, if a negative behaviour is ignored, pupils are more likely to exhibit this behaviour thereafter because they have learnt they can get away with it or that you deem it acceptable because you have allowed it to happen.\n\n### Delivering consequences consistently\n\nIssuing consequences consistently is important but it is equally important that you follow through with them. For example, if you have issued a consequence to a pupil such as missing their break time, then it’s vital that they do. If they don’t (maybe because you forget or because they don’t show up) they will learn that the consequences that you issue are actually empty threats and are meaningless.\n\nAny consequence you issue must be delivered consistently.\n\n$CTA\n\nListen to Tom Bennett discuss this in more detail and make notes on the following questions:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why is consistency important?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Why is it important to be consistent with the whole school community?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How can you ensure you demonstrate consistency in your behavioural\n      expectations?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/eXlJz11L-hI)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nThe importance of clarity and consistency – Tom Bennett\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nNothing you do in a classroom will bed in with the students behaviourally unless it's incredibly consistent. If you want something to be a norm, if you want a given behaviour to be the norm, if you want a routine to be normal then it must be done, demonstrated and explained consistently. That this is much harder than many teachers I think suspect, it's something much harder than many schools suspect and it's where many teachers and schools get it wrong.\n\nThey can sometimes get it right by demonstrating what these behavioural expectations should be and perhaps at the start of the relationship they're quite clear and explicit about what they should be doing, but then that consistency starts to fall off and if you show children that your norms and routines are inconsistent, they don't become norms. In fact, the norm becomes inconsistency which is why, although it sounds dreary and dull, the best thing we can do as teachers and educators is to make sure that once we've established a rule or norm, we try to be as consistent as possible. This is the glue that holds everything together. Without that glue the bricks fall to the ground. So this means a few things.\n\nFirst of all, it means being entirely consistent. When you say something matters you have to demonstrate constantly that it matters yourself. Secondly, you have to demonstrate this across time, and again this is perhaps the harder part because your own standards might start to shift or erode as time goes on and you might not even notice it, which is why it's incredibly important that you are super clear about your standards not just with the children but with yourself. It's not enough just to think, 'I want them to behave well'. Behave well is far too vague. You want to clarify for the children and for yourself what good behaviour looks like in a queue, waiting to go into the classroom, moving from the carpet to the table, getting books from the shelves or whatever circumstances you think they might struggle with in terms of the behaviour. So that clarity needs to be there not just for the children but also for yourself.\n\nThere is also a greater sense of consistency which is that it's terribly important as a member of staff to try and be as consistent as you possibly can with the whole school community and the whole school body. This helps to reinforce one another's barriers, expectations and norms. If for instance there’s a whole school norm about not drinking in a lesson or not having a mobile phone in a lesson or something like that, it's terribly important that you adhere to that and uphold it and be as consistent throughout your group as you are with yourself, otherwise you undermine everyone else's attempt to uphold the norm. It might be useful for you in that instant, but it robs the authority of the people next door to you and they might be struggling with their behaviour, perhaps even more than yourself.\n\nA good example of this would be, for example, you're trying to tell children that you don't want them to shout out and let's say you want them to put their hands up whenever they want to speak to you. Now that's fine, that's a perfectly acceptable norm to have. What you might do then is ask a question like ‘when is the Battle of Hastings?’ A child might just shout out the answer and the mistake for the teacher would be then to say 'no you mustn't shout out but yes, that's the answer', and then move on as if nothing has happened because that child has learned to reinforce that behaviour. That child has learned that in order to get attention he should shout out and he doesn't need to put his hand up. The children who have their hands up have learnt ‘what’s the point in putting my hand up?’ and the children that never speak have been pushed further and further away from participating in the lesson. So ironically, although the teacher may have thought they were being nice, what they've done is they’ve reinforced a negative norm and encouraged children to shout out. But what you should do to make sure that norm is more consistent is by, once the students shouts out the answer to the Battle of Hastings, then say 'I'm waiting for a hand up' and then take an answer from somebody else who has their hand up, emphasize that that was good because they had their hand up and then say to the child 'I need to speak to you in a few minutes about your behaviour.'\n\nIn other words, actions must have consequence and norms must be upheld otherwise it's dramatically easy to be inconsistent and to reinforce that inconsistency. So, consistency is the glue that keeps all of this together.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n### Keeping track of pupils and their consequences\n\nKeeping track of pupils and their consequences can be challenging. One way to support you to do this is by using a notebook to record names of pupils you need to follow-up with to ensure you don’t forget.\n\nYour school may also have a central system to support with tracking behaviour and consequences, something you may wish to ask your mentor about in your next meeting.\n\n## Depersonalised\n\nAs a teacher, you are a key role model, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of your pupils. Therefore, when issuing consequences, it’s important you focus on the behaviour itself - and not on the pupil. This has several benefits:\n\n- It is least intrusive as it refocuses the learning quickly by naming the negative behaviour and therefore encouraging the pupil to correct this\n- It helps to maintain positive relationships with your pupils and establish a supportive and inclusive learning environment because you are labelling the behaviour as negative rather than the pupil themselves\n- It gives the opportunity to model courteous behaviour that you would expect from pupils by demonstrating how to speak to individuals in a respectful way\n\n### How can you ensure your consequences are depersonalised?\n\nThe language you use will support you to do this as demonstrated in the non-example and example below.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Non-example</h3>\n“You just can’t listen, can you? Move your card down.”\n\nThis labels the pupil, not their behaviour. This may have a negative impact on the pupil’s self-esteem and may make them more likely to think they can’t achieve and thus ‘give-up’. It may also be damaging to your relationship with this pupil as it doesn’t help to create a respectful and trusting learning environment and doesn’t take the pupil’s feelings into consideration.\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n“James, you’re talking, I’m moving your name down. Look this way like I know you\ncan. Thanks.”\n\nThis labels the negative behaviour (talking) not the pupil, and gives them a solution for how to get back on track. It is also much more positive. Below are the key features that make this example successful:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Names the pupil so there is no uncertainty around who the teacher is\n    addressing (<em>James</em>)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Identifies the negative behaviour so the pupil knows why they are receiving\n    a consequence (<em>you’re talking</em>)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    States the consequence <em>(I’m moving your name down)</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Ends positively and assumes respectful cooperation{\" \"}\n    <em>(Look this way like I know you can. Thanks)</em>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n## Deferred\n\nThe defining feature of a deferred consequence is that it places ownership on the pupil by giving them the option to follow your instructions or face a more severe consequence later.\n\nUnlike the quick correction you might use to correct a behaviour first time round, a deferred consequence is more serious and will take place later – for example at break time, lunch time, or after school.\n\nThis type of consequence should be used when a pupil continues to disrupt a lesson or to disobey your instructions and the consequence given should align with the behavioural policy or class sanctions you have set.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nIf you have already asked a pupil to put their phone away two times and they still\nhaven’t, you would give them the <em>choice</em> to do this or face the consequences\nof not doing this. To issue this deferred consequence, you might say:\n\n<em data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">\n  “If you choose not to put the phone away, I’ll have to ask you to stay back\n  after class.”\n</em>\n$I\n\nBy giving pupils the choice before issuing that more severe consequence, you give them the opportunity to correct their behaviour. This supports their emotional and behavioural self-regulation, which can impact upon their success at school and beyond.\n\nIf a pupil does not make the right choice, it is important that you issue the deferred consequence and follow-up on it. By doing this, you are teaching pupils that you will be consistent in rigorously maintaining your behavioural expectations.\n\n## Issuing a consequence in action\n\n$CTA\nWatch a video of a teacher giving a pupil a consequence in your phase. Consider the following questions and record your response:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How is the consequence delivered?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Consistent</strong>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Depersonalised</strong>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Deferred</strong>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What impact does this have on the pupil’s and their peers’ learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/Ihjfhfkr0uo)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nIssuing a consequence – Primary – Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Issuing a consequence – Primary [AD]](https://youtu.be/bb0vn3Kdlzk)\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/6CaEyn3_HoY)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nIssuing a consequence – Secondary – Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Issuing a consequence – Secondary [AD]](https://youtu.be/RoVb4n9IRig)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink of a time when you have issued a consequence to a pupil and consider the following\nquestions. Record your reflection in your notepad.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How did you issue the consequence?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What impact did this have on the pupil’s and their peers’ learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Thinking about what helps to make delivering consequences effective\n      (consistent, depersonalised, deferred), what might you do differently next\n      time and why?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\nIn your next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to share your reflections and discuss how you can deliver effective consequences in line with your school’s behaviour policy.\n\n## Identifying the appropriate consequences or sanctions\n\nKnowing the appropriate consequences or sanctions to give for a certain behaviour can be tricky as behaviour is context specific and arises for a multitude of reasons, meaning no two situations are the same.\n\nIt is important to develop an understanding of how to deal with challenging situations that may occur in your classroom so you can respond quickly to behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. Such situations may include: pupil refusal, swearing, racial abuse, or showing signs of aggression or physical abuse. If such incidents do arise, you need to know how to respond appropriately.\n\nAs with low-level disruption, it’s important to be consistent with the approach you take to sanctioning for these more challenging behaviours.\n\nYour school will likely have their own policy or approach to addressing these types of behaviours. This will often include when to remove a pupil from your classroom, when to escalate an incident to a more senior member of staff, or when external services may need to be involved.\n\nIf you aren’t yet sure what these policies are, discuss your school behaviour policy with your mentor in your next meeting.\n\n## Case studies\n\nIn your next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to discuss what you have learnt this session and how to respond to persistent and challenging behaviour in your school context.\n\nTo prepare for this, choose one case study below and decide how you would address the pupil’s behaviour in line with your school’s approach. Make notes ready to discuss with your mentor in your next meeting.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nEarly Years challenging behaviour case study\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<h4>\n  <strong>Pupil background</strong>\n</h4>\nPupil A is in Reception.

His dad engages with school\nwhen he can. He works shifts so sometimes is unavailable to speak to at the beginning\nor end of the day. When this happens, his sister collects his children from school.\nHis dad is concerned about his son's behaviour and regularly asks for ways to support\nhis son both at school and at home.\n<h4>\n  <strong>The incident</strong>\n</h4>\nPupil A occasionally demonstrates aggressive behaviour. In the past, he has thrown\nitems in the classroom such as pencils or building blocks but has never harmed another\npupil until this incident.

He joined the school halfway through year 4 and comes from\na challenging background. His parents are separated and have been for the duration\nof his time at our school. Both parents hold very different views on behaviour and\nas a result have different expectations of their child which can confuse him as it\nmuddles the boundaries we try to set at school. His mother is approachable and willing\nto try and support him in school but often makes excuses for his lack of engagement\nor disruptive behaviour, often blaming the lesson for not being engaging or challenging\nenough for him, whereas their father is very strict and holds extremely high expectations\nof him. He sees his father every other weekend and I always notice a difference in\nhis behaviour after spending time with his father. I have no contact with his father\nas his mother is his primary carer. He has very low self-esteem and resilience.\n<h4>\n  <strong>The incident</strong>\n</h4>\nThe pupil regularly demonstrates challenging behaviour across a range of settings\nthroughout the day. On one occasion, I was teaching long division, explaining the\nsteps and asking pupils to attempt further questions on their whiteboards. Whilst\nI was teaching, I could see he was not tracking me or following my explanation.

He and his twin brother (Student B) have officially\nattended the school since arriving in year 8 following their parents’ divorce, but\nboth have low attendance, with the student in question on the verge of persistent\nnon-attendance in year 10. The boys live with their mother, though Student B has\nspent periods living with their father. Mother is personally supportive, but struggles\nto influence the behaviour of the boys, often accepting their misbehaviour or non-attendance\nin order to maintain her own relationship with them and avoid the risk of them returning\nto their father. Father refuses to interact with school. Both boys are socially active,\nwith reports of smoking, drinking and anti-social behaviour outside of school. Both\nstudents are theoretically bright, but have limited motivation and concentration,\ncontent gaps due to absence, and a tendency to react aggressively or ‘walk out’ when\nchallenged.\n<h4>\n  <strong>The incident</strong>\n</h4>\nStudent A and Student B are both in the same class for their English lessons, and\nregularly distract each other when present. Student B’s attendance has been noticeably\nhigher than his brother’s. In the run-up to a set of mock exams, both students, following\nsome pressure on and support from both parents, were going through a phase of regular\nattendance. While revising poetry, some of which Student A had not studied due to\nabsence, Student A was distracted by Student B. When reprimanded, Student B focused\non the work in question. Student A continued to attempt to catch his brother’s attention.\nHe refused to engage with the tasks given, rejected support offered, and eventually\nthrew his pen across the table, asserted that he couldn’t do it and couldn’t see\nthe point, added “Fuck this”, and walked out of the lesson. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nIt’s important that you don’t feel alone in dealing with challenging behaviour - you have a right to be supported by your school to deal with it. If you do encounter incidents that you are unsure how to deal with or don’t feel confident to address, you should seek support from your mentor, a member of your senior leadership team and possibly your SENCo. Managing behaviour is a whole school responsibility so you shouldn’t feel as though you have to act alone.\n\n## Repairing and rebuilding relationships\n\nSome consequences or sanctions can have a negative impact upon your relationship with your pupils depending on how they have been issued or what the circumstances were. On these occasions, it is important to find time to follow these interactions up with a restorative conversation. This enables you to discuss the incident, reinforce your expectations and demonstrate that you have considered and understood your pupils’ feelings.\n\n$CTA\n\nListen to Tom Bennett talking about the importance of repairing relationships and holding restorative conversations to improve pupils’ behaviour. Whilst watching the video, consider the following questions and make notes in your notepad:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Why is it important to hold restorative conversations – what are the three\n      key messages you can convey during these?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>When is the best time to hold restorative conversations?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/ktEzi6NO30k)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nHow do you repair and build relationships? – Tom Bennett\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nOk, so how do you repair relationships? What do you do when things go wrong either with an individual pupil or with an entire class (hopefully not)? There's lots of things that can be done. In fact, there's lots of things that must be done and one of the first things that must be thought of is ‘what are the consequences for these actions?’, ‘What needs to happen?’ So for example if you have got a whole school consequence system, if you have a C1 or C2 or students are meant to lose golden time or students are meant to have their parents called at home or have a postcard home or whatever the consequence of the action is, it's terribly important that you follow that to the letter unless there's a reasonable exception to be made. The reason why that's important is because you're not just upholding the norm for that child but also for the entire class. Students need to know that their actions matter and if that means a mild sanctioned, then so be it. If you take the sanction away, and you can't run classes entirely on sanction, but if you take the sanction away, then you lose the deterrent effect which might be implicit in that sanction. So, try to be as consistent as possible even if you don't like or feel like giving the sanctions. In fact particularly even then because you don't want to come across as unfair to the children by only letting children off because they normally behave well or perhaps there’s some kind of invisible bias - you like them more than others, and that would be a dreadful norm to try to communicate to the children.\n\nSo that's the sanction or reward element but perhaps more importantly is how do you then repair that relationship? Because the objective of every response from a teacher should be improving the child's behaviour. And a lot of that is going to be through conversational or pastoral methods. Which is to say that whenever a student achieves any kind of consequence for their action of whatever type, there must be some kind of restorative process where the aspiration is to reintegrate the child into the classroom, but not willy-nilly, but rather with a greater understanding of:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>where they went wrong</li>\n  <li>what need to do to improve</li>\n  <li>\n    and why they're still valued and why they're still wanted as a member of a\n    classroom.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nWe can reprimand students, for example, for misbehaving and do so in a positive way.\nWe can say things like ‘I expect better of you and I know you can do better’ and\n‘is there a reason why you weren't behaving?’ and we might start to unpick and unpack\nperhaps some other, deeper reasons why children are misbehaving. They may be being\nbullied or going through, parents going through divorces at home and so on. That's\nwhat we need to try to find out, particularly if there are patterns of misbehaviour.\nBut in the conversation where we reintegrate the child into the classroom, we need\nto establish those three things:\n<ul>\n  <li>What went wrong?</li>\n  <li>What you can do better.</li>\n  <li>\n    And you are still valued, and I want you in the classroom, but I want you to\n    be better.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nIf the child can acknowledge and understand those three things, there is a chance\nthat behaviour will improve. What mustn't happen is that the child is simply reintroduced\ninto the classroom environment because being removed from the classroom environment,\nbeing asked to wait outside in the corridor, being given some kind of sanction is\nnot in itself restorative - it does not cure or improve people. What it tends to\ndo is give the class a respite, which is important but isn't going to be focused\non restoring the behaviour of the student. So, give them ways forward.\n\nAnd the time to do this, the time to have this conversation - it depends. If the student’s misbehaviour is small, if the reasons for it are fairly mundane like they were just mucking around, then the response and the restorative conversation and the attempt to repair needs to be as quickly as possible: the next break time, the next lunch time, at the end of the day and so on. Perhaps even in the class if it’s a very small incident. But if the student’s behaviour is extreme or they become very upset or you've become very upset, then the time to have that conversation is not immediately. Because when people are agitated or upset or adrenaline's rushing to the system and when the blood is hot, those are not the best times to have rational, intelligent conversations. Those are the times to think to yourself, ‘we need a bit of breathing space and we need to separate ourselves and allow ourselves to calm down’. You cannot control a fire, you can certainly contain it and let it burn itself out and even the most agitated student will calm down and even the most agitated teacher will calm down. So, be aware of you and yourself in this process and ask yourself ‘is this the right time for me to have this sort of conversation?’ But crucially the conversation must be had and if it's a small incident, it can be a short conversation. If it’s a bigger one, it needs to be a long, more extended conversation, possibly using other parties from the school, possibly using people from the student's home as other parties to try to sustain and support the reintegration.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h2\n  class=\"rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write heading…\"\n>\n  Reflection\n</h2>\nThink about an occasion when you think a consequence or sanction might have impaired\nyour relationship with a pupil.

Therefore, you should help pupils journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically.\n\nTo support you to do this, this session will explore:\n\n- What determines intrinsic motivation?\n\n- How can you boost motivation?\n\n  - Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success\n  - Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes\n  - Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals\n\n## What determines intrinsic motivation?\n\nPupils’ intrinsic motivation is complex as it is influenced by a multitude of factors such as:\n\n- Their prior experiences, for example, within a given subject, or with a given teacher\n- Their perception of success and failure – whether they view failure as a part of learning and whether they believe their capabilities are fixed or under their control\n\nAs a result, a pupil’s level of motivation can change depending on the circumstance and context of the situation they are in. For example, a pupil may be very motivated to work hard in their maths lesson but not in their PE lesson. Or maybe a pupil used to be motivated in their maths lessons in year 2, but in year 3 they are not.\n\nAs motivation is so malleable, you can influence it.\n\n### How can you boost motivation?\n\nMotivation is determined by pupils’ experiences of certain situations or environments. Therefore, to boost pupils’ motivation, it is more effective to change their experiences and environment rather than to try and reason with them. You can do this by:\n\n- Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success\n- Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes\n- Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals\n\n## Providing opportunities for meaningful success\n\nAs a teacher, you can influence your pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils can experience meaningful success.\n\nSuccess drives motivation. You are much more likely to want to engage in activity if you have previously experienced success with it as opposed to failure. Therefore, you can motivate pupils by helping them to experience success when learning. However, there is a careful balance to strike when doing this. If a problem or activity is too tricky or too easy, pupils are unlikely to get the same sense of achievement (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, it is important that you strive to set your pupils challenging but achievable tasks. However, making tasks achievable can be tricky. The curriculum consists of a great deal of challenging content that pupils might find difficult to master, but it isn’t always possible or beneficial to pupils to overly simplify this content. Instead, to support pupils to achieve meaningful success, Willingham (2009) suggests you can help to make the _thinking_ easier.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can do this and many of these will be explored throughout this programme. In this session, you will explore how to help pupils achieve meaningful success by ensuring they have enough thinking time to respond to questions or discussions and are provided with the opportunity to gather and collate their thoughts before sharing them with the class. One way you can do this is through a technique called ‘Everybody Writes’ or by using talk partners.\n\n## 'Everybody Writes' or talk partners\n\n‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners is a great way to support pupils to be successful in their answers. This is because it provides pupils with time to think about their answer before sharing it with the whole class.\n\nWhen asking pupils a challenging question or asking them to engage in a classroom discussion, tell them to write down their answer or thoughts before asking them to share this with the class. For younger pupils, asking them to spend some time thinking about their answer and then using talk partners works in the same way and has the same benefits for a class discussion.\n\nThis has three main benefits:\n\n1. This will ensure that every pupil has a prepared answer to your question providing all pupils the opportunity to achieve success.\n2. It increases the time that pupils have to process and think about the question and therefore will increase the depth of the answer.\n3. You can circulate the classroom as pupils are writing their answers or discussing it with their partner and select a pupil that has a good answer to share and/or pick up on any misconceptions as part of the discussion.\n\nTo increase pupils' success, you may want to display or model using a writing or speaking frame as this will help to increase the focus and rigour of pupils’ written ideas or dialogue.\n\n$CTA\nWatch a video of a teacher using ‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners and consider the following questions:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">\n      How did the teacher support all pupils to be successful?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What impact did ‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners have on the quality of\n      the answers?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/56JL9UMdbq4)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTalk partners – Early Years – Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Talk partners – Early Years [AD]](https://youtu.be/wK4JdJkTjzU)\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/KJzNaJhNmyg)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTalk partners - Primary - Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Talk partners - Primary [AD]](https://youtu.be/qjzKUbQXXoA)\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/sbtvC-MWa_g)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTalk partners – Secondary – Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Talk partners – Secondary [AD]](https://youtu.be/L2ulgc_4FFM)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your teaching practice. Consider the following questions and record your\nreflection in your notepad:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How do you support pupils to feel successful in the classroom?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Do you give all pupils the opportunity to experience meaningful success\n      and how could you improve this?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Create a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes\n\nJust as feelings of success can lead to motivation, feelings of failure can lead to demotivation. This could be problematic because when learning new concepts, there are likely to be times when pupils misunderstand something and make errors, in fact this is often a critical part of learning. If pupils don’t recognise this as an important part of learning, and instead see this as failure, then it is likely to demotivate them from further engagement.\n\nCreating a positive learning environment where pupils feel safe to make mistakes and recognise this as an important part of learning is likely to increase their motivation to learn.\n\n### How can you create a positive environment where pupils feel safe to make mistakes?\n\nThere are a number of ways you can do this:\n\n- Tell pupils that mistakes and misconceptions are a part of learning\n- Praise pupils for their effort and progress rather than whether they are correct or not\n- Where pupils have made public mistakes or errors, thank them for their answer and for allowing you use their answer as a learning point for the class\n\nCreating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes will take time, particularly where pupils' academic confidence is low. Where this is the case, it is important to regularly reflect on the language you are using with pupils and that you ensure you are planning regular opportunities for them to be meaningfully successful.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Creating a positive learning environment in action</h3>\nWatch the video most suitable for your phase.

Record\nyour reflection in your notepad:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How comfortable do you think your pupils are at making mistakes?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How can you make them feel more comfortable?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals\n\nPeople are intrinsically motivated when they have autonomy over what they do and are given meaningful choices about what they engage with. However, in the classroom setting, it is difficult to present pupils with choice over what they learn or how. This is because they are novices, and are therefore perhaps not best placed to make those decisions.\n\nAs a result, in order to develop buy-in from your pupils, it’s important that you explain to them why they are engaging in certain tasks and activities and help them see how their success in school is related to achieving their long-term goals.\n\nOne way to do this is to show pupils the journey of their learning and how different topics and subjects will build upon each other, throughout the year and their school journey. Some schools use curriculum maps to do this.\n\nAnother way is to ask pupils, ‘Why do you want to be successful?’ and ask them to record this on a piece of paper or a post-it note. This can be used on a display and constantly referred to throughout the term or year.\n\nBy providing pupils with opportunities to articulate their long-term goals and linking this to their success in school, you help to develop their intrinsic motivation to succeed.\n\nOf course, it is also important that you support pupils to achieve these, for example, by helping them to master challenging content which builds towards their long-term goals.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Primary example</h3>\nIf a pupil’s long-term goal is to improve their handwriting, you might support pupils\nto achieve this by providing them with activities that improve their fine motor skills,\nproviding them with opportunities to practise individual letter formations and recognising\nand praising their efforts during writing tasks. Providing practise opportunities\nand recognising success will help to develop intrinsic motivation. $I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Secondary example</h3>\nIf a pupil’s long-term goal is to go to university to study being a doctor, they\nwill most likely need to study biology, chemistry and maths or physics at A-level.\nTherefore, they will need a good foundational understanding of those subjects at\nGCSE level. If you teach those subjects, you can support pupils to achieve their\nlong-term goal by carefully planning how you teach challenging content to support\npupils to master it. There are many factors which make up effective teaching and\nthese will be explored in subsequent modules throughout the programme. $I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your classroom practice and consider the following questions:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How do you generate pupil buy-in and is this effective?

This is because all pupils have a vast range of experiences and beliefs about their own capabilities.

Behaviour and attitude on the playground were often highlighted as an area of concern and learning time was often used to resolve issues after these unstructured times.\n\nIn September, I really wanted to engage this pupil and ensure he knew that this year was a fresh start and a new opportunity to shine. Therefore, I really focused on positive choices and praised this pupil at every opportunity and ensured I shared these with his parents. I speak to all parents regularly. I make a point of contacting them or arranging meetings to discuss positive behaviour so that we can mutually support one another and so the parents see school as a positive place to be too. Pupil A’s parents informed me that they really appreciated this, and it boosted their child’s self-esteem.\n\nAt the start of each year, I create a Class Charter with the class and discuss what rights and responsibilities we all have. All the children sign this, and the expectations are made clear from the start. I refer to this throughout the year to remind pupils of our shared values when they demonstrate negative learning behaviours. This has been a great way to support Pupil A to adapt his behaviour as it helps him to self-regulate his emotions and, consequently, his actions.\n\nDue to the learning needs of the whole class this year, I have really tried to promote a love of reading. To do this, I talk to the children about authors they like and books they would like to see in our classroom. I also carefully select class novels that I know will engage the children and create great opportunities for cross-curricular learning. For example, Pupil A is very passionate about football, so I selected ‘Tom Palmer’s Defenders\" as our first class novel and linked this to our Vikings unit. Pupil A was a very reluctant reader in September; however, as a result of the actions I have taken, I now get regular feedback from his parents to say that he is reading regularly and even goes to bed early to read his books. To develop this further, I also set up a bed time reading box (with a new book, hot chocolate and marshmallows, and a new bookmark) which I send home each week to the children who are trying hard to read at home and in school. Pupil A was keen to get this award and was one of the first to take it home.\n\nHis positive engagement with reading has impacted upon his attitudes towards writing too. In the transition meeting with his previous teacher, I was told that Pupil A was a very reluctant writer in year 4, but I’ve certainly not seen this in year 5. I think he is much more motivated to engage with tasks he finds challenging because I provide him with opportunities to experience success and celebrate this with the class.\n\nI have provided lots of opportunities for Pupil A throughout the year to really shine, be more responsible and achieve meaningful success. He’s enjoyed being a Playground Pal on the KS1 playground and this has significantly improved his own playground choices. I recognised that Pupil A had a real interest in our recent science unit, Earth and Space, so I selected him to work with our EYFS children to share his knowledge as they were also learning about Space. During and after his visit, he was praised by the staff and received great feedback about his excellent subject knowledge and kind, caring demeanour.\n\nPupil A is now exceeding his end of year targets across all areas of the curriculum. This is a result of mutual respect, holding high expectations and creating many opportunities for Pupil A to achieve meaningful success\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nA Year 9-11 Spanish Case Study\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIn year 9, Pupil A was chatty, frequently distracted and was often heard saying that she ‘couldn’t do Spanish’. During that year, she also had an extended period of absence. On her return she was withdrawn, worried and very unconfident with Spanish. Now in year 11, she enjoys Spanish and is working at a strong grade 3 with elements of a 4.\n\nI believe that she is very much capable of achieving a 4 in the summer exams. I have implemented many strategies to increase her motivation in the subject and this has brought about a change in her attitude. One of the key strategies was utilising parent's evening. Towards the end of year 9 I had an in-depth chat with her parents and herself during parent's evening. We discussed what she was finding difficult in Spanish and what she felt she needed to improve. Whilst this is nothing out of the ordinary for a standard parent's evening, I really felt this was the first turning point for her. Her mum was very supportive, which was a real boost for her. We talked for a long time and I felt that she really enjoyed having her own voice and understanding that her thoughts and feelings were being considered.\n\nAt parent’s evening, Pupil A expressed a concern that she was behind with vocabulary. I was able to give her a department booklet which aims to catch up new students to GCSE with the key vocabulary. Whilst this booklet wasn’t specifically designed for her, I decided to make use of the available resources in the school. She responded really well to receiving this resource and completed the booklet at home. I think she liked the security and feelings of success associated with knowing a lot of the words whilst still having a chance to check she was secure with them.\n\nAs luck would have it the department also had a few spare revision guides. I took the decision to lend the revision guides to her at the start of year 10, again, to make use of available resources within the school, as I knew that she was a girl that needed pushing to the 4. Again, I really feel that these very small but significant gestures of help intrinsically motivated her. I think they showed that we were all on her side and believed in her ability to make great progress and succeed.\n\nDuring year 10, we did a few pieces of work where pupils had to create their own ‘versions’ of resources. For example, pupils created their own personalised verb sheets. She enjoyed the creative side of this activity. She has since taken it upon herself to create her own ‘version’ of other resources such as a writing revision sheet and a speaking strategies PowerPoint. I think it is fantastic that she chooses to work so independently and have always praised her for this great level of engagement. This praise further motivates her to engage and succeed.\n\nTo help ensure success, I provide her with small chunks of information to learn at a time. For example, she has been learning speaking questions in small sections rather than all at once. She has responded very well to learning in small bursts.\n\nThroughout all of this, I really feel that building a personal relationship with Pupil A has been vital. At the beginning of year 9, it sometimes felt that all I ever did was tell her off. This was detrimental to our relationship and wasn’t motivating her to change so I quickly realised I needed to switch the focus of conversation to be about how I could help her to succeed. Once we were on a more positive footing towards the end of year 9, I could see that she was actually sometimes stressed in Spanish. The interventions I have put in place above as well as interventions in lessons, such as giving her targeted support or praise, have all helped to ease this stress, provide her with feelings of success and motivate her to engage in the subject both in school and at home.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs noted in the previous session, it’s important that you don’t feel alone in dealing with challenging behaviour - you have a right to be supported by your school to deal with it. If you do encounter incidents that you are unsure how to deal with or don’t feel confident to address, you should seek support from your mentor, a member of your senior leadership team and possibly your SENDCo. Managing behaviour is a whole school responsibility so you shouldn’t feel as though you have to act alone.\n\n## Application to practice\n\nIn your next mentor session, you will be observed using strategies that help to build pupils' motivation such as:\n\n- Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success\n- Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes\n- Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals\n\nYou will also have the opportunity to discuss how to build the intrinsic motivation of any disengaged learners you may teach.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### High expectations\n\n1.1 Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.\n\n1.2 Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.\n\n1.3 Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.\n\n_1a.

Research has shown that when teachers have high expectations for their pupils, their outcomes are better (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018; Hattie, 2008; Rubie Davis et al, 2014). Therefore, it is important that you hold high expectations for _all_ your pupils.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your classroom practice and consider the following questions. Record\nyour reflection in your notepad:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Do you have high behavioural and academic expectations for <em>all</em>{\" \"}\n      your pupils or do your behavioural and academic expectations differ for\n      different pupils?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Why do you think this is and what impact might this be having on your\n      pupils’ progress and outcomes?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Holding high expectations for contributions and engagement\n\nSetting clear expectations helps to communicate to your pupils what you expect of them. Through doing this, you can convey the values of your classroom and school, which can help to improve the learning environment and culture. You should spend some time considering what your behavioural and academic expectations are. It might be useful to discuss these with your mentor to ensure they are fitting and align with your school’s behaviour policy.\n\nWhen considering the level of concentration and contributions that you expect from your pupils, it is helpful to consider the concept of ratio. This can be broken down into two parts:\n\nRatio in the classroom is the ratio between two variables (Lemov, 2015):\n\n1. Participation ratio - how many pupils in the classroom are participating in the task. The ideal here is every pupil.\n2. Think ratio - the level of rigour in the thinking and engagement that you foster in your pupils.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Line chart displaying the relationship between the Think Ratio (how rigorous is the work) and the Participation Ratio (How many are participating) as an upward curve. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/image-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThe goal is to get to point A on the graph where you have both a high participation _and_ high think ratio in your classroom. To do this you must demonstrate high expectations of _all_ your pupils, expecting _everyone_ to concentrate and participate in your lesson. This will maximise learning and progress for all pupils, helping them to achieve, feel success and therefore feel motivated to continue participating.\n\nHolding and rigorously maintaining high expectations is important but knowing how to implement them in the classroom and demonstrate them to your pupils can be challenging.\n\nIn the next part of this session, you will explore some strategies that will help you demonstrate high expectations for engagement and motivate pupils to remain focused, such as:\n\n- Holding high expectations for contributions\n- Using countdowns or timers\n- Making the beginning and end of activities clear\n\n## Holding high expectations for contributions\n\nIt is important that you communicate your belief in the academic potential of _all_ your pupils. To do this, you should set and maintain clear behavioural expectations for concentration and contributions during a lesson.\n\nOne way to do this is by setting the expectation that all pupils should be prepared to contribute during a lesson if asked to do so. This encourages pupils to take responsibility for learning and emphasises the importance of trying, even if a pupil is unsure of their response. It is quite common in this scenario for a pupil not to answer or to say, “I don’t know”.\n\nIf a pupil doesn’t respond or says, “I don’t know”, there are several ways you can support them to answer the question, such as:\n\n- Providing a hint or prompt to support them to contribute\n- Asking another pupil to give a hint to help them to respond\n- Asking another pupil to answer, and then going back to the original pupil to repeat or add to their response\n\nThis helps to build a culture of engagement and inclusion. It also clearly conveys to your pupils that you expect them to remain focused during your lesson so they can be successful in their learning.\n\n### Holding high expectations for contributions in action\n\nWatch one of the videos below to see how teachers hold and demonstrate high expectations for contributions in the classroom:\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/IFzVJSLnWsE)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nHolding high expectations for contributions – Primary\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/aSzOLKBDkSc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nHolding high expectations for contributions – Secondary\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Holding high expectations for contributions – Secondary [AD]](https://youtu.be/AQvDUDAgNrE)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about your classroom practice and consider the following questions.

One way to support you to communicate this to your pupils and help them to stay engaged in activities is to share the duration of time that pupils have to complete certain activities. This has several benefits:\n\n- It supports the pupils to remain focused on learning\n- It can create a sense of achievement when pupils complete a task in the time\n- It supports pupils manage their learning time\n- It supports the pace of the lesson, helping you as a teacher to keep the lesson on track\n\nYou can use a timer for almost all classroom activities whether they are academic or not. Using a timer works best if you:\n\n- State how long pupils have\n- State what pupils are expected to do in this time\n- Visibly share the timer and refer to it. For younger pupils this might be in the form of a sand timer and for older pupils this might be in the form of a countdown clock\n- Provide check points along the way e.g. you should be at question 5 by now\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3\n  id=\"block-2981e58c-972b-47a2-8f21-135bb05d9b45\"\n  class=\"block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable wp-block\"\n  tabindex=\"0\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write heading…\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  data-block=\"2981e58c-972b-47a2-8f21-135bb05d9b45\"\n  data-type=\"core/heading\"\n  data-title=\"Heading\"\n>\n  Using countdowns or timers in action\n</h3>\nWatch one of the videos below to see teachers using a countdown or timers in the\nclassroom and consider the following points.

Record your\nreflection in your notepad:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How do you ensure pupils work purposefully on activities?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Does this promote high expectations and support pupil engagement?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How could you improve this?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Making the beginning and end of activities clear\n\nAnother way to support pupils to stay focused and engaged during lessons is to make the start and end of activities clear. This can help to keep the pace of the lesson and therefore keep pupils alert and focused. Some ways you can do this are:\n\n1. **Clear start**\n   Make sure that all pupils know when to start the task by using a clear cue. Everyone starting tasks at the same time means that it keeps pupils focused and the environment purposeful as pupils don’t drift into starting activities or have a quick chat before they begin. For example, when starting pupils off on a task, you might say, “Three, two one, off you go.”\n2. **Clear finish**\n   Ensuring that all pupils know when the activity has ended and what they should do next means that pupils are not finishing at different times and have a chance to start to be off task. Making it clear when the time is up and what to do to show that they are ready is key to you being able to get the pupils' attention and move on with the lesson. For example, using a timer with a sound to indicate time is up and then giving instructions of what to do such as, “Pencils down, eyes on me.”\n3. **Provide positive reinforcement**\n   Positively reinforcing your expectations helps to ensure all pupils start and finish the task as and when you directed. For example, when starting a task, you might say, “I can see four tables have started, well done.” Equally, when finishing a task, you might say, “Pencils down, eyes on me, thanks front row, I have all of you looking at me.”\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3\n  id=\"block-7139c7dd-ec11-483f-ae48-b4556fa5e11b\"\n  class=\"block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable wp-block\"\n  tabindex=\"0\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write heading…\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  data-block=\"7139c7dd-ec11-483f-ae48-b4556fa5e11b\"\n  data-type=\"core/heading\"\n  data-title=\"Heading\"\n>\n  Making the beginning and end of activities clear in action\n</h3>\nChoose one of the videos below to watch teachers make the beginning and end of activities\nclear.

By holding high\n  expectations, you encourage pupils to work harder, do more and thus achieve\n  more.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It is clear that pupils with high levels of motivation are more likely to step\n  out of their comfort zones and take risks in order to make improvements in\n  their work. Conversely, pupils with low levels of motivation are likely to\n  give up easily, leave work incomplete or refuse to answer questions in lessons\n  because they “do not know”. \n</span>\n<h4>\n  <b>So what impacts pupils' motivation?</b>\n</h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Pupils' levels of motivation can be a product of their own experiences. For\n  example, if a pupil has always struggled with algebra in maths this may then\n  impact their level of motivation when studying algebra as they assume it will\n  be difficult and therefore it becomes more difficult. Pupils can also be\n  influenced by parental views of certain subjects. As a languages teacher I\n  have experienced many occasions where at parent's evenings parents have\n  explained how much they struggled in French, didn’t like speaking out loud and\n  could not understand the grammatical concepts – this has then influenced their\n  child’s motivation and therefore success in languages. \n</span>\n<h4>\n  <b>How can you develop pupils' motivation?</b>\n</h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Building pupil success in lessons is key in developing pupil motivation. There\n  is a balance to be struck between challenging pupils “to think hard”,\n  supporting pupils with scaffolding and modelling, and increasing levels of\n  pupil independence. It is also important for pupils to feel supported in their\n  learning environment so that it becomes accepted that all learners make\n  mistakes. A key assessment for learning strategy for this is to circulate the\n  room during independent practice and where common misconceptions have been\n  identified, stop the class and address the issue there and then to prevent the\n  error from being learnt. When doing so, it is important to thank the pupil for\n  sharing their work and learning with the rest of the class to help maintain a\n  safe and positive learning culture.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  You can also help to create pupil buy-in during lessons to motivate them to\n  engage. One way to do this is to share the learning objectives and make sure\n  they are clearly explained, so that pupils are aware of what they are going to\n  be doing, why they are doing that and how this links to their long-term goals.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### High Expectations\n\n1.1 Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.\n\n1.3 Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.\n\n1.4 Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.\n\n_1a.

But what can teachers do to support pupils to learn effectively?\n\nIn this session you will explore:\n\n- The impact of the working and long-term memory on learning\n- The limitations of the working memory\n\n## A model of the mind\n\nAs teachers, every day you are aiming to teach pupils new concepts, ideas, and strategies that they can use and apply inside and outside of school. For any meaningful learning to have taken place, there must be a lasting change in pupils’ understanding and capabilities.\n\nAn important factor in learning is **memory**. Over the past 25 years, significant breakthroughs have been made in terms of our understanding of how the mind learns, and how we can support the occurrence of _lasting change_. Having a good understanding of the research around memory and learning will enable you to integrate the findings into your practice, and in turn, help pupils to learn new information more quickly.\n\nListen to the module expert Ben Riley, the Executive Director of Deans for Impact, as he explains what we know about how pupils learn best, and the role that memory plays in this process.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/noTvKPxlHbE)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nHow pupils learn – Benjamin Riley\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nHello, I'm Benjamin Riley, the founder and Executive Director of Deans for Impact - an education non-profit organization based in the United States working to ensure that every child is taught by a well-prepared teacher. And part of what we mean by well-prepared is making sure that all teachers have an understanding of how their pupils learn. And so that's what I'm going to be speaking with you about today is how pupils learn. And we're going to be looking at that through the lens of cognitive science. The outline for this short video is as follows. I'm going to give you some good news, then I'm going to give you some bad news. Then I'm going to show you a bit of a model, a visual model to understand the good and bad news. Then I'm going give you a bit more good news and then we're going to end with a quiz, so we don't have much time – let's dive in.\n\nSo, here's the good news. Everything I'm about to talk about when it comes to how students learn is not going to change. As I'm recording this video, we're living in a time of great global uncertainty but what's good is that the processes by which students learn aren't going to change because of the pandemic. They're not going to change because of anything happening with technology. These are the products, the products of millions of years of evolution is what's resulted in how our minds work and so that's a good thing because it means we can actually plan around that. And further, I'm going borrow a phrase from my good friend, a cognitive scientist named Dan Willingham who I'm going to reference repeatedly, who says that ‘children are more alike than different in how they think and learn’. And thank goodness for that. It means that we can sort of understand this cognitive architecture – in other words, how our minds work – and know that that's going to be generally true for the vast majority of students that we work with. Again, barring some cognitive impairment. So that's the good news.\n\nNow here's the bad news. Those millions of years of evolution have produced minds that are actually not built to think, which is counterintuitive, right? I mean obviously all thinking takes place in the mind so what do we mean when we say minds have not evolved to think? Well, let me try to explain and I'm now going to bring in a super fancy model, what Dan Willingham calls ‘just about the simplest model of the mind’:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4412\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"530\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4412\" src=\"https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/12/Model-of-the-mind-updated.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram shows the relationship between working and long-term memory, with information being recalled from long-term to working memory when needed and processed into long-term for storage. Environmental factors also input into working memory. \" width=\"530\" height=\"299\" /> Willingham (2009)[/caption]\n\nAnd here we go: our minds are basically over here (the working memory and long-term memory), they consist in this simple model of our working memory – the place where conscious thought happens, and our long-term memory – the knowledge that we've stored. You might think of this as the hard drive where we've kept all of our things that we've learned in life.\n\nNow all of the active thinking that takes place in our consciousness happens here in our working memory and then, if we're effective in educating, it becomes part of our long-term memory and you can see over here I've labelled something called the environment and I'm not referring to trees with deer running through them, although that could be part of it. This is just everything that's happening outside of our minds. It's literally the world and as you can see, our working memory interacts with the environment and then interacts with long-term memory.\n\nNow the bad news is, as far as we know, there's nothing we can really do about working memory. There is very limited capacity that we have to hold more than a few thoughts at any given time and it's just fixed. But the good news, and here's the bit of good news, is that we can add to our long-term memories as far as we know in virtually limitless capacity. The challenge is that because this (the working memory) is so limited, we don't actually want to think – it's hard, it's effortful. Now of course there's great exceptions to that, I'm not saying that we never want to think, but by and large we're looking for ways around having to think and so the key again in education is to try to get students to think about material that we want them to remember. And you may be thinking this may sound very abstract so let me give you a very salient example:\n\nRight now if you're listening to me and you're understanding what I'm saying, you're doing so because you've learned the English language and so you can actually think about the content of what I'm saying rather than worrying about translating the words that I'm saying. Now for some of you who may have English as a second or third or fourth language, it may be a little bit harder. I might be talking a little bit too fast; I might have used vocabulary words you're less familiar with.\n\nAnd so this is important for teachers to keep in mind: is that all of your students are going to come with different aspects of knowledge, different things in their long-term memory. And the challenge for you is going to be figuring out ‘how do we get them to think about the things that I need them to think about and not overly burden their working memory when I'm not exactly sure what's in their long-term memory.’ It's a challenge and I can't say that there's any easy way to solve it, but that in some ways is the beauty of teaching: is that you are constantly trying to figure that out and do what you can to help your students improve what's here.\n\nSo that was a very hurried introduction to the cognitive science of how we learn and how pupils learn and so now we're going to have a very brief quiz:\n\nEffective teachers can help their pupils improve\n\na) their working memory\nb) their long-term memory\nc) both\nd) neither\n\nHave a think for a second.\n\nThe answer of course is b) effective teachers can help students improve their long-term memory.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Working and long-term memory\n\nAs you have heard from Ben Riley, a useful way to think about memory is as a system, comprised of two components: long-term memory and working memory.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Diagram shows the relationship between working and long-term memory, with information being recalled from long-term to working memory when needed and processed into long-term for storage. Environmental factors also input into working memory. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/12/Model-of-the-mind-updated.jpg $EndURL $Caption Willingham (2009) $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n**Long-term memory** can be considered a store of knowledge that changes and grows as pupils learn. The knowledge remains in the long-term memory until it is needed, when it enters the working memory. For example, if you were asked the question how many legs a spider has, you would remember that the answer is eight. This knowledge has been drawn into your working memory from your long-term memory.\n\n**Working memory** is the site of awareness and thinking, where we hold information that is being actively processed by our mind. The working memory draws upon both the environment and long-term memory to process things. It is very small in capacity and, unlike long-term memory, its capacity cannot be changed.\n\nWithin your working memory might be the things you are noticing from your environment, such as the temperature and light levels, as well as things you are currently thinking about. When teaching, it is important that you reduce distractions that will take the focus of the working memory away from what is being taught. For example, ensuring that there is a purposeful learning environment, free from distracting behaviours, or making sure the content you are teaching is pitched correctly in terms of your learners’ abilities. This will ensure pupils are focusing on the new learning, rather than other potential distractors.\n\nThe working memory also processes information into long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. It is important to note that the working memory has a very small capacity. Pupils with a learning difficulty that affects their working memory may have a smaller capacity still and will require information to be provided in small steps. For all pupils, the limitations of the working memory have fundamental implications for the process of teaching and learning. This is explored in the next section of the module.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Activity</h3>\nHaving heard from Ben Riley and read further around the Willingham model of the mind,\nconsolidate your understanding of this topic by answering the following question:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What is the role of the working and long-term memory in the process of\n      learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nPrepare to share this explanation with your mentor during your next mentor interaction.\n$CTA\n\n## The limitations of the working memory\n\nThe fact that the working memory is limited in its capacity has profound implications for teaching and learning. To experience the limitations of the working memory, try to work out the maths problems below without writing anything down.\n\n1. 2x3\n2. 6x7\n3. 12x15\n4. 183x587\n5. 1983x1874\n\nAs the questions became more complex, it is likely that you did not know the answer and couldn’t therefore retrieve it from your long-term memory. You would have attempted to hold some information in your working memory and manipulate it. As the numbers got larger still, you may well have tried to remember and manipulate more than your working memory could handle. If this was the case, you would have experienced working memory overload and either become frustrated or given up, feeling that it was impossible to complete.\n\nYou may be able to recall times when you noticed that your pupils were experiencing working memory overload, and they put their head down on the desk or became disengaged from a task that they have been working on. If you had been allowed to write down the numbers, or you knew the times tables relating to the questions, the amount of information being processed by your working memory would have been less, meaning that you were having to hold and manipulate less information at the same time.\n\nAs a teacher you are introducing pupils to new information all the time, with the intention that they process, manipulate and transfer this knowledge into their long-term memory. Therefore, understanding the limitations of the working memory is critical. The way you deliver new learning to your pupils has a profound impact on whether they learn it or not.\n\n## Avoid overloading the working memory\n\nLearning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. If you want your pupils to learn and retain new information, you need to avoid overloading the working memory, giving the knowledge a chance of becoming stored in the long-term memory. In this section, we will explore how the capacity of the working memory can be protected by building on pupils’ prior knowledge.\n\n### Considering prior knowledge\n\nAs you have already explored, an effective way to avoid overloading the working memory is to be able to draw on information from your long-term memory. When introducing a new concept or idea, building on prior knowledge that is already stored in the long-term memory can mean that you reduce the risk of overloading the working memory, as the pupil can apply some of their prior knowledge to help them understand the new content. As Ben Riley mentioned in his video, pupils may have different levels of prior knowledge around a topic. As such, trying to build on this can be a challenge for teachers.\n\nWhen you are deciding how to introduce new knowledge, carefully consider the three questions below to help pupils use their prior knowledge to support their understanding:\n\n1. What existing knowledge and vocabulary do pupils need to have in order to be able to access and understand the new idea or concept?\n2. What are the key ideas and concepts that you want your pupils to learn?\n3. How could you link these key ideas and concepts to their prior knowledge?\n\nThe answers to these three questions will provide a starting place for your planning, and an understanding of where to pitch new learning. Listen to Teacher Educator and History teacher Lee Donaghy talk through how he assessed his pupils’ prior knowledge, and how he built on this in an effort to avoid overloading the working memory.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/OToo6B6DVW4)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nBuilding on prior knowledge\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI was preparing to teach the module ‘USA 1945-75’ to my year 10 GCSE history class. We were focusing specifically on the ‘Red Scare’, a period of heightened fear of Communism and its threat to the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and we were working towards answering the enquiry question: ‘How did the international situation make Americans more fearful of communism?’.\n\nIn order to access this topic, I knew my pupils needed to know the international context at the end of World War Two. I was aware that they had studied World War Two in year 9, and so checking their prior knowledge of it, and re-teaching it if necessary, would mean they all had the foundational knowledge needed to help them learn the events, people and concepts that we would cover in this new topic.\n\nI checked this foundational knowledge through a simple assessment task where I asked pupils to list the theatres and combatants in World War Two, as well as recall some of the key dates &lt;show slide 1&gt;. This showed me, almost inevitably, that some pupils had remembered more of this knowledge than others. This meant I had to re-teach this information, by re-capping events firstly in Europe &lt;show slide 2&gt; and then in the Far East &lt;show slide 3&gt; during the war. I then secured this specific knowledge in pupils’ long-term memories through repeated retrieval of the same information in each of that week’s lessons &lt;show slide 4&gt;. You can see that I actually gave pupils most of the sentence, and they only needed to fill out the date. This is because I wanted to really focus their thinking on the dates, as these were the key pieces of information I wanted them to retain.\n\nThe final thing pupils needed before accessing the new content was to understand the concepts of Capitalism and Communism &lt;show slide 5&gt;, and the differences between them, in order to begin to understand why people in the USA may have feared Communism. In my experience, pupils tend to arrive in year 10 with a vague understanding in this area, and often carry some misconceptions, such as Capitalism being synonymous with democracy. In order to bring every pupil to a similar level of understanding, we read about the two systems and then categorised their economic and political features. Again you can see that I have highlighted some of the key points in the text to focus pupil thinking towards the key elements of these concepts. I added questions on the key differences to the retrieval quizzes I used for the remainder of the week, again to secure this specific knowledge in pupils’ long-term memories.\n\nWith all of this foundational knowledge now secure, I felt confident that the burden on their working memories would be reduced when we moved on to encounter new knowledge.\n\nThe new knowledge I wanted pupils to learn was largely dictated by the exam specification &lt;show slide 6&gt;. Pupils needed to understand how events outside of the USA in the half decade or so after World War Two led to an increase in the fear of Communism inside the USA.\n\nHowever, before explaining how I linked this new knowledge to pupils’ prior knowledge, I want to give one very specific example of the precise knowledge that I identified pupils needed. I focused in very specifically on the term ‘Red Scare’ &lt;show slide 7&gt;, as I wanted pupils to have a clear understanding of its meaning. I used a visual image from the period to demonstrate attitudes towards Communism in the USA and explained that ‘Red’ was used as a shorthand for Communism and Communists, before we wrote a working definition of the term ‘Red Scare’ that pupils could refer to throughout this section of content.\n\nI finally turned to teaching pupils about the events outside of the USA that drove increased fear of Communism. &lt;show slide 8&gt; Focusing on the first series of events, the Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe, we returned to what pupils already knew about World War Two in Europe. Pupils recalled that Nazi Germany had been invaded from the West by the USA and Britain and from the East by the Soviet Union &lt;show slide 9&gt;. I was able to build on this knowledge to explain that many of the countries in Eastern Europe through which the Soviets had passed during the invasion of Germany stayed under Soviet control in the immediate post-war years, and that by 1950 many of them had Communist governments which were installed and supported by the Soviet Union &lt;show slide 10&gt;. The general, foundational understanding that pupils had of the USSR’s role in the defeat of Nazi Germany and the geography of the conflict in Europe supported their ability to assimilate the more detailed information about which countries became communist and how this divided Europe between a Capitalist West and Communist East. We were then able to drill down further, looking at specific events in 1948 and 1949, like the Berlin Blockade and Airlift, the partition of Germany and the creation of NATO.\n\n&lt;End slide show, back to talking head&gt;To sum up, I secured the knowledge that pupils had previously learned about World War Two by checking their recall of key facts and dates about the conflict, re-teaching it as necessary and testing it. I also explicitly taught the key features of, and differences between, Capitalism and Communism in order to overturn some potential misconceptions. I then built on this foundational knowledge by clarifying and defining the term ‘Red Scare’, and then introduced new knowledge about Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe with reference to what pupils already knew about World War Two in Europe and how the conflict had ended.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nConsider the following questions\n\n1. **What existing knowledge and vocabulary did the pupils need to have in order to be able to access and understand the new idea or concept?**\n2. **What are the key ideas and concepts that Lee wanted his pupils to learn?**\n3. **How did he link these key ideas and concepts to the pupils’ prior knowledge?**\n\nAs Lee explained, when planning his unit of work, he selected a number of key facts, essential concepts and skills that he wanted to ensure that pupils would be able to commit to their long-term memory. If pupils have a secure number of key components committed to memory, it means they can call upon them to support their thinking as the complexity of the learning increases. Through his planning he was able to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and master these critical components, and he ensured that he focused his pupils’ thinking on these key historical ideas.\n\nWhere prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if the new ideas are introduced too quickly. It is important to ensure that the necessary foundational knowledge is secure, as Lee did, so that critical thinking or problem solving can be developed.\n\nIn the next session we will look at ways to introduce new knowledge to pupils that do not overload the working memory, and thus help to avoid the development of misconceptions.\n\nReflect on your learning from this session by considering how you have introduced new ideas or concepts to your pupils to date.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nConsider a new idea or concept you have taught, which pupils struggled to understand.\n\n<strong>\n  On reflection, what knowledge and/or vocabulary did you assume that they had?\n  How did this impact on their learning?\n</strong>\n\nPrepare to share your reflections with your mentor.\n$CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### How Pupils Learn\n\n2.1 Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.\n\n2.2 Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.\n\n2.3 An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.\n\n2.4 Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.\n\n2.5 Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.\n\n_2a.

In this session you will explore two methods of introducing new knowledge:\n\n- Breaking complex material into smaller steps\n- Combining verbal and graphical representation\n\n## Considering how to introduce new knowledge to pupils\n\nOnce you have considered what pupils need to know in order to access the topic, you can start to consider _how_ to introduce new information to your pupils. The most effective way to introduce new ideas is to break complex material into smaller steps and teach these steps one-by-one. This can be considered at a topic level, whereby the teacher breaks down the different knowledge and skills required, teaches them discretely across the topic or unit, then brings them together once pupils are proficient at each. This will be explored as part of Module 6 – How To Design A Coherent Curriculum.\n\nFor the purpose of this module, we are going to consider it from the perspective of a single explanation. This refers to breaking down complex ideas or tasks into smaller steps. This supports the amount of information being handled by the working memory as it reduces the number of ‘slots’ you are filling with new information to process. It also supports you as the teacher to assess pupils’ understanding after each step. If pupils have not understood, you can reteach or modify the explanation as required.\n\nBreaking down complex ideas into smaller steps is a difficult task, even for experienced teachers, and it takes time to consider what the steps are. It requires both subject knowledge and pedagogical knowledge; you need to consider what the logical steps are for the subject matter and the amount of information that your pupils will be able to handle (based on their age and experience in the topic).\n\nAn example of how a complex idea could be broken into smaller steps can be seen below. This maths example is taken from Doug Lemov’s book ‘Teach Like a Champion 2.0’ (2015). When teaching pupils to round numbers to a given place value, the following steps can be used:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Breaking-steps-down-to-be-built-directly-into-platform-1.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n## Introducing new knowledge to pupils\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink carefully about the example above and make notes on the following questions:\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Why does breaking the explanation down into these five steps avoid\n      overloading the working memory?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What prior knowledge is the teacher assuming the pupils have?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Would the explanation be different if the pupils were already proficient\n      at a number of the steps?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What else would breaking the explanation down into these steps support the\n      teacher to do?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ol>\nWatch the video below of a teacher breaking down an idea into smaller steps.

You will then be asked to practise breaking a concept or idea down into smaller steps with your mentor for the lesson you taught, or an upcoming concept.\n\nWhen creating your steps in preparation for this observation, it is helpful to consider:\n\n1. What knowledge am I assuming the pupils have?\n2. Why have I chosen the steps that I have? Would it be beneficial to break them down further?\n3. Even after breaking down the concept, am I introducing too much in one go and risking overloading my pupils? If so, what can I do?\n\n## Combing verbal and graphical representations\n\nAnother way to support learning is by combining verbal explanations and graphical representations. You may hear this referred to in educational research as the principle of Dual Coding.\n\nWhy is this a useful strategy when introducing new knowledge to pupils?\n\nCombining a verbal explanation with a relevant diagram or visual representation reduces the load on the working memory as it makes use of both the visual and auditory paths in the brain. It is particularly useful when the concept is hierarchical, such as an organisational structure, or has organisations and connections that are not linear (Caviglioli, 2019).\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Diagram shows the relationship between working and long-term memory, with information being recalled from long-term to working memory when needed and processed into long-term for storage. Environmental factors also input into working memory. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Simplest-model-of-the-mind.jpg $EndURL $Caption Willingham (2009) $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThis course took advantage of this principle when you were introduced to the Willingham model of the mind. As the concept is not linear and relies on the relationship between the different elements of the mind, if this model was explained using only text, the concept would have been harder to explain and understand.\n\nListen to teacher Jon Hutchinson talk about how he has learnt to effectively combine verbal explanations and graphical representation in order to support teaching and learning.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/l8oGAk2_IM8)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nCombining verbal and graphical representation – John Hutchinson\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nSo we know that information is processed by pupils through a few different sensory inputs. The two main ones being the auditory and the visual inputs and those different sensors have different advantages and disadvantages, so through auditory input we have a linear explanation. It can be very rich but it also means that we're limited by that linear nature whereas if we present something visually we're able to present that information in a non-linear way so we can show organizations and connections that we might not be able to do so easily in an auditory way. And so we want to capitalise on the way that dual coding can help us embed the information that we want pupils to learn in a more robust and sophisticated way. And so we capitalized on a few different ways, one of which is we hugely cut down on the extraneous load that we expect, that we put on pupils, so I know that I used to put lots and lots of text on the board when I was teaching a topic, especially one I wasn't confident on, mainly because I wanted to read it off the board but we know that's likely to really overload the pupils and they can't process both their own internal auditory voice from reading the text and listening to me and so that will result in cognitive overload, so we now use just key images when we're using slideshows and presentations and the explanation will come from the teacher. That might mean that what was on the board gets printed off so that the teacher can read it out over the image. So that when people see that sort of image, or imagine that sort of concrete example, they bring back to mind the rich explanation the teacher gave as well.\n\nAnd the second way is presenting the information in a synchronous way so that's especially helpful for things like hierarchies, for things like cause relations often come up in things like history, how the First World War was caused, that the acronym that we often use there is main militaries of militarism alliances, imperialism and nationalism, and how do those different sorts of causal relationships connect with the start of the First World War best present that through some sort of an image or a flow diagram so that pupils can appreciate that relationship. Within geography we’ll have lots of processes, the water cycle for example, again best presented, that relationship, through a visual, through some sort of visual stimulus in which the arrows can point out the particular nature of the relationship and so we'll think about the best way to present that information and try and utilise both the visual and the auditory senses as they go through.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nIn the video, Jon shared some examples of how his school has combined verbal explanations and relevant graphics to support pupils’ understanding of new knowledge.

The aim of these strategies is to avoid overloading their working memory, therefore giving pupils a better chance of learning and remembering the information. This session will explore a further method to achieve the same goal:\n\n- Using worked and partially completed examples\n\n## Using worked and partially completed examples\n\nA worked example is a problem that has already been solved for the pupil, with every step fully explained and clearly shown. The beauty of a worked example is that they make visible an expert’s problem-solving solution, and then this is shared with the novice pupil as an example to learn from.\n\nThey also free up the pupil’s working memory by shifting the focus from finding the correct answer to understanding and learning the steps in the example. This means that they are more likely to recall how to solve this type of problem when they are faced with it in the future (CESE, 2018).\n\nWhen you are creating a worked example, you are not aiming to reduce the complexity of the knowledge being learnt and remove any of the academic rigour around it. The knowledge will remain complex and pupils will need to partake in effortful thinking in order to understand it. But worked examples are effective at removing any extraneous information and distractions that would stop pupils being able to think deeply about each step of the process. With the support of the example they can focus instead on the content and exactly how an expert would solve it.\n\nEffective worked examples often share the following features:\n\n- They offer a clear structure and reasoning behind the steps shown\n- They take pupils through the problem to its logical conclusion without any step being left to interpretation\n- The teacher talks through their reasoning, sharing their expert thinking and understanding\n- After studying a worked example, learners require practise on their own to provide them with feedback on whether they have learned it or not\n\nPartially completed examples are worked examples that have had some steps left blank for pupils to complete. They allow the teacher to direct the pupil to where the practise needs to take place. The idea behind a partially completed example is that you are directing pupils to where you want them to focus their thinking.\n\nListen to Ben Riley from Deans for Impact talk about why worked examples can be so effective in reducing the risk of overloading the working memory. He also talks through a worked example of how to solve a crossword puzzle, modelling how he would share his thought process aloud as he would do with his pupils.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/qCUDyngrGfM)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nWorked examples - Benjamin Riley\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIn this module, I'm going to talk with you about a particularly useful insight from cognitive science around creating something called a ‘worked example’ and why it can be so useful to you as a teacher.\n\nSo let me start first with a very simple definition of what a worked example is. A worked example is simply a step by step explanation of how to solve a problem. That may seem obvious and sound like easy to do but it's actually quite interesting to explore how to do it effectively as a teacher. And rather than talk about that in the abstract I thought I'd take a bit of a chance here and actually try to create a worked example here in this video with you around solving crossword puzzles. Now I know immediately some of you just groaned and have, what, nothing to do with this and a few of you might also already love doing puzzles and this might seem a bit redundant so I apologize to both of you but trust me I think if we explore this together you'll find it interesting and think about how it can apply to situations, anything you might want to teach. But I actually think crossword puzzles contain an awful lot within them that help explain our cognitive architecture and I'll explain that as we go along.\n\nOk so let me start by saying if I wanted to teach you how to solve a crossword puzzle what would I not do, what would be a bad example? Well, one thing that I certainly wouldn't do is give you a bunch of crossword puzzles with the clues already filled in and say study these. That, I think, would probably not improve your performance in solving crossword puzzles at all and the reason for that is you're not actually going to be learning a strategy for how to solve the problem. You're going to be learning at best what some of the answers to some clues are but unless the puzzle contains that same clue again it's really not going to be very helpful. So worked examples are not just about giving students the answer, it's really about figuring out a process and making it very explicit what that process is so that students can use that to sort of alleviate their cognitive burden when they're solving a problem that may appear new and novel to them.\n\nSo let's dive in, let's say for now that I'm going to try to teach you, give you, a worked example for solving a crossword. So here's the first thing that I'd start with: I'd look for all the clues that are what I call ‘fill in the blank’. Here's an example: let's say in the crossword we're doing three across is PRIME blank now my guess is many of you immediately started thinking of what could follow this PRIME. I suspect many of you immediately thought ‘Minister’ a few of you who are hungry may think ‘rib’ and perhaps a few Star Trek aficionados thought 'directive', but my guess is for those of you are in the UK, Minister is the first thing that came to mind so let's just take a look here. We've got a box with I believe eight letters I'm just gonna see if that fits. Good idea to usually do this in pencil but lo and behold: Boom! Minister. Great, so that would be step one and it's worth thinking about just for a second why would we want to start with blanks like that and the answer is, my opinion, the creator of the puzzle has actually made your cognitive load a little bit easier by giving you half the information you need already. For whatever reason, those sort of clues are usually the ones that people immediately go to because again it doesn't tax as much of our memory and our consciousness as some of the other clues will, which we'll come to in a second. So, we might go through the puzzle, see all of the fill in the blanks, see how many of those we can solve but what will we do next? Well, we might then turn to attacking the three-letter clues. So, let's for example look at one that I've created for this puzzle. 17 down has ‘TV in the UK’. Think about that for a second. Right, you've got it right I'm sure many of you immediately thought BBC. Now why would we start with attacking the three-letter clues? Well, it's because there's only three letters. And so again we're looking for ways to make puzzles easier for us to think through rather than more challenging. So, starting with the three-letter clues after the fill in the blank should help us fill in the puzzle in ways that will make it a little bit less taxing on the cognitive process that we're doing. Now again we are doing effortful thinking, that's good, and we're pulling things from our memory into our working memory in order to solve these clues.\n\nOne thing I will just note for crossword puzzles too is if there's little things you might learn or put into your worked example like clues that have acronyms in them typically have acronyms as their solutions. It's things like that when you're starting to teach somebody something that you want to make that very explicit. You can allow them to discover it on their own by doing this over and over again but why not make it easier up front? In time they will learn it and then it will become sort of their background knowledge but it's really important with a worked example or frankly when teaching anything to try to be as explicit as you can when first introducing a concept to a pupil.\n\nSo now we've populated our puzzle with a few solutions we can look at it and see where do we have what I call ‘first letters’ and that is what I mean where some of the letters that we've filled in give us the first letter for one of the other clues. So let's just imagine for a second that there's this clue, five down, and it says ‘luxurious autos’. Now if you're like me you might immediately think, ok, Mercedes Benz, you drop down and it's like ooh that's promising that looks like a lot of letters. Looks like about eleven here but you try to type Mercedes or write Mercedes and that doesn't fit and or say Mercedes Benz is too long. Hmm! Have a look - it’s tough right? Now, what if I told you that our Prime Minister solution crossed with this and so that we actually know the first letter in this. The first letter is ‘R’. Gotta think for a second. My guess is that a lot of you just thought of the answer to this. The answer is Rolls Royces. How elegant is that? Of course, they break down a lot but this is not to disparage British engineering. So, this is a worked example that I've rapidly created here of how I might teach people to solve crossword puzzles. Look for fill in the blanks, attack the three-letter and then find first letters. Now here's the thing about teaching – there's a lot of different ways in which I could have created a worked example for crossword puzzles. There's no one way to do it. The key is to think about why it's important to step through all the processes for your students and to understand that for them encountering new things like this are gonna be things they might naturally resist and that we're actually trying to alleviate as much as we can in the early stage of something, the cognitive effort that it takes and that's the joy of teaching is that there is no one way of doing that and for basically everything that you might teach you're gonna be responsible for figuring out and imagining how to create a worked example like this to help your students.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Worked and partially completed examples in action\n\nIn this section you will hear from teachers explaining why they have found worked and partially complete examples useful for focusing pupil thinking and sharing their expert knowledge. You can also see examples of teachers using worked examples in action in their classroom. Select videos to view that are most appropriate to your phase.\n\nHear from English Teacher Joseph Craven as he talks through how he incorporated a worked example into an end of unit lesson to support pupils to effectively answer an exam question.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/Iu3RrB6FFWg)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nWorked examples - Joseph Craven at Northern Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWorked examples are a hugely important part of the learning process. They offer a model of expert thinking and processing and they demonstrate how an expert would apply their knowledge when working to answer a question.\n\nThey are also beneficial as they give the teacher an insight into their pupils’ perspective when faced with solving a new problem. It can be difficult to know how to answer a question or how to effectively break down a task if it isn’t something you’ve worked through and completed yourself. As a teacher you should be considering your pupils' prior knowledge and then tailor the worked example to be built on this and accessible to them. There’s also the old danger of providing worked examples that aren’t replicable. There’s no end of teachers who have spent an hour writing a worked example to a question that a pupil has 20 minutes to answer, meaning that the quantity and quality of the response isn’t actually a replicable model. You will course naturally take a little longer to create the example to ensure it includes everything you want to demonstrate and to ensure it is designed in a way that will alleviate some of the load placed on the working memory. However, as the expert, it shouldn’t take you much longer to create than it would take your pupils to answer.\n\nWorked examples can be introduced at almost any point as a learning tool, but I typically use them in English once the class are secure in all the foundational concepts and then I used the worked example as a way of demonstrating how to pull all that learning together. I like to think about them almost as an apprenticeship model:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Here’s a beautiful example</li>\n  <li>Here’s a master craftsman crafting a beautiful example</li>\n  <li>\n    Let’s work through the process of crafting a beautiful example together\n  </li>\n  <li>Now you create a beautiful example and I’m here to help if needed</li>\n  <li>Now you create a beautiful example independently</li>\n</ul>\nIn the example shared below, it is important to know the class were already familiar\nwith the topic. We’d been working on the opening of ‘An Inspector Calls’ for a few\nweeks, and they knew the characters, the opening of the narrative and so on. With\nthis in mind, and a secure foundation of knowledge on which to build, I felt a worked\nexample would help me demonstrate how they could pull all this learning together\nwhen answering an exam question.\n\nThe worked example was actually written by a very able pupil from the previous year, and expertly demonstrated the learning points I needed the class to pick up. The dissection shown underneath the example shares the focus and rationale for each step of the process. It’s structured as an effective paragraph (a clear point, valid evidence that’s embedded, explanation and analysis with a zoom in on a specific word, some technical terminology, and a link to the whole text). I talked through this with the class, sharing my thoughts on why this is such an excellent example at each stage. Following on from this, we would create a further example together, then the pupils would attempt an example independently. At this point I can see what steps in the process individuals have remembered. At other times, I’d produce the initial model myself, but I’d very much want to ensure that it’s of a practicable, replicable quality and length.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Worked example</h3>\nAt the beginning of the play, Priestley presents the inspector as an enigmatic, almost\nwilfully nondescript figure.

It is used to help reduce cognitive load when pupils are learning new content or a new skill. It is a form of scaffolding to develop expertise as it allows the pupils to add to the answer themselves, developing the explanation of a key concept. I would use this strategy at a point in pupils' learning where they had previously seen a fully worked example, or as a scaffold for a task.\n\nI recently used it to support pupils in a task where the outcome was to explain the formation of erosional coastal features. At the beginning of the lesson, I verbally explained the formation of a wave cut platform and supported my explanation with photographs and relevant diagrams. I used the acronym SPED, which stands for Sequence, Process, Explanation and Description, as this helps to break the answer down into smaller components. Throughout the explanation, I checked for pupil understanding through questioning. Once I was satisfied that pupils were ready to begin, I explained the task to them.\n\nThey were given a partially completed explanation of the formation of erosional coastal features and were asked to complete it. This involved developing some points further and including additional detail that was missing. The level of detail missing varied for different pupils according to their current understanding on the topic. This ensured that pupils were able to focus their learning on key points without experiencing working memory overload. It developed pupils' understanding as they were required to identify what was missing from the partially completed example and therefore understand what is needed to give a full geographical answer.\n\nWhen planning this activity, I began by creating a good explanation that followed the structure of SPED and contained fully developed points. I then removed the information that I wanted the pupils to practise recalling. This ensured their recall focused on key learning points and skills that we had been working to develop.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nTo see worked and partially completed examples in action in the classroom, click on the relevant link below.

It is thought that the long-term memory changes and expands as pupils integrate new ideas with existing knowledge. However, that does not mean that we remember everything that we process in our working memory. Over time, the chances of forgetting a memory increase.\n\nUnderstanding how information is stored in the long-term memory can help you plan how to effectively retrieve and practise key knowledge. This next section is going to look at the storage system of the long-term memory, also called ‘mental models’.\n\n## Mental models\n\nWhen the mind is presented with new information, it searches the long-term memory for any prior knowledge that will support the understanding and processing of the concept. If the mind finds some useful knowledge to support the working memory, then the newly acquired knowledge is added to an ever-growing web of information around this topic. We refer to these interconnected webs as ‘mental models’, or you may hear them referred to as ‘schemata’.\n\nThe diagrams below represent two mental models. The dots represent pieces of information and the lines represent links between them. The first diagram shows a well-developed, organised mental model of a topic. When a new piece of information is added, it will be processed and understood in relation to the existing information and links.\n\nWhere the mental model is less developed (diagram 2), the knowledge may exist in isolation. Where this is the case, the information is less embedded into memory, meaning that it is weaker and more likely to be forgotten. It is also much more likely to be misunderstood, and in turn, it is likely that misconceptions will develop around the information.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Evenly spaced and connected dots represent a well-developed and organised mental model of a topic. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Diagram-1.jpg $EndURL $Caption Diagram 1 $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Uneven spacing of dots with some connections missing, resulting in some isolated dots.

Not only will this help with a pupil’s ability to process new information, but secure subject knowledge will support with the levels of engagement and motivation experienced by the pupil. When a pupil understands what is being taught to them quickly, feels confident in giving answers, and experiences success, this will likely lead to an increase in confidence, motivation and enjoyment in the learning. It is therefore important to think carefully about the key knowledge and foundational concepts that you want pupils to master before moving on, ensuring that pupils have secure prior knowledge to which they can link their learning.\n\nSo, what can you do as a teacher to help pupils develop an organised mental model around a topic, and ensure that the knowledge held within it is not forgotten? The next section looks at ways of strengthening the recall of knowledge.\n\n## Strengthening the recall of knowledge\n\nHow quickly a piece of knowledge can be recalled when needed depends on two factors:\n\n1. Its **retrieval strength** - retrieval strength refers to how easily you can retrieve a piece of knowledge from your working memory. As a teacher, you want knowledge to have a high retrieval strength, so that your pupils can recall facts easily.\n2. Its **storage strength** - storage strength is how embedded or connected a memory is in your mind. As a teacher you want knowledge to have a high storage strength so that the memory does not fade over time.\n\nYour aim would be to support pupils to have knowledge that has a **high retrieval strength** and a **high storage strength**. This means that pupils would be quick to recall knowledge when asked a question about it (high retrieval strength), and would be able to remember it in two months’ time when they needed to use the knowledge again (high storage strength).\n\nAn example of a memory that has high retrieval and high storage strength is your current address. Regardless of when or where you were asked for your address, you would be able to tell someone what it was without hesitation.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Window displaying the relationship between retrieval and storage strength. With the bottom of both scales resulting in knowledge that is not easily retrieved and not easily retained. The top of both scales resulting in knowledge that is easily retrieved and easily retained. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Retreival-and-storage-strength.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nIn the classroom you may teach a lesson on a concept or topic and assess it at the end of the lesson with a large success rate. A couple of weeks later, the same assessment is likely to lead to a much lower success rate, as the memory has moved from being highly retrievable to less so. The memory that the pupils have of the learning had an initially high retrieval strength, but it was not thoroughly embedded in the long-term memory and therefore had a low storage strength.\n\nThe question for teachers is, how do you create a memory that is high storage and has a high retrieval rate, effectively converting thinking into long-term learning?\n\nTo answer this, let’s go back and consider why your current address might be easily retrieved and easily retained. The answer is because of the number of times you have repeated it, how often you have recalled it into your working memory, and how many times you have practised writing it down or explaining it to someone. You have recalled this information many times, increasing the storage strength, so that when asked, you can retrieve the information in a flash.\n\nThis principle should be applied to the learning of any key knowledge or concepts that you want your pupils to retain. It is important that you build in regular time in your lessons for pupils to practise and repeat what has been previously taught, retrieving the critical knowledge from their long-term memory. If you do not build in this additional practice, the knowledge will become weak, and pupils will not be able to recall the information when it is needed. Throughout this Early Career Framework course, you will see this principle in action: concepts are purposefully returned to in order to increase the retrieval and storage strength in your long-term memory and help you embed them as part of your everyday teaching practice.\n\nIn the next section we will explore effective strategies that will support the retrieval of key information.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nHave you experienced your pupils showing a high retrieval rate at the end of the\nlesson but low storage rate when you returned to the concept later in the term? What\nwas the context? Did it affect all pupils equally? $CTA\n\n## Building mental models\n\nIn this section we will explore strategies for how you can support the recall and retrieval of knowledge and build well-developed mental models in pupils to support deeper understanding of concepts and topics.\n\n### Strategy 1: Building on prior knowledge\n\nSession 1 of this module looked at the importance of linking new learning to pupils’ prior knowledge as a strategy to avoid overloading the working memory. The importance of doing this is highlighted further in this section by recognising that building on prior knowledge also leads to a more developed mental model. This means that when a new piece of information is added to the model, it will be processed and understood in relation to the existing information. The more linked the knowledge is within the mental model, the more likely it is for the pupil to retain the information.\n\nIt is important to note that for most topics taught in schools, pupils will come with an existing mental model. This model, however, may be small or unorganised, and will most likely contain large knowledge gaps and misconceptions. This makes your pupils novices in the concepts and knowledge to be learned. As the teacher, you will have a relatively developed mental model in the topic, making you an expert. This is an important distinction, as novices and experts think and learn about concepts in a different way. For novices, the gaps in knowledge need to be identified and content explicitly taught so that the teacher can be sure that strong foundations are in place, and mental models can develop in an organised way. Lessons should be sequenced carefully so that the foundational knowledge around a concept is secure, before encountering more complex content. Where this does not happen, the teacher may be building on unstable foundations, leading to further misconceptions later. As an expert in the topic, it is easy for teachers to underestimate the amount of explicit teaching and practice required for what may appear a relatively simple concept. An expert can quickly absorb and make sense of new information, hanging it on existing knowledge. However, for novice learners to process information into their long-term memory takes considerable teaching, practice and revisiting.\n\n### Strategy 2: Spaced exposition and practice\n\nA further way to support the recall and retrieval of knowledge and build a well-developed mental model is through spaced exposition and practice. Spaced practice means that opportunities to review information previously taught are integrated into the curriculum at spaced intervals.\n\nStudies have shown that pupils remember much more when they have been exposed to information on two occasions, rather than just one (Pashler et al, 2007). Spacing practice increases the storage and retrieval strength of the information, making it more readily recalled into the working memory for problem solving.\n\nHere is an example of a medium-term plan for Year 9 History. The teacher has thought carefully about the sequence in which the knowledge will be introduced to pupils. Within the plan they have also outlined what the spaced practice focus will be each week. You can see that the topic ‘The Treaty of Versailles’ will be covered a total of three times, ensuring a better chance of high storage and retrieval strength and a more developed mental model around this topic.\n\n[KS4 History Medium Term Plan](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/11/Northern-Education-Trust_History-Planning-Document_Year-9-Updated-Version.pdf)\n\n### Strategy 3: Retrieval practice\n\nThe final strategy is to use retrieval practice to support the automatic recall of key knowledge. Retrieval practice is different from simply revisiting the material. Instead, pupils are asked to recall knowledge from their memory. Some levels of forgetting are inevitable; however, forgetting some of the information and then trying to recall it actually strengthens the eventual learning. Creating regular opportunities in lesson time for pupils to recall information from previous lessons will support them to build long-term memory and will allow you as the teacher to check what pupils are remembering, and if any misconceptions have developed.\n\nAn effective method of providing retrieval opportunities is through low-stakes quizzes. These are simple to create, quick for the pupils to complete, and the answers can be shared immediately for instant feedback. It also allows you to draw questions from the previous lesson, or further back in the unit.\n\nAn example of a simple low-stakes retrieval quiz can be found below. As you can see, it focuses thinking on the key knowledge that the teacher wants pupils to recall.\n\n[Low-stakes retrieval quiz](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Module-2-Example-of-a-retrieval-quiz.docx)\n\nListen again to teacher Lee Donaghy talk about how he used retrieval practice to secure knowledge into the pupils’ long-term memory.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/JxdC9wxm-rQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nRetrieval practice - Lee Donaghy at Teach First\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nFurther on in my teaching of the module ‘USA 1945-75’ with my year 10 GCSE history class, we came to focus on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. When completing their assessments on the previous topic of the Red Scare, many of my pupils had struggled to recall and therefore use their contextual knowledge when answering questions as I had not been systematic enough in my use of retrieval. I reflected that I therefore needed to be more systematic both in identifying the key items of knowledge in this new topic that would underpin pupils’ understanding, and in my use of regular retrieval practice throughout the topic to encode this knowledge in their long-term memories.\n\nThe main resource I used to teach this Civil Rights topic was the course textbook &lt;show slide 1&gt;, which had a series of double page spreads, similar to this one, focused on a key aspect of the movement. The bulk of time in the first lesson on each aspect was taken up reading one of these spreads, and highlighting, clarifying and summarising the events, people and concepts described. Therefore, I selected the key knowledge I wanted pupils to retain from these spreads when planning lessons, cross-referencing this with the exam specification’s ‘specific content’ to ensure I was selecting the most important information.\n\nI could then write a set of low-stakes quiz questions for each aspect of the topic &lt;show slide 2&gt;, which in this example was the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown vs. Board of Education that led to segregation in schools in the USA being declared unconstitutional. After the first lesson on this aspect I set these questions as homework for the pupils to revise. Each subsequent lesson on this aspect then began with the same 10-15 questions. As you can see, the questions are quite detailed and only require short answers. This, combined with asking them in the same order each time, initially provided support for pupils to experience a high success rate when retrieving this information.\n\nThe impact of this was clear, as you can see from this record of pupils’ scores in the quizzes &lt;show slide 3&gt;. I set the expectation that pupils would master 100% of this content during the sequence of lessons on this particular aspect, re-testing specific pupils at break times and lunch times if necessary.\n\n&lt;show slide 4&gt; Once this content was mastered, I was keen to ensure both that pupils retained it beyond the specific sequence of lessons in which they had learnt it, and that I increased the challenge with practice and retrieval as their knowledge became more secure. To do this, I collapsed the knowledge covered in the original 10 quiz questions into a single task, which I asked pupils to complete at the end of two separate lessons on the next aspect of the topic, which was the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This task is less scaffolded than the set of quiz questions, requiring them to select independently the items of knowledge that would form the list of main events of the Brown vs. Board case.\n\nSecondly, to increase the challenge further, once we had covered the entire sequence of events that made up the campaign for civil rights in the 1950s, I prompted pupils to recall the main events of the entire decade on a single timeline. This both increased the amount of knowledge pupils were asked to retrieve and again forced them to select and sequence a series of events independently.\n\nThe effect of this use of retrieval was obvious in pupils’ performance in their subsequent assessment &lt;show slide 5&gt;. Where previously pupils used little contextual knowledge in their answers, now they were able to draw on the knowledge of events, people and concepts securely stored in their long-term memory. The highlighted yellow text represents the specific contextual knowledge used by the same pupil in their previous assessment on the left, when little or no systematic retrieval was used, and in their post-retrieval assessment on the right. And this effect was clear on the whole class level too as the average pupil assessment score increased from around 45% in the assessment with little or no retrieval, to just over 60% in the two assessments where retrieval was employed.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs pupil knowledge became more secure, Lee began to increase the challenge of the retrieval practice by asking pupils to instead apply their knowledge to a task. With the knowledge held within the mental model now being so secure, he felt confident that the pupils could create new links to strengthen the model further.\n\nDeveloping a well-curated retrieval quiz is something you will explore with your mentor during your next training session.\n\nAs pupils become more secure in their knowledge and their mental model becomes more developed, you should be able to increase the intervals between the spaced practice and increase the level of challenge of the retrieval task.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Activity</h3>\nLook at the medium-term plan for either your current or an upcoming unit of work.\nUsing the knowledge and examples shared in this session as a guide, build small opportunities\ninto your plan for spaced practice and retrieval practice to strengthen pupils’ long-term\nmemory. This will be used as part of your next training session, where you will share\nelements of your plan and your rationale behind them.\n\nIf you have already included opportunities for spaced and retrieval practice into your planning documents, prepare to discuss your answers to the following questions at your next training session.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Where have you incorporated spaced practice and why?</li>\n  <li>Where have you incorporated retrieval practice and why?</li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Research into how pupils learn\n\nWhen you entered the teaching profession, you came with your own established mental model of what ‘teaching’ and ‘how pupils learn’ looked like. The content of this module may be building on prior knowledge in your mental model, and you may feel confident to apply the content directly to your practice with the support of your mentor. Alternatively, the content may be new learning, and you feel that there will be some retrieval of the concepts needed. You will have the opportunity to speak to your mentor weekly about the knowledge covered in this module and attend two training sessions that look in more detail at elements of the key knowledge.\n\nThe aim of this module is to share with you the most recent research on how pupils learn best. It is important to acknowledge that claims of strategies based on the mind and how pupils learn are not new. In the recent past, some of these strategies have not been based on robust evidence, resulting in teacher practice that does not always have maximum impact for pupils. However, some of these strategies may be very familiar to you and your colleagues, and they may even be established in your mental model of what a ‘teacher’ does.\n\nListen again to Ben Riley, CEO of Deans for Impact, talking about why it is important for teachers to have a mental model that contains knowledge of research-driven teaching methods, and how to work with your colleagues to implement these into the wider school practice.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/3W9z7SOIJz8)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nMental models – Benjamin Riley\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI want to talk to you about mental models and why it's important for teachers to have a mental model of their students that incorporates our best scientific understanding of how students think and learn. My friend Dan Willingham, the cognitive scientist, said has this phrase he uses which is that ‘every teacher, whether implicitly or explicitly, has a theory of how learning takes place with their students’. So if you think about it when a teacher does something, some action, they're intending for something to happen on the part of their students that will lead to some sort of learning outcome and really what we want and what I think the early career frameworks in the UK have done so admirably is to say that we want that theory to be our best available scientific one and to not use unscientific theories in our teaching.\n\nBut now I want to talk about a theory of learning that's widely prevalent but unfortunately doesn't have the support of our scientific inquiries and that's learning styles. Now I may trigger a few people here, so I just want you to bear with me. So, the theory of learning styles is that different people learn more effectively depending on having that information presented in the way they would prefer. So you may have heard people say well I'm a visual learner. You may even think of yourself as a visual learner. Other people might say I'm an audio learner, I learn best by listening to something, and still others might say I'm a kinesthetic learner, I learn best by moving around.\n\nIt's a completely plausible theory. A lot of people have it. You may even have it. Here's the thing: we've studied it, we've looked at it, not just once, not just twice, but over and over and over again and as best we can tell using scientific inquiry there's just very little evidence that presenting someone information in their preferred style is at all effective in helping them improve their learning. I know that that doesn't sound right. We think that we must learn a certain way and we know that we like these ways but here's the deal: often our intuitions about learning can be mistaken. I mean this is really why the tools of cognitive science are so important for teachers because we might have all these beliefs about what we think works but we really want to turn and rely on what we've studied and investigated time and again and use that to inform our mental model of what’s taking place with our students. That's what's going to be more effective for them and frankly make it easier for you.\n\nSo going forward if you investigate this, if you come around to the position that I again would submit to you is scientifically supported which is that learning styles is not a particularly effective strategy to use with your students, what happens when you start hearing some of your teaching colleagues who believe firmly in that? Let me just say that I have found in my life that it's not particularly effective to say ‘well, you're wrong and the science says so’. What you instead might want to try is see if you can shift the topic a bit and say you know I've been really interested in this dual coding approach to learning and I've been trying it with some of my students and let's investigate that together and maybe by working together with your colleagues you can give them a new mental model of how to approach their teaching. You don't try to just disprove something that they may already believe but you instead create an alternative possibility they can employ. That's what I think makes effective educating. Often it's not so much about you need to know this or else you're, you know, ill-advised or dare I say stupid, but instead trying to give people something new that they can use and find powerful in their own teaching and in their own life so I don't know if this module could rise that high but I hope you found it somewhat helpful and I hope you have encoded it.

The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) have found that when harnessed effectively, these strategies can improve attainment of disadvantaged learners (EEF, 2018). Therefore, it is important to explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies linked to their subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate their work. This short session will aim to give you an introduction to metacognition and self-regulation, which will be built upon during your next mentor interaction.\n\n### Self-regulation\n\nSelf-regulation concerns the extent to which learners are aware of their strengths, weaknesses, and the strategies they use to learn.\n\nIn their[ guidance report](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf), the EEF (2018) state that cognition and metacognition are important parts of self-regulation.\n\n### Cognition\n\nSimply put, cognition is thinking. It’s the mental process of knowing, understanding and learning (EEF, 2018). A good way to understand what cognition is, is to think of it as pupils thinking through a cognitive strategy. Pupils will learn many cognitive strategies when at school, and they will be subject specific. For example, if in maths pupils need to solve multiplication, they might have different cognitive strategies for doing so, such as using times tables, the box method, or long multiplication. These different strategies for solving multiplication are the pupils’ cognitive strategies that they draw upon when working independently to solve problems. All these strategies are important for the pupil to know. However, the pupil needs to understand which strategy would be best to apply when solving different problems. For example, using times table facts to solve 7 x 8 would be efficient, but using times table facts alone to solve 1365 x 189 would be much more challenging. Pupils need to decide which strategies they should use and when. That’s where metacognition comes in.\n\n### Metacognition\n\nSimply put, this is pupils' thinking about their thinking (EEF, 2018). When approaching any task, pupils do so with metacognitive knowledge about:\n\n- What the activity is asking them to do\n- What cognitive strategies they could use\n- Their own abilities and attitudes - knowledge of themselves as a learner\n\nWhen undertaking a learning task, pupils start with this knowledge, then apply and adapt it. This is metacognitive regulation.\n\n#### Metacognitive regulation\n\nMetacognitive regulation is when pupils plan, monitor and evaluate their thinking using their metacognitive knowledge. The diagram below helps to illustrate this process:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Metacognitive regulation occurs as a cyclical process. Pupils use their metacognitive knowledge to plan their cognitive strategy. Then they will monitor this strategy during use and evaluate it after, therefore improving their metacognition. $EndAlt $URL http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Metacognition-model-min-scaled.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n#### **Planning**\n\nWhen approaching a task, effective metacognitive learners have knowledge of what the task is asking them to do, knowledge of the cognitive strategies they could use, and knowledge of their own ability. They should use this information to plan the best cognitive strategy to use.\n\n#### Monitoring\n\nWhen using a specific cognitive strategy during a task, pupils should monitor how effective that cognitive strategy is. If they find it unsuccessful, then they should try a different cognitive strategy.\n\n#### Evaluating\n\nOnce pupils have completed the task, they should evaluate how successful they were, so they know which strategies to use next time. By doing this, they begin to learn from their own experiences and refine their approach to completing similar tasks.\n\n$I\n\n<h4>Example</h4>\nTo help make this clear, let’s link back to session 1 and the maths example we explored\nwhen thinking about avoiding working memory overload. Imagine a pupil has been set\nthe question of solving 1365 x 189. Effective learners will apply metacognitive regulation\nwhilst answering that question. An example of their metacognitive thinking is shown\nbelow:\n\n<strong>Step 1: Planning:</strong>\nFirst, the pupil examines the question. They can see it's multiplication from the\noperator symbol used. They know they are good at their times tables, so they decide\nto use their times tables to work it out.\n\n<strong>Step 2: Monitoring:</strong>\nSecond, when using their times tables, they become a little confused about which\nnumbers they have multiplied and which numbers they still have left. They think they\nneed to add some amounts together but are unsure. They realise that the strategy\nisn’t very successful, so attempt to use long multiplication instead. They find this\nstrategy much easier because they can keep track of which numbers they have already\nmultiplied, and they are able to complete the question.\n\n<strong>Step 3: Evaluating:</strong>\nAfter the task, they reflect on their initial approach and decide that when trying\nto multiply large numbers, they will use long multiplication rather than their times\ntables.\n\n<strong>Summary:</strong>\nIn the above example, the pupil has been able to self-regulate their learning. They\nwere able to acknowledge their own strengths and weaknesses when completing a task\nand, as a result, identified which strategy is most successful for them when multiplying\nlarge numbers together. When they come across a similar problem in the future, they\ncan use what they have learned to inform their choice of cognitive strategy. This\nwill refine their ability to solve these types of question. $I\n\nAs you progress through the modules in this programme, sessions will return to the concept of self-regulation and metacognition several times. As you revisit and retrieve these concepts, the content within the modules will help build your knowledge of strategies that you can use to support the development of metacognition in your pupils.\n\n## The importance of subject knowledge\n\n> \"Self-regulated learning and metacognition have often been found to be context-dependent, so how you best plan in Key Stage 2 art may have significant differences to planning strategies in GCSE maths.\n>\n> This means that a pupil who shows strong self-regulated learning and metacognitive competence in one task or subject domain may be weak in another, and metacognitive strategies may or may not be effective, depending on the specific task, subject, or problem tackled.\"\n>\n> (EEF, 2018, page 24)\n\nPupils cannot use metacognition if they do not have a good understanding of the subject upon which the task is based. For example, if pupils do not understand what multiplication is, or only have one strategy to solve a multiplication problem, they will not be able to implement metacognitive regulation. In order to evaluate how successful a cognitive strategy is, pupils need to have sufficient knowledge of the strategy itself. They also need alternative strategies they can draw upon when one doesn’t work.\nFor expert learners, cognition and metacognition become largely unconscious and automatic, but in novice learners they are not. Therefore, it is important that teachers support pupils to use cognitive and metacognitive strategies in all subjects across the curriculum. This is something that will be explored further with your mentor in your next session and will be explored in different modules throughout the programme.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Classroom practice\n\n4.5 Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.\n\n", nil, "0b9f3c1e-518c-4518-ad09-4313d837e2c6"],

Once this knowledge is effortlessly recalled, pupils have become fluent. This supports learners as it frees up working memory, preventing working memory overload and leaving more capacity for learning new material. This enables pupils to be more successful in their learning which is a key factor in developing intrinsic motivation.\n\nIn the classroom, a review can occur in many forms such as checking homework, going over work where there were errors, or practising retrieving knowledge so that it becomes automatic. The latter is more commonly known as retrieval practice - a strategy you explored in module two.\n\n$CTA\nListen to Claire Stoneman share her knowledge of retrieval practice and what this might look like in the classroom.

As Professor Robert Coe reminds us, retrieval practice is strongly supported by over a hundred years of research and is one of only two learning techniques rated by Dunlosky as having high utility for classroom practice. There's a huge amount of research to support its use and yet, like many things that seem so simple in teaching, it has to be done really well or it could throw up a few calamitous pitfalls.\n\nSo why is retrieving prior knowledge a useful thing to do?\n\nIt enables the children to see their learning going somewhere, that lessons aren't just weird little modularised bite-size chunks of learning but part of a golden thread of knowledge, and Barak Rosenshine suggests that teachers begin their lesson with review of prior learning for two reasons:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    It's a practice recalling previously learnt material, thereby strengthening\n    the ability to recall it in the future.\n  </li>\n  <li>To link new material to that which has come before.</li>\n</ol>\nSo retrieval practice can be an exceptionally useful thing to do at the start of\na lesson. It's not simply recap, in other words going back over something, but it's\nabout the children actively trying to recall knowledge from their long-term memory.\n\nIt also helps the children to develop schemas that we can signpost. In their book ‘What every teacher needs to know about psychology’, David Didau and Nick Rose say that a schema has to be thought of as an organizing framework representing some aspect of the world and a system of organising that information.\n\nLet's think about that in practice for a minute. Imagine I have taught Stevenson's ‘The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ to my year 11 group. We've probably spent lots of time exploring the nature of mankind, secrets, duality, all sorts of interesting things. So when we move on to power and conflict poetry and I teach them Shelley's poem ‘Ozymandias’ and they come across the noun ‘visage’, the children will have a schema of connections about concealment upon which to draw to help them unpick the noun ‘visage’. If we can help our pupils make explicit links between these different lessons, the better they are able to develop secure schemas. And retrieval practice can really help with this.\n\nSo how can you incorporate retrieval practices in your lessons? You can start your lesson with a low-stakes quiz. They're effective, efficient and predictable. Pupils know what's coming and so it can free up working memory. Your lesson becomes a tool and an effective routine. There are of course other ways to take advantage of retrieval practice and although Rosenshine talks about using the start of the lesson to review previously learnt material, don't think that this is the only opportunity to make those things. Sometimes there will be opportunities and lessons to naturally recap on knowledge learnt in a different unit or lesson. At other times you'll want to plan in opportunities. Both are fine and really useful.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nClaire highlights two key functions of review when used to build and strengthen learning:\n\n- To consolidate material by prompting pupils to recall what they have learnt\n- To help pupils make links between new knowledge and prior knowledge and connect this in their mental model\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about a topic where you recently incorporated a review of learning and consider\nthe following questions.

As they become more proficient, the support can be slowly reduced whilst their independence during practice is increased, until they eventually are able to work independently.\n\nDuring teaching and learning, the general process for this is to begin with teacher input, followed by guided practice, followed by independent practice. Some people refer to the process of gradually building pupil independence and ownership over their learning as ‘I do (teacher input), we do (guided practice), you do (independent practice)’. This process may happen within one lesson or over a sequence of lessons to gradually build pupil knowledge and help them reach their lesson objective or learning goal. This session will focus on the process within a lesson, but you will explore how this is built in over a sequence of lessons in module 6.\n\n### Start with the lesson objective\n\nWhen planning your instruction, it is important that you begin by establishing what the lesson objective is. Once you know this, you can identify what the pupils will need to know, or be able to do, in order to achieve the lesson objective. This information should inform the focus of your teaching instruction. The explanations and modelling, guided practice and independent practice that you plan should gradually build pupils’ knowledge, working towards the lesson objective.\n\n### Gradually increase pupil independence\n\nThe process of gradually increasing pupil independence throughout a lesson can be broken down as follows:\n\n#### Teacher input\n\nThis occurs when new material is first being introduced. It involves the teacher informing, explaining, modelling and providing examples without pupil input. This is where you might use worked examples to outline the steps of a procedure to pupils.\n\nThe reason this is teacher-led without pupil input is because when new material is being introduced, pupils are novices and therefore are unlikely to have the appropriate knowledge to contribute to the process at this stage.\n\n#### Guided practice\n\nThis involves the teacher and pupils doing a task together. This is where you begin to gradually release the responsibility to your pupils. It involves you completing parts of the process and asking pupils to contribute to the incomplete parts. Here you might use partially completed examples to gradually build pupil independence.\n\n#### Independent practice\n\nThis is the stage where pupils practise new material without adult support. When first setting up independent practice, you may still provide tasks that scaffold pupils’ learning but over time these should be removed to allow pupils to work entirely independently. Rosenshine (2012) recognises that this is vital for pupils to become fluent or automatic in information retrieval or completing a procedure. During this stage, the teacher monitors pupil practice to identify and address misconceptions to individual pupils or the whole class. They also encourage pupils to use metacognitive strategies to monitor their own learning and develop their ability to self-regulate.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Key messages about this process</h3>\nWhilst these stages have been separated into three groups, the process of building\npupil independence should be viewed as a continuum whereby support gradually reduces\nas pupils become more proficient.\n\nThis will not occur in a linear fashion. In practice, you may have to shift back and forth between these three phases during a lesson to address misunderstandings or introduce further challenge.\n\nThroughout this module, building pupils’ expertise over a lesson has been broken down into different phases which are covered in different sessions. However, it is important that you remember the phases are linked and should build on one another.\n$I\n\n## Explanations and modelling – why are they so important?\n\nHigh-quality instruction enables the expert teacher to impart knowledge to the novice learner. When teaching new material, this can be done through effective explanations and modelling.\n\n### Explanations and modelling – what’s the difference?\n\nExplanations are used to introduce new material to pupils in small sequential steps, which you will have already explored in module two. During an explanation, the teacher will talk through the new material and ask pupils lots of questions to check their understanding.\n\nModelling accompanies an explanation to show pupils how to approach or complete a task. Modelling is vital during teacher explanations because it shows pupils how to do something well. Making this explicit through modelling supports pupils' understanding and builds their mental model of what ‘good’ looks like.\n\n$CTA\nListen to Claire Stoneman talk about explanations and modelling and consider the following questions. Record your response in your notepad.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What is the purpose of explanations?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why are explanations important?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What makes explanations effective?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why is modelling important?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/8ue8YBd-vsA)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nExplanations and modelling - Claire Stoneman\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIn this part of the module we'll be exploring how Rosenshine reminds us to present new material using small steps. And as part of this we’ll cover the importance of explanation and how Rosenshine also reminds us about the importance of providing models. Andy Tharby reminds us that from about the age of two children develop the intellectual ability to ask ‘why’ questions. I'm sure that this is something that those of you working in Early Years Foundation Stage can relate to. As Tharby says, children, especially very young children, go on a tireless hunt for further information and elaboration that might lift the veil on the wonders of the universe. How wonderful, and what a weighty responsibility we have to get our explanations right. So, what's the purpose of an explanation? Tharby reminds us that explanation can have a range of purposes:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>To make something understandable</li>\n  <li>To clarify and expand an idea</li>\n  <li>To give causes, context and consequences of a situation or event</li>\n  <li>Or show how facts and concepts are related and connected</li>\n</ol>\nSo effective explanations are hugely important. Tharby makes it crystal clear when\nhe says, ‘It is near impossible to conceive of effective teaching without explanation’.\nTeacher talk is vital. If the children can't access our expertise through clear,\nprecise, knowledgeable explanations they are disadvantaged. And the evidence from\ncognitive science shows that the less prior knowledge a pupil has, the more teacher\nguidance they need. So, explanations are vital for the children we teach to make\nsense of the world around them. It's hard, and again it takes lots of practice for\na novice teacher. But explanations illuminate.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn to start making links between what you know about working memory and effective explanations. Effective explanations are chunked. The teacher does not overwhelm pupils by presenting too much information at once, as the working memory can become overloaded. Information and new material are presented in small steps and often with many concrete examples. This is where modelling can come in: the importance of concrete examples so the children can see what a good or indeed a bad example looks like. As Tom Sherrington says, ‘providing models is a central feature of giving good explanations’. Models can be used in any phase of schooling and are an important element of the children having a concrete example of what it looks like. Weinstein and Sumeracki remind us that novices find abstract ideas vague and hard to grasp so concrete examples are much easier to remember. Models help to illustrate abstract ideas and make them easier to understand. Models can organize the information for the novice into a well-structured schema.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Explanations\n\nAs Claire Stoneman highlights, Rosenshine (2012) explains that in order to address the limitations of the working memory, teachers should introduce material in small steps. This is something you previously explored in module two. But, as Claire states, some material being taught can be hard to comprehend even when it is broken down and taught in small steps. This normally occurs when the material you are teaching is abstract.\n\nTo support pupil understanding when teaching an abstract concept, you should provide pupils with concrete examples and non-examples to demonstrate the concept.\n\n$CTA\nExamples and non-examples will be explored further in your next training session but in order to prepare yourself, read the following scripts. You can do this now, or return to this ahead of your training session.\n$CTA\n\nAshley Philipson shares an example of when he has used an example and a non-example to teach an abstract concept.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nUsing a concrete example by Ashley Philipson\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI use concrete examples to model abstract ideas by showing a real-world example that demonstrates the abstract concept. Abstract ideas can be vague and hard to grasp - solidifying an explanation using real-life examples makes it easier for pupils to understand and remember.\n\nFor example, when teaching the coastal processes of erosion and deposition, I explained these abstract terms to pupils by teaching their definitions and exploring how they are different to each other.\n\nI then developed pupils’ understanding of these abstract terms and unfamiliar vocabulary within their definitions using concrete examples, which in this case was coastal landforms. In geography, using a photograph of a coastal landform such as a wave cut notch (show image) or a spit (show image) to demonstrate what is involved in the process of erosion and deposition strengthens pupils’ understanding as it gives them a chance to apply their new knowledge of the process to a real-life example. In geography this is often thorough a case study or photograph.\n\nWhen using concrete examples, I ensure I present pupils with a wide variety to prevent them from developing a narrow understanding of the term in which misconceptions can easily arise. For example, if I only showed pupils one coastal landform where erosion had taken place, they may incorrectly think that erosion was defined only by that one coastal landform when in fact erosion can be generalised to many other landforms.\n\nAfter I explained the concept using concrete examples, I checked pupils’ understanding by presenting them with another landform and asking them whether it was created by erosion or deposition. I knew pupils understood the abstract concepts ‘erosion’ and ‘deposition’ when they were able to correctly identify it in unfamiliar examples.\n$EndContent\n$Heading\nUsing a non-example by Ashley Philipson\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nNon-examples are the opposite of <em>examples</em>. We use examples in our teaching to show a real-world example of an abstract concept we are teaching – this is a fundamental tool in many subjects. Where <em>examples</em> provide an instance of similarity, non-examples provide an instance of contrast.\n\nNon-examples are important in teaching as they are another tool which can be used to allow pupils to develop their understanding. Being able to explain why something is not a correct example is as important as knowing the correct examples.\n\nWhen I teach how coastal landforms have been created, I teach pupils about coastal landforms that have been formed through the process of erosion, <em>and</em> coastal landforms which have been formed through the process of deposition. When pupils explain how features of coastal landforms have been made, a good answer will refer to the <em>process</em> involved, rather than just a <em>sequence</em> of what happens.\n\nTo help pupils identify the difference between the two processes, I use a non-example.\n\nI might do this by saying:\n\n“a spit is a non-example of an erosional coastal feature”\n\nAnd then I might explain why to pupils or ask them to explain why to me.\n\nThis is a good non-example as some of its features are correct:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    it is a coastal feature <em>and</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>initially erosion has contributed to it</li>\n</ul>\nHowever, it has one difference:\n<ul>\n  <li>its final formation is created through deposition.</li>\n</ul>\nIf pupils can understand and explain this, it shows they have a much deeper understanding\nof the concepts of erosion and deposition. Rather than learning something just because\nwe have told them it is true, they begin to understand why and how, and then key\nconcepts begin to make sense.\n\nIn this case pupils will have a deeper understanding of more than just that one example – they understand what erosion and deposition is and the resultant features and can therefore begin to apply this knowledge when explaining the formation of landforms in new contexts.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs Ashley states, non-examples are a great way to show what something isn’t; therefore, they are an effective way of exposing potential pitfalls and explaining how to avoid them. Listen to Elizabeth Arkle talk about when she has used a non-example to develop pupils’ reasoning skills by encouraging them to identify and explain common misconceptions.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/0G7Z-WVqvnE)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nNon examples - Elizabeth Arkle at Extol Academy Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nOne point at which I have used non-examples is towards the end of a sequence of teaching, to support self-explanation in order to check and deepen understanding. Take, for example, a year 4 maths objective ‘to add and subtract up to 4 digit numbers’. Once we have worked through the small steps, and all children are able to add numbers using the column method, I have used non-examples to explore common misconceptions. Children often seem to love nothing more than finding your mistakes! Non-examples have worked well here in getting children to watch what happens, think about the mistakes, explain what I have done wrong, but then go on to explain what I should have done.\n\nWhen teaching, I will put the example on the board first in linear format for example:\n\n3456 – 798 =\n\nThis allows me to go on and set it out with place value errors which are a common mistake.\n\nI will then go on, without narration, to work through the question. It is important to note that at this point the children should be secure in the skill; this is the end of the teaching sequence and is giving them a chance to explore common misconceptions.\n\nThe class know they have to let me finish, they are not allowed to jump in and shout out any mistakes I make. Only once I have finished can children reflect on what I have done and offer an opinion.\n\nChildren will then work in their books first, putting my calculation in their books and reflecting on it. They then annotate my calculation to explain the mistakes, then complete their own calculation alongside it to correct my errors. To develop reasoning, they then come up and explain why I am right or wrong; then, if they think I am wrong, they will need to correct the example, narrating what I have done wrong. If they think I am right, then they have to work through my example to explain what I did and why it is right.\n\nChildren know they are not allowed to interrupt each other but they can offer an opinion at the end.\n\nPupils have become more articulate in explaining their methods and they are much more aware of the mistakes they can make, and are more aware of avoiding careless errors.\n\nAs a teacher, I have become much more aware of reserving time for children to think things through, then the time and space to talk through what is right or wrong. Using non-examples in this way has deepened the understanding of all pupils in my class. The fact that they are looking for my mistakes really grabs their attention as well, so they all tend to be really engaged and think deeply about the question so they can tell me if and where I have gone wrong.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Modelling\n\nModelling is an essential part of the teaching and learning process. Rosenshine (2012) found that the most effective teachers guided pupils’ practice for longer during teaching instruction, using modelling and scaffolds. This ensured pupils were confident and able to work independently later in their learning. Whereas teachers who gave less guidance to pupils during their explanations spent more time correcting individual errors because not enough time was spent ensuring pupils had a good understanding before being asked to work independently.\n\nThere are different ways you can model to support pupil understanding, but this session will focus on ‘Think Aloud’.\n\n## Using ‘Think Aloud’\n\n‘Think Aloud’ is a form of live modelling which makes the implicit process of completing a task explicit. It is when a teacher narrates their thoughts, questions or corrections as they complete an activity, so that the pupils have a clear example of how to think and what to consider when approaching a certain task. This type of modelling helps to make abstract ideas or processes concrete and accessible. It is also a good strategy to use to expose potential pitfalls to pupils and explain how to avoid them.\n\nThis process is used to demonstrate an expert’s (the teacher’s) cognition and metacognition. Using what you learnt in module two, can you answer the questions in this quick quiz?\n\n{button}[Take the quiz](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/3-what-makes-classroom-practice-effective/2-explanations-and-modelling-65-mins/module-3-session-2-quiz/){/button}\n\n## Modelling cognition and metacognition using ‘Think Aloud’\n\n### Modelling cognition\n\nIn simple terms, cognition is the thinking you do when completing a task. Teachers can model their thinking about their knowledge to demonstrate how to draw on cognitive strategies when completing a task.\n\nBelow is an example of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model their cognitive process by engaging their prior knowledge when performing a forward roll safely in PE. This has been taken from the [Metacognition and Self-regulated Learning Guidance Report](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf) (EEF, 2017):\n\n$I\nPreparing for the roll: <em>“I don’t want to hurt my neck and want to do this neatly. So first, to protect my neck, I need to tuck my chin to my chest like this.”</em>\n\nStarting the roll: <em>“Then when I start to roll, I remember not to roll onto my head. Instead, look how I’m going to roll onto my back and shoulders.”</em>\n\nCompleting the roll: <em>“This also means my back is round, so I can smoothly roll like this.”</em>\n\nChecking pupils’ understanding: <em>“Now, who can remember what I did first to protect my neck?”</em>\n$I\n\nIn this example, the teacher has broken down completing a forward roll into constituent components (outlined above) and is narrating the important points pupils need to consider at each stage. Without this narration, the pupils might not know how to break the task down or how to replicate the roll safely and successfully.\n\n### Modelling metacognition\n\nMetacognition can be broken down into three different stages:\n\n- **planning** which cognitive strategies to use\n- **monitoring** how successful the strategy is and changing it if necessary\n- **evaluating** your overall approach to improve it next time\n\nBelow is an example of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model their metacognitive processes when planning how to answer a History question:\n\n$I\n‘The main reason why the League of Nations could not stop aggression in the 1930s was because the USA was not a member. Do you agree?’\n\n<b>Planning:</b>\n\n“How am I going to approach answering this? Well firstly, I must ensure I understand the question. To do that, I am first going to read it. (teacher models reading it). Then I am going to underline key words that help me understand how I should answer the question. I can see at the end, it asks, ‘Do you agree?’, so what does that mean? It means I am going to have to give an opinion.”\n\n“What information am I going to have to include? Well, it mentions the USA not being a member as one reason for aggression, so I know I am going to have to talk about that. Would that be a good essay if I only wrote about one point? What do I know about other essays I have read or written? What makes them effective at demonstrating my opinion? Normally I have to discuss three points. I know I will talk about the USA not being a member as one point because it is cited in the question. Do I think that’s the most important point? Or do I think there are other points? What information can help me? Well, if I think back to our other lessons on this, I can recall some other points that we have covered.” Teacher asks pupils, “Which other points have we covered? Talk to your partner,” and then discusses their ideas.\n\n“So, I now have three points, I need to consider what information do I know about these. What can I do now to plan and ensure I have enough to write about? Perhaps I will write down some bullet points under each idea to prompt me to include key points in each paragraph.” (Teacher models writing down bullet points of information to include).\n\n“Now I need to consider how to structure them. Which order should I put them in? Well I know that to make my opinion clear, it would be helpful to put the strongest point at the beginning.”\n$I\n\nIn this example, the teacher has broken down planning how to approach answering an essay question into constituent components and is narrating their metacognitive thoughts to make these explicit to pupils.\n\nLater in this process, the teacher might model thought processes which demonstrate them monitoring how effective their strategy is and evaluating their strategy such as:\n\n**Monitoring:**\n\nHas my plan enabled me to answer the question effectively?\n\nIs my opinion clear enough?\n\nHave I ensured I have included enough detail in each paragraph to clearly explain my point?\n\nAm I rereading what I have written to ensure the information makes sense and links back to the question?\n\n**Evaluating:**\n\nDid my plan provide me with enough detail to include in my essay?\n\nHow could I enhance my planning to ensure I include more detail next time?\n\nWould using my notes from previous lessons help me in the planning stage?\n\nHow successful was I at staying focused on answering the question when writing my essay? What could I do next time to support me with this?\n\n## Making ‘Think Aloud’ successful\n\n### Starting narration at the point of pupil understanding\n\nWhen talking through your thinking, it is important that you consider what the pupils’ prior knowledge is. For example, if pupils have never seen a forward roll before, the teacher would need to demonstrate this first so pupils could attach the teacher’s narrated cognition to something concrete. If they don’t know what a forward roll is, the rest of the narration is less meaningful.\n\n### Focus the narration around key teaching points\n\nWhat you say is very important and should be carefully planned out. The narration should be focused around the objectives or key teaching points that you want pupils to focus on. If you narrate everything you are thinking, this could cognitively overload pupils, preventing them from following the key features you want them to learn or consider themselves.\n\n## Why is this such an important way of modelling?\n\nThe EEF (2017) highlights that modelling of this type is often not planned into explanations because the thinking processes occur ‘naturally’ to the expert (teacher), which is a **risk** because such thought processes are vital for breaking down a task so that it can be better understood or completed successfully.\n\nTo move from novice to expert, pupils need to know how an expert habitually thinks and acts (EEF, 2017). By modelling these thought processes, you make the implicit or hidden parts of a process explicit and exposed, helping to build the novice's mental model of what they should be doing in similar situations.\n\n## Which narration is most effective?\n\nTo ensure ‘Think Aloud’ is successful, you should:\n\n- Ensure narration is linked to key teaching points\n- Ensure narration considers pupils' prior knowledge\n\n$CTA\nLook at the following scripts of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model using adjectives in a sentence. Identify which one is more effective and why.\n\n<h4>Example 1:</h4>\n“I want to describe what the emperor penguin looks like.

Lots of you have given me great factual details about London but remember, our objective was looking at writing detailed descriptions and through our word choices create feelings of emotion in our readers. So today I want you to have a look back at your writing from yesterday and try and consider how you would bring your descriptions to life for your reader through the word choices you make.\n\nLet's have a look at a few examples of how you could do that. So I've taken these sentences from the model I shared with you the other day:\n\n<em>\n  ‘Matthew looked up at the sky and he saw the planes in the distance. He heard\n  the siren sound so he ran as fast as he could.’\n</em>\n\nNow I, as an author, am going to reread what I've written and consider if I could change any parts of these sentences so that I give the reader a more detailed description and try and get them to understand how the character is feeling at this moment.\n\nSo as I read what I'd written the first thing I noticed was the noun ‘sky’. ‘<em>Matthew looked up at the sky.</em>’ From what I've written I can't really identify whether it's day or night. And as we know the sky can look really different at different times of the day or with different weather so I'm going to add an adjective to help the reader to be able to picture the sky with more detail.\n\nAs lots of these raids happened at night I think I'm going to emphasize to the reader that it's night. So I've had to think of some words that I might use to describe the sky at night and you should do this too when you're thinking about different words that you could use. So I like ‘smokey’ because I think there might be still some fires around London throwing smoke into the air but then if it was smokey William wouldn't be able to see the plane, would he? So I might not use that one.\n\nI think ‘dark’ could be a good descriptive word, maybe I'll use that one, it sounds a bit scary as well doesn't it, dark and ominous. I thought pitch black would be a good word but now I look at it again, if something's pitch black you can't see anything at all so William wouldn't be able to see the plane coming, would he?\n\nI like ‘charcoal’ because charcoal is black and it would indicate that it was night but also you get charcoal from a fire and I like that it kind of reflects that London has been on fire and maybe there's still the smell of charcoal in the air. I also like clear so we can see the plane but that wouldn't help the reader understand whether it was night or day so if I use the word clear I'd have to pair it with one of the other words.\n\nSo after thinking through those words I've decided to go with charcoal because I think it describes to the reader that it is nighttime but also that it's a dark night, darker than usual as there's been fires across London that have made the air all and the sky all dirty with soot and smoke.\n\nSo my sentence now reads:\n\n<em>\n  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the planes in the distance.’\n</em>\n\nAnd the next word that catches my eye is planes. I've just put down 'and he saw the planes’. I don't really give any more detail than this to my reader and as an author I want to make sure that my language is emotive and makes the reader feel something, don't I? I want them to feel frightened of the thought of this plane coming. So the words I’ve thought of I could describe the plane are ‘enemy’, ‘intimidating’, ‘fearsome’ and ‘formidable’. All words that are indications of something powerful and dangerous coming William's way. So this time I've selected two words as I felt that I really wanted to make it clear that the planes that William was seeing weren't Allied planes, they were planes of the enemy. But I also wanted to show how William was feeling about seeing them, that he thinks they're fearsome, something that sparks the feeling of fear in him.\n\nSo the sentence now reads:\n\n<em>\n  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the fearsome enemy planes in\n  the distance.’{\" \"}\n</em>\n\nYou can hear the tone of the sentence has changed just adding those few words and now I've decided that I want to increase this feeling of fear in these sentences and I think I want to add a prepositional phrase here to make everything feel even more urgent and that everything's happening really fast.\n\nSo I've thought of the following three prepositions of time: ‘suddenly’, ‘in an instant’, ‘within moments’. Each of these indicates that something has happened quickly and will help build the tension of these sentences and that these planes will be near William imminently. I've gone with ‘within moments’ and any of these could have worked but I think that ‘suddenly’ is used quite often and I wanted something a little bit different so I’ve gone with 'within moments'.\n\nThe final description that I think I'll change is the is the phrase 'the siren sound'. I liked this initially as I added some alliteration which with an ‘s’ sound is called the ‘sibilant’ and it makes a hissing sound, 'the siren sound', which when I first wrote this I thought the siren could hiss but I want to increase the tension more for the reader by using my description so I think I will change this word to a sound that sounds more like a person who is scared. So the words I've thought of are ‘cry’, ‘wail’, ‘scream’ and ‘bellow’ which means shout loudly and all of these are sort of things that somebody would do if they were scared. And I've decided to go with ‘wail’, within moments he heard the siren ‘wail’ so he ran as fast as he could, and because a siren can't actually wail like a person, I've actually personified the siren, I've given it a human characteristic which is one of the things, the writing techniques, that we looked at the other week that helped the author describe to the reader how something might sound or might look.\n\nSo with just a few minutes of deep thinking about how I could make these two sentences more descriptive for the reader and only changing a few words I’ve now given my reader a more detailed description of the events and one that will get across more the danger of the situation and the fear of the character. So it previously read:\n\n<em>\n  ‘Matthew looked up at the sky and he saw the planes in the distance. He heard\n  the siren sound so he ran as fast as he could.’\n</em>\n\nWhich actually could be read quite positively, he could be excited to see the planes and he could be running to greet whoever is, whoever's coming off them. But the sentence written now has much more impact and is actually how i want the reader to feel when they read my writing and it reads:\n\n<em>\n  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the fearsome enemy planes in\n  the distance. Within moments he heard the siren wail so he ran as fast as he\n  could.’\n</em>\n\nAnd that's what we're aiming for with our writing. To have an impact on people in some way and with these sentences I wanted to make them feel fear and tension.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Summary\n\nExplanations and modelling are vital for building a strong foundational understanding of key knowledge or procedures in pupils. However, merely showing pupils new information or processes is not enough. Pupils need to be given the opportunity to practise new material in order to store it in their long-term memory (Rosenshine, 2012). When introducing material in small steps, pupils need to practise after each step. Providing opportunities for practise is something that will be explored in the next session.\n\n## Application of modelling\n\n$CTA\nIn your next meeting, your mentor will observe you using ‘Think Aloud’ to make your implicit thought processes explicit.\n\nThink ahead to the lesson that will be observed and spend the next 15 minutes scripting what you will say whilst using ‘Think Aloud’ to model.

Pupils need to be given the opportunity to practise new material in order to store it in their long-term memory. Rehearsal helps pupils to retrieve information easily. If pupils have had insufficient rehearsal opportunities, they are more likely to find it difficult to retrieve and use this information. This means their working memory will be consumed with recalling information, limiting the pupil’s ability to learn new information or problem solve. This can have a negative impact on both learning and motivation as it reduces pupils’ chances of achieving meaningful success.\n\nTherefore, it is important you provide multiple opportunities for pupils to practise throughout a lesson.\n\n$CTA\nListen to Claire Stoneman talk about the important of practise and answer the following questions in your notebook:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why is practice important?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why is guided practice important?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What can you provide to fuel motivation when pupils practise?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why is it important to begin to remove scaffolds?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/LzpNY1w_B3k)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nImportance of Practice - Claire Stoneman\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThis is the element of the lesson or sequence of lessons where the pupils are applying their knowledge and practising. Practising is a crucial part of learning and at any phase of schooling we need to build in opportunities for practice. Mark Enser invites us to consider the difference between practice and performance and says that in the classroom we need to consider what our pupils’ final performance will involve and then add in small steps of practice that will build towards the successful outcome.\n\nThe successful outcome might be: a piece of music performed on a recorder; a pupil using mathematical language to describe the characteristics of everyday objects; an essay about the Norman Conquest. But it's important that practice is built-in to ensure the outcome is successful.\n\nWhen you build in opportunities for practice think about chunking the practice in small steps so as not to overload the working memory. Sherrington reminds us that while the children are practising you will want to ensure that practice must be guided so that the chance of forming misconceptions is minimized. Sherrington also explains the importance of obtaining a high success rate while practising. He says <em>‘guidance is key to generating the high success rates that in turn fuels motivation and engagement during more independent work’</em>. So while the pupils are practising, scaffolds and models and worked examples are all really useful in fuelling motivation as well, contributing to high success rate. There will be a point we will begin to withdraw the scaffolds to ensure that pupils begin to use the knowledge and skills stored and built up in their long-term memory over time.\n\nSo they'll be moving from clunky and manual to smooth and automatic. But all this is also dependent on the subject, the topic you're teaching, and the elements of the topic you're teaching. There's no one-size-fits-all solution to this. You will have to think carefully through the best way for the children to practice within the subject or topic in order for them to become fluent.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs Claire highlights, practice is integral to effective teaching. Through practice, pupils consolidate their understanding of knowledge or their ability to complete a process by rephrasing, elaborating upon or summarising information (Rosenshine, 2012). Practice also gives pupils a chance to demonstrate their level of understanding, which can highlight misunderstandings. Therefore, practice has two main purposes:\n\n- It provides pupils with opportunity to consolidate their understanding before moving on to the next step in their learning\n- It provides a chance for you to pick up on misconceptions that begin to arise\n\nConsequently, pupils should have repeated opportunities to practise with appropriate guidance and support. Like the other features of effective teaching, such as explanations, modelling, and questioning, practice should be intertwined throughout the lesson and sequence of lessons. Practise should follow a teacher input where the new material has been sufficiently explained and modelled. Initial practice should be guided, and, as pupils become more proficient, pupils should transition to independent practice. Throughout any practice, it is important that pupils obtain a high success rate.\n\n## Obtain a high success rate\n\nBefore you delve into the details of guided and independent practice, it is important to consider why you should ensure pupils are successful during practice.\n\nAs Claire Stoneman mentions, one of Rosenshine’s (2012) principles is to ensure pupils obtain a high success rate during practice. This means that, during practice, it is important that pupils are getting most of their answers correct. This is pertinent in both guided and independent work for two reasons:\n\n1. Motivation - the experience of being successful at something can boost motivation\n2. Learning errors – if pupils make too many mistakes, they are practising making those errors and are more likely to embed misconceptions\n\nThe research that Rosenshine refers to found the optimal success rate during the early stages of practice was around 80%. This ensures pupils are getting many answers right whilst still being challenged, demonstrating they have learning goals ahead of their current ability. Achieving 80% success rate for every pupil in every lesson would be challenging so this can be used as a rough guide.\n\nWhen pupils are completing independent practice, success rates need to be as high as possible to avoid pupils learning errors. This is especially important if you are using homework as a form of independent practice as pupils are not likely to receive feedback whilst completing their work, making it more likely they will incorrectly learn material if they have misconceptions.\n\n### Continually evaluating pupil success\n\nYou must continually evaluate the success of your pupils so you can adapt your teaching and the level of challenge accordingly. This can be done in many ways, for example, through questioning or through circulating the classroom whilst pupils are working.\n\n_If pupil success is much lower than 80%…_\n\nThen you may need to go back and re-teach or re-explain the concept, followed by more guided practice before moving pupils onto independent practice.\n\n_If pupil success is much higher than 80%…_\n\nThen you may need to give them more of a challenge by deepening their knowledge further. You may begin by gradually reducing the level of scaffold by increasing the levels of depth of knowledge required for the task. One way to do this is through the questioning, which will be explored in the final session of this module.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Reflection</h3>\nThink about a time you had a low success rate from one or many pupils either during\nguided or independent practice and answer the following questions in your notepad.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What do you think caused the low success rate?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      When you noticed many pupils were making mistakes, what did you do?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Guided practice\n\nWhen teaching new material to pupils, their initial practice should be guided to ensure pupils obtain a high success rate.\n\nRosenshine (2012) found that more successful teachers spent longer guiding pupils’ practice through explanations and modelling than less effective teachers. In this time, they asked many questions to allow pupils to retrieve and rehearse material and check pupils’ understanding before moving onto subsequent steps. Less effective teachers spent less time on guided practice and asked pupils to move onto independent work sooner. During the independent work, the pupils who received more guided practice before completing the independent tasks were better prepared and achieved higher success in their work than those who received less guided practice. Insufficient early practice or guidance often leads to more problems arising during independent work and can have a negative impact on pupil motivation.\n\nTherefore, it is vital that you plan to include enough guided practice before moving onto independent work. A common mistake is to provide a short episode of guided practice and assume pupils are ready to begin independent practice when they aren’t. To help prevent this, you should constantly check for understanding so you can provide corrective or affirmative feedback or re-teach material where gaps remain to ensure pupils are fully prepared for independent practice. Checking for understanding will be explored in the last session of this module.\n\n## Forms of guided practice\n\nAfter pupils have been exposed to high-quality explanations and models, they can begin to be involved in the knowledge recall or procedural process. This is where pupils begin to take ownership over parts of the task with the support of the teacher as a scaffold or guide.\n\nIn Maths, this might be a teacher working out an equation and asking for pupils to suggest the next step or possible answers. In Science, this might be a teacher composing a conclusion and asking pupils to share the correct terminology or next idea of what to write. In Art, it might be a teacher painting a picture and asking pupils which colours to use and why. In Early Years, it might be a teacher modelling the formation of a letter and asking the pupils to join in by drawing it in the air. In P.E. this might be a teacher modelling, with narration, how to attack in a three vs two and asking for pupil suggestions of what to do next and why.\n\nDuring this time, it is important that you give feedback on pupils’ answers or ideas and address any misconceptions that arise.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3\n  class=\"rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write heading…\"\n>\n  What does guided practice look like?\n</h3>\nWatch one of the videos below to see how a teacher uses guided practice to build\npupils’ independence and answer the following questions:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How do they scaffold pupils’ responses?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How do they ensure all pupils are thinking, even if only to share their\n      ideas with the class?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/grrqvBA9lDg)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nForms of guided practice – Early Years at Reach Academy\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/EjejRnXwd4o)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nForms of guided practice – Primary at Reach Academy\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/dbJhvKLRK5w)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nForms of guided practice – Secondary at Reach Academy\n\n## Supporting writing through guided practice\n\nIn their guidance report, the EEF (2019) emphasise the importance for literacy skills to be taught in all subjects and disciplines where possible as research has found that there are links between pupils’ literacy skills and their performance in GCSEs across many subjects, not just English.\n\nReading, writing, and comprehension feature in all subjects in some way. Therefore, it is essential that all teachers strive to support and develop pupils’ literacy skills where possible and one way to do this is through guiding pupils during the writing, also known as Shared Writing.\n\n## Shared writing\n\nThis can be used on any occasion where pupils are being asked to compose a written response, which will occur in almost every subject. Supporting pupils with their writing across the curriculum provides them with more opportunities to practice and receive feedback which will support writing development.\n\nShared writing is a form of guided practice where a teacher writes with and in front of pupils to develop their ability to write independently (Corbett, 2015). When doing this, teachers can use a variety of modelling strategies, including ‘Think Aloud’, to make the implicit thought process of an expert writer explicit to novice learners.\n\n$I\nSome general principles of shared writing are:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Generate writing based on pupils’ ideas they share.</li>\n  <li>\n    Remind, prompt and challenge pupils so the writing remains focused on the\n    skills and vocabulary being developed.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Model good writing skills such as rereading the text and listening to the\n    flow of composition so the next sentence can be composed.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Keep the pace brisk to ensure pupils don’t lose focus but include pauses for\n    ‘thinking time’.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nShared writing is the guided phase used to develop pupil independence in writing. It engages the whole class during teaching instruction but can also be used as a support to groups of pupils during writing tasks.\n\nIn a sequence, it would come after teacher input, where a teacher models writing without pupil input using ‘Think Aloud’, but before independent practice, where pupils are asked to work without adult support.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Shared writing in the classroom</h3>\nWatch the video below to see a teacher using shared writing and answer the following\nquestions in your notepad:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What prior knowledge would pupils need in order to contribute during\n      shared writing?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What was the impact of shared writing on pupils’ engagement and learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How did the teacher maintain high expectations or address misconceptions?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/wR38LtjSQG0)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nShared writing – Primary at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Shared writing – Primary at Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/-wcQo6XpEus)\n\n## Summary\n\nGuided practice is essential as it provides opportunities for pupils to consolidate their learning, helping them to retrieve material from their long-term memory, whilst simultaneously providing an insight into their level of understanding and highlighting any misconceptions they may have.\n\nBefore pupils move onto guided practice, they need an appropriate level of knowledge which should be developed during explanations and modelling, prior to guided practice.\n\nDuring guided practice, it is likely you will still include elements of modelling and explanation to clarify understanding and build upon pupils’ learning. Therefore, explanations and modelling cannot be separated from guided practice as they are heavily intertwined.\n\nPupils' level of understanding during guided practice should be continually reviewed through questioning (explored in the last session of this module). This will inform you of how to progress the lesson. If pupils demonstrate a low success rate during guided practice, then you may need to return to the explanations and models you exposed them to when first introducing the material and provide more examples to build up their understanding and address gaps in learning.\n\nEqually, if pupils are very confident during guided practice, you may need to reduce the level of support or guidance you are providing.\n\n## Application to practice\n\n$CTA\nIdentify a lesson you will teach in the next week and plan to include guided practice.

  ["d5872c32-ab69-4627-b6be-25ef7a7856d0", "Lesson content", "This session will take **approximately 60 minutes** to complete.\n\n## Session overview\n\nIndependent practice is a vital part of effective teaching as this is where pupils can consolidate their learning. There are many things to consider when planning effective independent practice.\n\nTo support you to do this, this session will explore:\n\n- Why is independent practice important?\n- Planning the right practice activity\n- Providing further guides and scaffolds\n- Using collaborative practice to best effect\n- Gradually removing scaffolding\n\n## Why is independent practice important?\n\nIndependent practice can arbitrarily be viewed as the third phase of learning. It is where pupils practise new material without support from adults, and eventually, resources. Rosenshine (2012) recognises independent practice as a vital part of learning because it provides pupils with the much-required opportunity to complete a procedure or activity over and over. He identifies ‘overlearning’ as necessary for pupils to become fluent or automatic in a skill. When pupils become automatic in a process or skill, they free up their working memory which can be used to apply their learning to new contexts.\n\nThe more pupils practise the material, the stronger the retrieval strength becomes. Without enough independent practice, pupils will find it more challenging to recall information or procedures at a later stage as the retrieval strength of the new material won’t be as strong.\n\n## Planning the right practice activity\n\nDuring independent practice, pupils should work on the same material covered during guided practice to give them an opportunity to consolidate their learning.\n\nFor example, if you covered finding the area of rectangular shapes during guided practice, then that’s what pupils should focus on during independent practice. It would be inappropriate to ask them to find the area of compound shapes as the strategy for doing so is different. Pupils would need to see this being modelled and engage in guided practice before working on this independently, otherwise you are likely to obtain a low success rate from many pupils and need to reteach the material. Therefore, it is vital you carefully plan both the guided and independent practice, so they focus on practising the same material.\n\nIndependent practice should be planned to ensure pupils think hard about the material they have covered during guided practice. This seems straightforward and obvious but can be more challenging than it might appear.\n\nSometimes, you may think you are planning activities that provide opportunities for pupils to practise or demonstrate the knowledge that you have been developing, but this may not always be the case. In order to complete an activity successfully, pupils need to have all the knowledge required. However, certain aspects can be overlooked when planning independent practice for pupils.\n\nAn example of this could be pupils writing a newspaper article to demonstrate or practice their knowledge of a topic (Enser, 2019). Unless they have been taught how to write a newspaper article – how to generate a catchy title, how to write in columns, or how to use direct and indirect quotes – then they won’t get the opportunity to practise what you intended. Because of the limitations on working memory, they will be consumed with the features of a newspaper article, instead of demonstrating or practising their knowledge of a topic. If, however, the pupils have already mastered the writing components of a newspaper article, then this could be a suitable way for them to present the material they are learning about. It is important that pupils have the relevant domain-specific knowledge before being asked to apply their knowledge or think critically.\n\nTherefore, it is important you spend time carefully planning activities that provide pupils with the opportunity to practise or demonstrate their learning, taking into consideration any additional foundational knowledge they may require.\n\n## Which activity is the most appropriate?\n\nIt is important to ensure the independent practice enables pupils to practise the new material you have taught them. Take a look at the scenario below and select the activity you think is the most appropriate.\n\n### Scenario\n\nThe focus of the lesson is for pupils to shade 3D objects to show light and shadow. You begin the lesson by explaining how you can shade objects to show light and shadow. You use ‘Think Aloud’ to demonstrate your thought processes whilst modelling shading 3D compound shapes with light coming from one direction per shape. You then complete guided practice where you invite pupils to tell you which areas to shade darker and which areas to shade lighter and why. You then ask them to have a quick practice at their tables on a similar shape, addressing any misconceptions that you identify. You then decide pupils are ready to complete some extended independent practice.\n\n### Which activity would you give them?\n\n{button}[Take the quiz](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/3-what-makes-classroom-practice-effective/4-independent-practice-60-mins/module-3-session-4-which-activity-would-you-give-them-quiz/){/button}\n\nWhen starting pupils off on a task, it is also important to check they understand what to do before they begin. This helps to ensure they can begin immediately. There are a number of ways you can do this, but one way is to ask pupils to repeat instructions back to you before setting them off.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink about an activity you recently set. Consider the following questions and record\nyour response in your notepad.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How successful were pupils at this activity and why do you think that was?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Is there anything you would do differently next time?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Providing further guides and scaffolds\n\nThroughout a lesson, you will provide pupils with a large amount of scaffolding and support. This will firstly occur during your explanations and modelling and continue during guided practice. This helps to ensure pupils develop a strong understanding of the material you are teaching them.\n\nWhen first setting up independent practice, you may need to continue to provide scaffolds to ensure pupils achieve a high level of success. These scaffolds will guide pupils through cognitive and metacognitive processes, which will help to break the tasks down into its constituent components without the direct input from a teacher. Before you explore different ways to do this, let’s recap what cognition and metacognition are.\n\n### Cognition:\n\nThis is the thinking. It’s the thought processes involved in applying a cognitive strategy or approach to solving a problem or completing a task. For example, using long addition to find the sum of two numbers, or using a mnemonic to help you memorise a spelling.\n\n### Metacognition:\n\nThis is the knowledge that pupils have about:\n\n- the task they have been given\n- the cognitive strategies they could use\n- their own abilities\n\nPupils apply this knowledge when completing a task. This knowledge can be applied at three main stages. When:\n\n- **Planning** how to tackle a problem or complete an activity\n- **Monitoring** how successful their approach is at solving the problem or completing an activity and adapting it if necessary\n- **Evaluating** how successful they were at solving the problem or completing the task once it’s complete\n\nDuring guided practice, you should model both cognitive and metacognitive strategies by using ‘Think Aloud’ as you demonstrate, but pupils may still benefit from prompts that help to break tasks down into constituent components without your direct guidance or support. This can be done in a variety of ways, some of which you have already explored:\n\n- You might provide pupils with **worked examples** to use as a point of reference when completing independent work to demonstrate the cognitive strategy or approach\n- You might provide pupils with **partially completed** examples to focus their thinking around the part of a cognitive strategy or approach you want to develop\n- You might provide pupils with a** checklist** to prompt cognitive and metacognitive thoughts\n\nAs you have previously explored worked examples and partially completed examples in module two, this section will focus on using checklists.\n\n## Checklists to scaffold cognitive processes\n\nUsing checklists can be an effective way to scaffold pupils’ cognition by ensuring they remain focused around the success criteria of a task.\n\nThis can help to break the task down into its constituent components and prompt students’ thinking during independent practice. The following examples demonstrate how this might look in different contexts:\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Literacy example:</h3>\nIf the independent practice requires pupils to describe a character using metaphors\nand similes, the checklist might consist of the following:\n\nHave I grouped my ideas into clear paragraphs?\n\nHave I used a simile effectively using like or as? e.g. His smile is like a ray of sunshine. His smile is as radiant as the sun.\n\nHave I used a metaphor effectively? E.g. Pools of blue and hazel stare steadily into the distance.\n\nHave I re-read my work to check it makes sense?\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Science example:</h3>\nIf independent practice is to balance chemical equations, the checklist might be:\n\nHave I replaced the name of each substance with its symbol or formula?\n\nHave I checked whether the equation is balanced?\n\nIf the equation is not balanced, have I used numbers to balance it?\n$I\n\nIf you are in a setting where pupils can’t read yet, such as Early Years, you can use images as a visual prompt.\n\nProviding pupils with a checklist for cognitive strategies acts as a scaffold to ensure that pupils remain focused on the key learning points. They help to break down the task into its parts and prompt pupils to consider their next steps.\n\nThese questions should be modelled by you during guided practice using ‘Think Aloud’ but displaying or giving pupils a checklist during independent practice can support pupils to take ownership over their learning as they are required to monitor and check their work.\n\n$CTA\nListen to Elizabeth Arkle talk about how she uses checklists to scaffold pupils during independent practice.\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/8cglwtNb7Yw)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nChecklists – Elizabeth Arkle at Extol Academy Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This year in English, I really wanted to make children’s planning of their\n  writing more meaningful and something that they actually used. I noticed that\n  all too often children would plan a piece of writing through a sequence of\n  lessons but then almost abandon the plan and just try and write from memory.\n  They would frequently go and get a SPAG checklist, or a year group assessment\n  grid, and then write something that was often poorly organised and did not\n  meet the purpose for the writing.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I wanted to give children a way to plan ideas for vocabulary and sentence\n  structure, but also see clearly what should be in their writing so I decided\n  to use a checklist to act as a prompt. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Before a piece of writing, I plan a checklist, together with the children,\n  that is specific to that piece of writing. We call it ‘ingredients for\n  success’. As it is developed{\" \"}\n</span>\n<i>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with </span>\n</i>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  the children, not just given to them, they take it very seriously. I always\n  start the process off by adding some non-negotiables – these will be my\n  specific aims for this piece of writing. For example, it might be to include\n  speech, or to focus children on expanded noun phrases for description. From\n  there the children will start to offer what they think should be included and\n  we develop this together. Lastly, if they have been given a next step target\n  from their last writing – for example, to remember commas in a list – they\n  will add this to their own. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  What we include in the checklist varies from piece to piece, but means we have\n  a very specific and relevant checklist to guide children through their\n  writing. Pupils are encouraged to physically tick things off on their list as\n  they go to keep them on track.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It also gives me the chance to give my children writing at greater depth a\n  further challenge by adding other elements to their work. Similarly, I can\n  remove elements from some children’s checklists to help keep them focused on\n  the skills they need to work on.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Planning writing in this way has really helped children to develop\n  independence in their writing. It did need a conscious investment of time at\n  the outset. To begin with, children would sometimes come up with simple\n  punctuation points. Now, however, they are beginning to think for themselves\n  about what makes a good piece of writing and will make much more thoughtful\n  contributions, such as starting sentences in different ways. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  One other advantage of these more specific checklists is I can add specific\n  targets for individual children very easily. For example, one child – although\n  a good writer – was persistently using ‘and then’ in their writing. By adding\n  this to their checklist, over a couple of pieces of writing, they have almost\n  completely stopped doing this.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I have found checklists to be a vital resource when building pupil\n  independence whilst still providing a form of scaffold.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n## Checklists to scaffold metacognitive processes\n\nUsing a checklist can also be used to scaffold pupils’ metacognition during a task, which supports them to self-regulate their learning.\n\nHere, checklists would include questions to support them during the planning, monitoring and evaluation phases of the work they are doing.\n\nBelow is an example of some questions you might use if the independent practice required pupils to complete a self-portrait. This example has been taken from[ Metacognition and self-regulated learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf) (EEF, 2018).\n\n### Questions during planning:\n\n- ‘What resources do I need to carry out a self-portrait?’\n- ‘Have I done a self-portrait before and was it successful?’\n- ‘What have I learned from the examples we looked at earlier?’\n- ‘Where do I start and what viewpoint will I use?’\n- ‘Do I need a line guide to keep my features in proportion?’\n\n### Questions during monitoring:\n\n- ‘Am I doing well?’\n- ‘Do I need any different techniques to improve my self-portrait?’\n- ‘Are all of my facial features in proportion?’\n- ’Am I finding this challenging?’\n- ‘Is there anything I need to stop and change to improve my self-portrait?’\n\n### Questions during evaluation:\n\n- ‘How did I do?’\n- ‘Did my line guide strategy work?’\n- ‘Was it the right viewpoint to choose?’\n- ‘How would I do a better self-portrait next time?’\n- ‘Are there other perspectives, viewpoints or techniques I would like to try?’\n\nDisplaying a checklist containing metacognitive prompts during independent practice supports pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their progress whilst they work without teacher guidance. This helps to build their metacognitive strategies and reminds them of the thought process that an expert would go through.\n\n## Using collaborative practice to best effect\n\nRosenshine (2012, page 16) states that “an important finding from information-processing research is that students need to spend additional time rephrasing, elaborating and summarising new material in order to store this material in their long-term memory”. This suggests that discussion can be a powerful form of practice, and collaboration with peers presents opportunities for this to occur. Research shows that paired or group activities can increase pupil success (EEF, 2018), but what can you do to ensure it is effective?\n\n### What makes effective collaboration?\n\nThere are some key features that can support effective collaboration:\n\n- **Practice** – key skills of listening and responding need to be taught when asking pupils to talk to their partner or work as a group (EEF, 2018). Pupils will not inherently know how to do this well. Therefore, you need to decide how you want pupils to work collaboratively and support pupils to do so effectively through clear instructions and practice.\n- **Structured tasks** – tasks that are well structured and promote talk and interaction tend to have the greatest impact (EEF, 2018).\n- **Prior knowledge** – as with any practice task, when working collaboratively, pupils must have all the knowledge they require in order to complete the task successfully (Enser, 2019).\n- **Groupings** – it is important that you carefully select pupils who will work together well.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Collaborative practice in action</h3>\nWatch one of the videos below to see how collaboration can be used as a form of pupil\npractice and consider the following questions.

Effective collaboration can support pupils to develop their understanding of a concept or topic as it provides pupils with an opportunity to hear and evaluate ideas that might be different to their own.\n\nOne example of when I used collaboration was when my class were looking at ‘Who was to blame for the death of Bess?’ in the text The Highwayman in year 6.\n\nIn order to set the ground rules for the lesson I ensured that I had gone over the talk rules and expectations for this lesson. At the time our main focus was to wait for a break in order to give our opinion so that we were not interrupting. My pupils were not used to this, so this was an aspirational and challenging target. Prior to the lesson, I prepared pupils through circle time where we explored appropriate behaviours when discussing a topic, such as waiting for an appropriate gap to speak and listening carefully in order to build on to a point or disagree respectfully.\n\nThe children worked in groups of 4 and each was assigned a role.  The group leader directed the conversation and ensured that all children were involved. The scribe participated in the discussion and recorded notes. The group member took part in the discussion and ensured that they were challenging the views of others if they didn’t agree. The reporter shared the group’s ideas with the rest of the class.  I find that groups of 4 are ideal as pupils have a shoulder partner (someone who is sitting next to them) and a face partner (someone who is sitting opposite them) so it makes it easier for them share and communicate their ideas and ensure all pupils’ voices are heard. The pupils had been using this structure for group work for about 4 weeks and were now using it well.\n\nPrior learning of the group roles included group role cards to show the children what their expectations were in that role. I had created a video of a group of children executing the roles well from the previous year. This gave the children a good example of what this should look like. We also used the roles regularly in any talk-focused scenario so that they began to build up their confidence in their role.\n\nTo ensure all pupils could meaningfully engage in the discussion, I ensured that the children had a clear understanding of the text that we were looking at. This had been a journey over 3-4 weeks in the build-up of work and unpicking of the text. I also ensured that they had a clear view of the characters throughout the text and we had built up character profiles by using ‘role on the wall’ for each character on the working wall that they could then draw upon to base their opinions around.\n\nIn order to support the children further, I then used the Tower Hamlets progression in Language Structures to create persuasive talk frames.  The children then built their opinions from evidence in the text and used the talk frames to convey these. At the same time, they practised waiting for the gap and using the talk rules that were the focus for that lesson. This enabled the children to have an in-depth conversation with high-quality language and structure for support.\n\nMy role throughout was to listen to the children’s ideas and prompt their thinking when necessary to scaffold or extend their learning. For instance, one group thought they had come to a collective decision and all agreed straight away on who they believed was to blame. I then asked some questions to encourage further reflection and deeper thinking, which instigated a new line of enquiry.\n\nCollaborative learning is something that I ensure is at the heart of every lesson within my class. I group pupils of mixed attainment into groups of four. I always remind children of our talk rules before we begin to discuss our thoughts. This ensures the children are aware of the expectations when discussing their opinions and can do this respectfully.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/FLh9aUDlnsw)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nUsing groups of four for collaborative learning - Robert Gardner at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nCollaborative learning can be a very productive learning activity for students. However, there is a caveat: it has to be very carefully planned and structured, with very clear timings and very clear stages to the activity, or very clear roles for students who are taking part. Students also have to be very much prepared for the task in terms of their prior knowledge of the topic, if you want them to be successful and successfully engage with the collaborative activity.\n\nThere are lots of different ways to set up collaborative activities. I would use something called a Kagan structure in my classroom. Generally two or four students take part in that. I would never really have larger group sizes than four but that is possible obviously.\n\nThese collaborative structures have very clear stages and instructions; students work collaboratively towards a common goal. They all have to take part to achieve that goal, but they are doing this in a framework that is very much directed by the teacher in terms of the timing and moving through each stage of the activity.\n\nOne example of this is a <em>consensus activity</em> where students aim towards reaching consensus. So, students are given a question or a debating point that they work on alone before they share their ideas together, and then they discuss those ideas with the group at large, with the whole class at large. So for example, with a recent year 10 class, we were working on <em>Macbeth </em>and I posed the question or the debating point: “Macbeth is a wholly evil character. Discuss”. First the students were asked to work independently, they didn't communicate with their group colleagues at all at first. They had to think about their key ideas, their initial thoughts, maybe some evidence in response to that question of Macbeth being wholly evil. Once they've had that time, which is important, that prior knowledge, activating that prior knowledge was important, once that time was up, I signalled for them to get together in their groups and each of them took turns to share their ideas. Again, that was very much controlled by me through timings. The aim was to stimulate some debate but also to look at any similarities that students might have once they had shared their ideas, in order that they could craft a group consensus in response to that debating point on <em>Macbeth</em>. When directed, someone from each group acted as a spokesman and they shared their ideas with the class at large, so we had a whole class discussion after the collaborative activity.\n\nThe features of this task that made it successful were:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Every student had a clear role to play</li>\n  <li>\n    The task was very structured in terms of timings and when we are moving\n    through each stage\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Students had enough prior knowledge to be able to succesfully engage with\n    the task\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    And they were given that little bit of individual time at the very beginning\n    of the task just in order to think about that prior knowledge, to kind of\n    reactivate that prior knowledge, I suppose, before the group consensus\n  </li>\n</ul>\nWe could contrast that very structured approach with something I've done in the past\nwhich wasn't successful. I would pose a question to a group, so \"discuss this in\ngroups\" I would say after I'd given them a topic area. Now, that didn't give them\nany struture at all. And I have done this before in the past, I'll hold my hands\nup. The students lacked direction; some students did nothing; some students dominate\nthe conversation. They weren't given time to think about prior knowledge, to activate\nthat prior knowledge, to formulate their ideas. So this task, when I've done that\nin the past, were unsuccessful, a lot of students didn't benefit from that.\n\nThere are lots of different ways you can actually group students. I would tend to group students in terms of ability, but you can have mixed ability groups, based on their prior attainment for instance. You should always bear in mind, whenever you are putting groups together, potential pastoral or behavioural concerns within the group, that is very, very important, those things that could manifest when students are working together.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/RLjjNDwUJhc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nUsing multiple groupings during collaboration - Joseph Craven at Northern Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nGroup work can serve a really useful function. It builds on and can help to develop pupils’ confidence, as well as ensuring effective preparatory thinking and planning before any high-stakes questioning or writing.\n\nI use collaborative work frequently but one example of when I have done this is during a year 11 English Literature revision lesson when we were exploring a key question related to the text <em>A Christmas Carol</em>: ‘How is Scrooge presented at the beginning of the novel?’\n\nThe pupils were already sitting in mixed attainment groups of four and each had a number 1-4. I started with a ‘Think-Pair-Share' activity so that pupils had time to individually reflect on the question. I gave them 30 seconds to think and then one minute to write down their own ideas.  I then gave them two minutes to discuss their ideas with a partner who was sitting next to them.  I then gave them a further four minutes to share their ideas with a partner sitting opposite them, which would then lead to a group discussion where they would hopefully come to a consensus for the answer to that question.\n\nI then wanted the class to explore how Scrooge is presented throughout the whole text. I asked pupils numbered 1 to focus stave (or chapter) 2, pupils numbered 2, to focus on stave 3, pupils numbered 3 to focus on stave 4 and pupils numbered 4 to focus on stave 5. I asked pupils work independently for 2 minutes to bullet point ideas about the presentation of Scrooge in their stave. After that, I asked the Number 1s to move to a designated table at the back of the room, the Number 2s to a table in the middle, the Number 3s to a table also in the middle, and the Number 4s to a table at the front. I always ensure pupils make this transition quickly and quietly so that it doesn’t waste learning time. As pupils have become more familiar with this transition, the routine has become quicker and more efficient.\n\nIn their new groups, I gave pupils 5 minutes to share ideas, to pass around their bullet points, to add to their lists and so on. When they are doing this, I circulate the room to support, stretch groups and individual pupils where necessary, focusing on those who require the most support.\n\nWhen the timer finishes, pupils move back to their original groups and have one minute each to share their notes with the rest of the group. During this phase, it’s quite normal and quite lovely to hear praise, applause and other positive modes of feedback that the pupils give to each other. After this, I took whole-class feedback by asking individuals to share their points and we discussed these as a class.\n\nI find collaboration a great way to scaffold pupils' learning and have noticed it works best when tasks are well structured, when pupils are familiar with any routines involved and when pupils have the prior knowledge required to meaningfully engage with the tasks set.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Gradually removing scaffolding\n\nWhilst it is important to provide scaffolds when first setting up independent practice, it is important that you remove those scaffolds over time to increase the challenge and ensure pupils develop complete independence.\n\nChoose one of the videos below to listen as a teacher talks through an example of how they removed scaffolding over time to increase pupil independence.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/2jj9tcpqDok)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nRemoving scaffolding in Primary maths - Debra Ridley at Extol Academy Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWhen revising multiplying and dividing by 10, 100 and 1000, I noticed that a small group of pupils were still struggling to grasp this concept, particularly when decimals were involved. The scaffold I used was a number slider so that when working out a calculation, the pupils could use the scaffold to see what was actually happening to the place value of the digits when being multiplied or divided.\n\nThis is the scaffold I used (<strong>presenter shows number slider</strong>).\n\nWhile the pupils were using the slider, I asked them questions to check and deepen their understanding, such as: what has happened to the value of the numbers? Which direction are they moving in? How many places do they need to move and how do you know? These questions helped to scaffold pupils learning by breaking down the process into small components so they could understand each step.\n\nAfter they had used the slider, I asked the pupils to record the calculation in their books and then write the answer directly underneath it. Their answer was then represented in the squares on the page as well as on the slider. It was at this point I asked them to look at the squares in their maths books and we discussed how the movement of the digits could also be represented by the squares.\n\nBy transitioning from the concrete tool – the slider – to the use of the squares in a maths book, I reduced the level of scaffold given to pupils. Using squares in the maths book made pupils think harder about the direction the numbers should move and by how many places they should be moved because they no longer had the concrete resource to rely on.\n\nIt’s important that scaffolds like this are eventually removed entirely, as pupils need to be able to answer questions like this independently, to ensure they fully master the concept and skill.\n\nAfter independent practice, the pupils were able to be confident in multiplying and dividing by 10, 100 and 1000 without a concrete resource. They now use the squares in their maths books as a guide if they need to and, when doing this without squared paper, they know they can quickly draw a grid, like this one <strong>(show an example of the grid)</strong> if necessary, to help them ‘move’ the digits. The use of a concrete tool transitioned to a mental strategy that pupils can draw upon when needed.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/KW6Z6yoW9wY)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nRemoving scaffolding in Secondary MFL - Joanna Macaulay at Northern Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nBoth within a lesson and throughout a series of lessons, it is important that there is a logical progression. This often takes the form of initially presenting new information through explanations and models, then practicing new material and skills in a collaborative way, before providing pupils time for independent work. Throughout this process scaffolding should be provided and then eventually removed as pupils’ knowledge develops and they require a greater level of challenge. To support pupils to be successful in their work, I try to be consistent in the strategies and structures I use to explain key concepts. I find this helps to build pupils' confidence and consequently increase their levels of motivation.\n\nWhen teaching pupils how to write in French I break it down into its components parts by first teaching them the key structures that build a basic sentence, then how to extend a simple sentence, and finally how to construct paragraphs and extended pieces of writing.\n\nWhen teaching these components, I initially provide pupils with a scaffold to support their practice. These scaffolds might be writing frames to support with sentence structure or vocabulary prompts to support with translation. Pupils can use the vocabulary prompts to change key components in the writing frame, such as using different adjectives, verbs, connectives and opinions.\n\nThen, during guided and independent practice, pupils use these writing frames and vocabulary prompts to support them to construct their own sentences whilst following the correct grammatical structures.\n\nOver time, I reduce the level of support provided in the writing frame by removing the amount of words or structures given, and I then challenge pupils to recall the structures from their memory which helps to build their learning and independence until eventually they no longer require writing structures to support them.\n\nWhat is important to note in this example is that the principle of progression from formulating basic sentences to extending sentences into paragraphs remains the same. Once these structures are stored in the pupil's long-term memory, they can recall them and draw upon them when learning about new topics or vocabulary. Using the same writing frames and structures each time supports all pupils, particularly those who are lower attaining in French, as it allows for increased practice and therefore increased success.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/a0agtunwZCM)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nRemoving scaffolding in Secondary history - Alex Fairlamb at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nOne example of when I used scaffolding and then gradually removed it was when I tasked my pupils with answering a source utility question. This is one of the more complex History skills as it requires pupils to study sources and determine how useful they are for a given enquiry by evaluating both their content and source. Therefore, I scaffolded learning by first modelling how to approach answering a question like this and then gradually removed this scaffold throughout the lesson.\n\nTo begin with, I broke down the question for them into its component parts by using a technique called ‘RUSS the question’ – ‘Read it, underline it, summarise it, then solve it.’  I then began to use ‘Think Aloud’ to model unpacking what the question is asking. For example, by saying “What does ‘How’ mean – I know from previous lessons that it means you’re required to give a judgement.”\n\nI then began to model how to structure the response.  First of all, I modelled checking the question and mapping out where the different components would appear in my answer by saying things like:\n\n“What are the key words in the question?  What do those key words mean and what therefore is the question asking me to do?  I’m going to now summarise the question by making a checklist for this question so that I can ensure that I have included everything that it is asking of me – I must include: three paragraphs, evidence from my own knowledge, and I must include explanation.\"\n\nAfter this, I began to model completing the task, demonstrating my metacognition by thinking aloud about what I was doing, how and why.  During this stage of the lesson, I began to remove scaffolding and support by asking pupils to contribute as I modelled completing the task. This enabled me to guide and support their responses. Once I felt pupils were secure in their understanding of how to answer this question, I tasked pupils with independent practice.\n\nFor the independent practice, I provided pupils with a partially completed example to continue to scaffold their responses. This further reinforced their understanding of the different elements of the question and ensured their thinking was focused around the key learning points.\n\nSo throughout the lesson, I gradually removed the scaffold of teacher support to increase pupil independence. During independent practise, pupils were not expected to work entirely without scaffolds and instead were given a partially completed example because I knew they would require some form of support. However, over time, depending on the pupil and their progress, I began to remove scaffolds for source utility questions. I began by transitioning from a partially completed example to using checklists to support and prompt pupils' cognitive and metacognitive processes. Once pupils had internalised the structure and processes involved in the question, I was able to remove the checklists entirely. The speed at which this was done varied for different pupils to suit their differing needs. To further support pupil independence, I ensure I consistently use the same structures when answering questions.\n\nI always challenge pupils to progress to independence – the scaffolding must begin to come down at some point, but when appropriate. Don’t be fearful to put scaffolds back into place if errors are made and it is required.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nThe level of scaffold and the length of time you provide pupils with will depend on the task and the pupil’s current understanding. Therefore, it will most likely look different for different pupils. This will be explored further in module five.\n\n## Application\n\n$CTA\nGuided and independent practice will be observed in your next mentor meeting.

It can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate learning and extend their vocabulary. This is supported by Rosenshine (2012) as he found that the most effective teachers spent more than half of the class time explaining, modelling and asking questions. Questioning is a vital teacher tool for two main reasons (Rosenshine, 2012):\n\n- It enables you to assess pupils’ understanding to determine whether there is a need for additional instruction\n- It enables you to provide pupils the opportunity to practise what is being taught to consolidate and extend learning\n\n$CTA\nIn this section, you will explore how questioning can be used to check for pupil understanding and build learning. Start by listening to Claire Stoneman talk about using questioning as part of effective classroom practice and answer the questions in your notepad:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>When might you use questioning in a lesson?</li>\n  <li>\n    What are Sherrington’s (2019) ‘relevant instructional procedures’ of\n    questioning?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    How do you think questioning links to effective explanations and modelling?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/SvRXqL3G7Fw)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nThe importance of questioning - Claire Stoneman\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nMuijs and Reynolds tell us that due to its importance, questioning is one of the most widely studied elements in teaching research. Questioning is a crucial element of effective instruction and can be used throughout the lesson. For example, it may be used during retrieval practice, which might occur at the beginning of a lesson. Questioning can also be used during an explanation or during modelling to gauge whether information has been understood. Questioning is a vital and flexible tool at any part of a lesson.\n\nQuestioning is essential to great teaching and should be interactive and responsive. Sherrington provides what he calls the ‘Relevant instructional procedures of questioning’. They are:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Ask a large number of questions and check for understanding</li>\n  <li>Ask students to explain what they have learned</li>\n  <li>Check the response of all students</li>\n  <li>Provide systematic feedback and corrections</li>\n</ol>\nSo questioning helps us do a lot. It's essential to be a good questioner as a teacher\nand again it needs lots and lots of practice. Our questions can help us gauge many\nthings, from how well the pupils understand, to whether we need to reteach something,\nto whether pupils have understood a complex concept. We need to ask loads of questions\nand involve loads of pupils. We may need to take more time in a lesson to explain\nsomething further if our questioning has shown us that pupils don't really get it.\nQuestioning enables us to be responsive teachers and to act on the information we\nglean from our pupils. Questioning is really key and, as Rosenshine found, less successful\nteachers ask fewer questions and almost no process questions. There's an array of\nquestioning strategies that you can employ in your teaching. It's worth focusing\non a few and practicing them until you're more comfortable and they come more naturally.\nPractice is key.\n\nIn this session you'll explore how to check pupils’ understanding by asking pupils a number of different questions and gaining feedback about what they understand. As Rosenshine and Sherrington emphasize, this reinforces the need to present material in small steps. If there's too much at once then errors and misconceptions will potentially occur more frequently. Therefore chunked explanations supported by models and reinforced by regular questioning and checking for understanding is vital.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Questioning to assess understanding\n\nAssessing understanding is an essential part of teaching as it gives you an insight about the level of knowledge pupils have. It should be used throughout explanations to check whether you need to re-teach the step you have just introduced or move onto the next.\n\nAssessing understanding can be challenging to get right. In order to appreciate how to check for understanding effectively, it is helpful to consider what constitutes poor practice to highlight strategies to avoid. Rosenshine (1982), cited in Rosenshine’s Principles in Action (2019, page 31) highlights that the wrong way to check for understanding is:\n\n> “…to ask only a few questions, call on volunteers to hear their (usually correct) answers, and then assume that all of the class either understands or has now learned from hearing the volunteers’ responses. Another error is to ask, ‘Are there any questions?’ and, if there aren’t any, assume that everybody understands. Another error is to assume that it is not necessary to check for understanding, and simply repeating the points will be sufficient.”\n>\n> Rosenshine (2019)\n\nChecking for, and building, understanding through questioning is a vital process that should occur continuously throughout the lesson. Below are some key features of checking for understanding that should be incorporated into your questioning, which will be explored in this session:\n\n- Avoid self-report questions - ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught\n- Check whole class understanding\n- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response\n\n## Avoid self-report questions\n\nSelf-report questions are generally the rhetorical questions which ask pupils to tell you whether they understand or not, such as:\n\n“Is everyone clear on…?” or “Does that make sense…?”\n\nThese are the types of questions that Rosenshine recommends you avoid asking because such rhetorical questions typically generate a passive “yes” response and do not inform you about what they have understood or any misconceptions they may have developed.\n\nPupils are likely to give a passive response for a number of possible reasons:\n\n- Embarrassment – pupils are less likely to stop the teaching to say they don’t understand\n- Pupils aren’t aware of what they don’t know – because pupils are novices in the topic you are teaching, they are unlikely to be aware of misconceptions or inaccurate knowledge they may be developing\n- Pupils might find it hard to reflect on the question of whether they have understood something\n\nTo avoid asking rhetorical questions that don’t give accurate detail about pupil understanding, you should ask carefully chosen questions that are directly linked to the material you are teaching.\n\n{button}[Take the quiz](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/3-what-makes-classroom-practice-effective/5-questioning-60-mins/module-3-session-5-self-report-questions/){/button}\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nHave you asked pupils a self-report question in a recent lesson?\n\nIf so, consider the following questions and record your answer in your notepad:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What was the pupils’ response?</li>\n  <li>Did it help you to check pupil understanding accurately?</li>\n  <li>\n    What could you have asked instead that would be a better assessment of pupil\n    understanding?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Check whole class understanding\n\nRosenshine suggests that the wrong way to check for understanding is to call on only a few pupils who have volunteered their answers and then assume the rest of the class have the same level of understanding. This is because such a method doesn’t capture the understanding of the whole class. There may be pupils who do not understand the material you have taught but have not revealed this because they haven’t been asked to demonstrate their understanding. Therefore, it is important that you plan opportunities throughout your explanation to allow all pupils to show you their level of understanding.\n\nOne way to check whole class understanding is to ask pupils to show evidence of their understanding.\n\nThere are two ways in which you can do this:\n\n### 1. Multiple choice\n\nHere you give pupils answers to a question with a corresponding letter (a, b, c… ) or number ( 1, 2, 3… ). Pupils choose which answer they think is correct and when asked to, they show this to you _at the same time_ using fingers or by scribing the letter or number on their whiteboards. You then scan their fingers/whiteboards to check for their responses.\n\n### 2. Individual response\n\nHere pupils are not given multiple choice options. Instead, they show their working out or record their answer on a mini whiteboard and, when asked to, they reveal this to you _at the same time._ Although it can take longer to scan pupils’ answers, the process can still reveal misunderstandings.\n\nIt is important you ask pupils to show you their answer _in unison_ to prevent them from copying one another. If they copy someone else’s idea, you don’t have an accurate understanding of how that pupil’s learning is progressing.\n\nOnce pupils have revealed their answer, you should target certain pupils and ask them to explain why they have given or chosen that answer, especially if pupils have given a mixed response. This will highlight where misconceptions have formed which you can then directly address.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>What does this look like in practice?</h3>\nWatch one of the videos below of teachers assessing understanding of <em>\n  all\n</em> pupils and consider the following questions.

This has two benefits:\n\n- It gives pupils time to think about your questions and apply their understanding to generate a suitable response.\n- By naming the pupil _after_ asking the question, you encourage _all_ pupils to be ready with an answer because they don’t know who you will call upon\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>What does this look like in practice?</h3>\nWatch the video of a teacher providing pupils with enough wait time and consider\nthe following question.

This can be particularly tricky to get right and relies on you as a teacher maintaining high expectations of pupil responses. There are two things you can incorporate into your questioning to maintain high expectations of pupils and build their understanding of the material being taught. You can:\n\n- Ensure you do not complete pupils’ answers for them. By extending their answer with your own ideas, you are lowering your expectations of what a good answer is and assuming pupils know more than they do\n- Ask pupils follow-up questions which encourage them to build on their answer to extend and challenge them\n\n## Do not complete pupils' answers\n\nOne way to ensure you maintain high expectations of pupil responses is to ensure you ask follow-up questions to an incomplete answer rather than completing the answer for the pupils.\n\nOften teachers, unknowingly, complete or ‘round-up’ pupils' incomplete answers and then reward the pupil for their answer even though it wasn’t entirely their response.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nTeacher: How do I know that the answer will be an integer if I divide 1230 by 10?\n\nPupil: Because it ends in a zero.\n\nTeacher: Right. 1230 ends in a zero meaning it is a multiple of 10.\n$I\n\nThe teacher has added extra information but still indicated the pupil gave the correct response. The consequence is that pupils believe they are right and fully understand when they may not.\n\n### Asking further questions to enable the pupil to complete or build upon their answer\n\nIt can be difficult not to round-up pupils' answers as you want to keep the pace of the lesson and praise pupils for sharing their ideas. However, if you don’t address partially correct answers and probe for more detail then you have lowered your expectations of pupils and don’t provide them with an opportunity to extend their leaning.\n\nThe best way to avoid doing this is to ensure _you_ know what a good answer would be before asking the question. For example, it may be that the pupils need to give three specific pieces of information. Knowing this helps you identify _exactly_ what you want pupils to say. If/when they don’t provide you with a full answer, you can probe further.\n\nWays you can further probe a pupil’s thinking will be explored in the following section.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>What does this look like in practice?</h3>\nWatch the video to watch how a teacher probes pupils to provide more detail in their\nanswers and consider the questions below.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How did the teacher respond to the partially complete answer?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What impact did this have on the pupil’s response?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/w9d8SyZzMtk)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nDo not complete pupils' answers - Primary\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Do not complete pupils' answers - Primary [AD]](https://youtu.be/zt3gtOdwomM)\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/e3KWumo1mI8)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nDo not complete pupils' answers - Secondary\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Do not complete pupils' answers - Secondary [AD]](https://youtu.be/JsCtPhGuQbA)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nListen to Robert Gardener talking through why he ensures he does not complete pupils’\nanswers and an example of when he probed a pupil to provide more detail. $CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/7ldq9ifQMyQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nDo not complete pupils' answers - Robert Gardner at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nTeacher questioning is a very powerful tool in the classroom. One of the key aims of teacher questioning is to increase accountability or create accountability for all students in the room, and to generate a learning environment that is high challenge for all students, and that is regardless of their ability, we want to create that sense of challenge. Probing for more detail is one thing that we can do that helps us to achieve that goal, so using further questioning, further probing.\n\nThis is about us, as teachers, having high expectations of all students in the room, and high expectations of the answers that they give in response to our questions. We don’t accept want to accept half-formed or, especially, inaccurate answers; we want to push for the best possible answer.\n\nThere are a number of ways that we can do that in the lesson:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    We can further probe, so we can ask further questions, we can pose further\n    questions to reshape the answer\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using wait time is important as well, so once we've posed a question, if we\n    just wait for a moment, that allows a student time to articulate their\n    thoughts, to shape their response\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Also, we can, if we've posed a question, we can ask other students and they\n    can then support the original student; so, for example, the student gives a\n    half-formed answer, an inaccurate answer, we leave that student for a\n    moment, and then we question other students around the room. That allows the\n    student, the original student, time to reformulate, to reflect, to listen to\n    other students, and helps to push them to give a better answer.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nSo, in a recent lesson (I'm an English teacher) on <em>Macbeth</em>, we were\nlooking at some close analysis of a speech by Lady Macbeth. A student that I\nquestioned about the speech gave an incorrect or a partially correct answer\nabout a crucial plot event in the play. They indicated that Lady Macbeth “puts\nthe blame on someone else for what Macbeth does”. Now, this is partially\ncorrect, this answer, I just wanted more from the student. So what I did was I\nasked the student to reread the speech that we were looking at, the speech in\nquestion by Lady Macbeth where this plot detail is elaborated on by Lady Macbeth\nto Macbeth. Once the student had done that, I began to further probe, so I\nunpicked that speech with them, the key parts of the speech. So I was asking\nquestions, for instance, such as:\n<ul>\n  <li>“What did Lady Macbeth do with the bloody daggers?”</li>\n  <li>“Why did she do that?”</li>\n  <li>\n    “What was the impact of those actions once Duncan’s body was discovered?”\n  </li>\n</ul>\nAs I say, I really wanted to push the student to give a more full, a more\ncomplete answer. After thiat, I then returned to that key original question\nabout who Lady Macbeth intentionally frames for Duncan’s murder, so this probing\nmade sure that the student eventually got to a fuller, more rounded out, fleshed\nout answer.\n\nAs teachers, I think it is sometimes tempting to accept poorly formed, maybe even inaccurate answers. Maybe we want to appear encouraging to students, for instance, or to we want to maintain the flow of the lesson, the pace of the lesson. But the issue with that is that we can’t allow these misconceptions or even errors to become embedded – that's the danger if we don’t challenge them. So we must always challenge, we must insist on challenging incorrect or partially formed answers.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nDescribe an example of when you rounded up a pupil’s answer. Explain why you think\nyou did it, what impact this had on pupil understanding and what you could have asked\ninstead. $CTA\n\n## Ask follow-up questions\n\nWhen pupils give a correct answer, you can increase the challenge and extend their understanding by giving them further, more complex questions such as:\n\n- Ask how or why\n- Ask for another way to answer\n- Ask for better vocabulary\n- Ask pupils to integrate a related skill\n\nThese can be used in all subjects and phases.\n\n## Ask how or why\n\nRosenshine (2012) found that more successful teachers ask more process questions. Asking pupils to explain how or why they have come to an answer is an example of a process question as it checks pupils' reasoning and working-out. This is a simple way to stretch pupils’ answers.\n\nBy doing this, you are:\n\n- Checking pupils’ level of understanding and possibly revealing otherwise hidden misconceptions\n- Extending their understanding by asking pupils to verbalise their thinking - elaboration helps pupils to build mental models\n\nBelow is an example of what this might look like in practice:\n\n$I\nTeacher: What is the perimeter of the square?\n\nPupil: 20 metres.\n\nTeacher: How do you know?\n\nPupil: Because all the sides add up to 20.\n\nTeacher: How did you know the length of all the sides?\n\nPupil: Because one side was 5 metres and because it’s a square, all sides are the same length.\n\nTeacher: So…\n\nPupil: So, all the sides are 5 metres and 4 times 5 equals 20.\n$I\n\nHere, the teacher has pushed the pupil to reveal their deeper understanding by asking ‘how’ questions. It has helped the pupil make links with other knowledge, enabling them to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\n## Ask for another way to answer\n\nSometimes there is more than one way to give an answer. You can check pupil understanding by asking them to give another way of solving a problem or explaining their reasoning.\n\nTeacher: Fill in the blanks: __+ __ = 4\n\nPupil: Three plus one equals four\n\nTeacher: Can you think of another way to make four?\n\nPupil: Another way to make four is two plus two.\n\nTeacher: What if one was the first number in the equation? 1 + __ = 4\n\nPupil: One plus three equals four.\n\nBy doing this, you help pupils to build links within their knowledge and deepen their understanding of the concept, which in this case was addition.\n\n## Ask for better vocabulary or more precise expression\n\nPupils often provide answers in the simplest language, especially when they are unfamiliar with certain vocabulary. A great way to enhance vocabulary is by probing pupils to improve their language choices and use target vocabulary. In Early Years, it might look like this:\n\nTeacher: Why was mouse scared?\nPupil: Because he saw a cat.\nTeacher: Because he saw a what cat? Can you use an adjective to describe it?\nPupil: Because he saw a scary cat.\n\nBy including the ‘what’, the teacher has supported the pupil by indicating where the descriptive word should go in the sentence, providing a scaffold for their next response. In older age pupils the prompting might be slightly different:\n\nTeacher: Why was the mouse scared?\nPupil: Because he saw a cat.\nTeacher: Can you use two adjectives to describe the cat?\nPupil: Because he saw a large, scary cat.\nTeacher: OK, how about using one of our vocabulary words?\nPupil: Because he saw a large, menacing cat.\n\nHere the teacher has prompted the pupil to challenge themselves and improve their initial response. In other subjects or contexts, you might use the same structure to encourage pupils to use subject specific or technical language.\n\n## Ask pupils to integrate a related skill\n\nTo help pupils build connections between their learning from one lesson to the next, you can ask pupils to integrate one skill with another they have recently mastered. The example below demonstrates how this might look in a primary P.E. lesson:\n\nTeacher: Who can show me a narrow movement?\nPupil: Walks around with arms up high.\nTeacher: Who can show me a low, narrow movement.\nPupil: Slithers narrowly on the floor.\nTeacher: Who can show me a low, rolling, narrow movement.\nPupil: completes a pencil roll.\n\nBy doing this, you are joining up pupils’ learning and connecting new learning with existing knowledge in their mental model, in this case, of how to move your body in different ways.\n\n## What does this look like in practice?\n\n$CTA\nThere are many ways you can extend pupils’ understanding when they present correct answers. Watch the video of a teacher challenging pupils with follow-up questions to extend their understanding. Whilst watching, consider the following questions and then record your response in your notepad:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What type(s) of follow-up questions were used?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How did this impact pupils’ responses?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/StSpQViqrhE)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nAsk follow-up questions - Primary at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Ask follow-up questions - Primary at Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/L76nGADqy94)\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/1D122ip6wgc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nAsk follow-up questions - Secondary at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Ask follow-up questions - Secondary at Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/2jB0mtvcsg4)\n\n## Summary\n\nQuestioning is a vital tool to use within the classroom as it enables you to both assess pupils’ understanding and extend pupils’ learning. To use questioning to best effect, there are some principles to consider:\n\n- Avoid self-report questions - ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught\n- Check whole class understanding\n- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response\n- Do not complete pupils’ answers\n- Ask follow-up questions to extend and challenge pupils\n- Will pupils' benefit from scaffolds such as sentence frames when answering questions?\n\nIn your next mentor session and training session, you will explore questioning further and will plan questioning into a future lesson.\n\nIn the following week, you will then be observed using questioning to assess pupils' understanding and extend and challenge pupils.\n\n## Additional resources\n\nBelow are some additional resources that you might find useful in supporting your classroom practice:\n\nListen to Katherine Fas talk about scaffolding, how she has used it to support pupils and how to gradually reduce it in Primary\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/SRRXtj07JTc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nScaffolding learning - Katherine Fas at Teach First\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nScaffolding is a term that refers to a variety of instructional techniques and resources that are used to move pupils toward stronger understanding and, ultimately, greater independence in the learning process.\n\nThree key things that have supported me across the curriculum to scaffold learning are:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Worked examples, sometimes known as WAGOLLs, which stands for ‘What A Good\n    One Looks Like’\n  </li>\n  <li>Checklists</li>\n  <li>Thinking aloud</li>\n</ul>\nWorked examples or WAGOLLs are brilliant resources that demonstrate the final outcome\nexpected to pupils. They can be used to model the skills and standards expected through\nshared or guided writing, or they can simply be shared with your pupils who might\nfind it challenging when conceptualising the expected outcome of a task. These WAGOLLs\ncan then be displayed as a visual prompt for learners to access throughout the sequence\nof lessons and support them in magpie-ing ideas for their own work.\n\nChecklists are amazing. Giving pupils a checklist of criteria to meet when answering a question or completing a task is a really simple but massively effective way of scaffolding. A checklist provides a visual prompt and gives pupils an idea of how many steps they need to take in order to be successful, as well as the order in which they should take them.\n\n‘Thinking aloud’ or verbalising your thought processes as you complete a task is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate to pupils how they can apply their skills and prior learning to support them in achieving the learning goal. Talking through the steps and orally rehearsing example phrases shows pupils that answers aren’t automatic and take careful thought and planning. It’s also important to allow the pupils time to do this with their peers. Orally rehearsing the steps that they might go through first and giving feedback to each other before putting pen to paper is a really effective way of developing their metacognition and supporting them achieve.\n\nOnce pupils have been successful at a task using scaffolds, it’s important to challenge the learners to become more independent in their work. Over time, physical scaffolds should be removed so pupils don’t become dependent on them and, instead, internalise that process so they can draw upon it whenever they need. If we think of a house that has scaffolding round it, we wouldn’t want to keep the scaffolding up once the work had been completed! We would want to show off all the work that has gone on in developing it!\n\nThe first thing I would say when removing scaffolds is, it’s really important not to take away everything all at once. I would often start by reducing one element from my scaffolding bank, for instance: covering up the WAGOLL, or reducing the thinking aloud time to just ‘thinking time’, where pupils have time to plan the next stage of their work independently, whilst keeping all of the other components there. I would often vary this for different learners, depending on their needs. For instance, I found that children who struggle with processing benefit from discussing things out-loud more frequently, so I grouped these pupils together and encouraged the rest of the class to work independently using the checklist and WAGOLL alone. I would always remove the checklist last, and only when I was sure the items on them had been achieved whilst using it. To <em>slowly</em> remove the scaffold that the checklist provided, I wouldn’t take away the whole thing, but instead would leave gaps in the checklist according to my assessment of what the pupils were attaining. I then slowly reduced the number of items on there until pupils were completing the task independently. I would always build periods of reflection into this process whereby pupils could assess their progress against their independent piece and make amendments where necessary.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - Kelly Challis talks about scaffolding and why it is so important when planning, drafting and editing writing in Secondary\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIf there is one thing which I used constantly with all of my learners when I was teaching it was scaffolds.  Now these could range from structured frameworks for accessing and for exploring written text to a mind map for ideas which are to be developed into a body of text. Scaffolds don't make the content easier, they create access to that content and help pupils, particularly those with literacy difficulties, to demonstrate the richness of their answers on paper.\n\nIt is important to consider the idea of cognitive load when focusing on the purpose of a scaffold. Cognitive load theory by Sweller (1988) is a way of thinking about the total amount of information which a person is dealing with and processing at any time. For example, if you have a learner that finds reading text difficult but the objective of that lesson is to comprehend that text, a learner’s cognitive load may be taken up with the process of reading, decoding the words, the speed of reading, the length of the text, the familiarity of the text or the stress of doing something which they perceive as a challenge rather than the set task of comprehending.\n\nThis is where scaffolding comes in. That same learner, if they are aware of some of the complex vocabulary that they will be reading in that text, if they have been given some guidance on how to scan a text and read it for meaning or signposted to the areas of text which they need to read closely, or if they have been modelled how to read through that text and identify the areas by highlighting parts of the text to aid comprehension later in the lesson. Everything I've just described could be a scaffold, none of them make the content any easier but the process of reading has become easier and thus the working memory load has more capacity for the teaching material.\n\nAnother example of a good scaffold to use and one which I have recommended several times to the schools that I work with is a task planner. This really helps those learners with literacy difficulties but also those that struggle with organization as it allows them to make sense of what they need to do. It also enables them to tick off what they've achieved in the lesson and for you, as a teacher, to see whether they are ready to move on from a scaffold.\n\nThis is an example of making the implicit explicit through the use of concrete examples. Sharing those planning techniques that we may take for granted as teachers. The Education Endowment Foundation in their 'Metacognition and self-regulated learning' resource make reference to research supporting the idea that those learners who find learning difficult do not use these kinds of scaffolds and strategies inherently as some more successful learners do. Teaching those learners these kinds of strategies is not giving them an advantage, it's equipping them with useful strategies they can continue to use in their learning.\n\nLet me finish off by giving you some examples of strategies for planning, drafting and editing.\n\nWhen planning, mind mapping is fantastic for getting ideas down quickly and this can then be extended by linking the ideas and prioritising them using numbers to then create a plan.\n\nWhen drafting writing, having an expectation of what the finished article will look like to demonstrate how the piece of text should start and what content should be included in the body will help a learner frame their ideas. It is important to explicitly teach different purposes of writing and how these impact upon the writing structure, for example, teaching pupils what a compare and contrast essay would be like or what a newspaper article would look like. When doing this you can use effective questioning to draw out known information.\n\nFinally both when writing and editing work, using a checklist can act as a great scaffold. For example, when I was teaching, I would often suggest to their learners in exams to put the punctuation at the top of the page and whilst they were writing tick them off. Being able to critically look at your own piece of work is difficult, and editing is hard at any age, so having a criterion to check your work against helps make the implicit explicit.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nListen to Joanna Macaulay talk about the importance of independent practice\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/oaGYOqOlRR0)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nIndependent practice in secondary - Joanna Macaulay at Northern Education Trust\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThe ability of pupils to apply their learning in a new context is the benchmark that something has been learnt. According to Hattie, “learning is the process of developing sufficient surface knowledge to then move to a deeper understanding such that one can appropriately transfer this learning to new tasks and situations”. Independent practice is used to develop this deeper understanding.\n\nIn order to prepare your pupils for independent practice and to help them achieve meaningful success, you should provide clear explanations and models to develop the pupils' understanding of necessary foundational knowledge and skills.\n\nWhen pupils are engaging in independent practice, you should be the ‘thermostat’ in the room. You should provide assessment opportunities to identify when to turn the temperature up and increase the level of challenge given to pupils, and when to turn the temperature down and provide additional support or even re-teach material to help pupils master challenging content.\n\nIndependent practice is the long-term goal for all teachers because it is the point in the teaching cycle where teachers can accurately access if pupils “have got it”.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### High expectations\n\n_1f.

Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and learning needs.\n\nThe function of assessment sounds relatively simple: find out what the pupil knows, and doesn’t know, and plan subsequent opportunities to impart the relevant knowledge or skills based on the identified need. And yet, it can be a challenge to reliably assess a pupil’s level of understanding. For example, an ‘on-task’ child may appear to understand their learning, yet the work they are so busily producing may be full of errors based on an unidentified misconception. In the same way, only by removing the learning scaffold from a seemingly confident pupil might you discover that they cannot replicate the learning in a standardised test – implying that the knowledge was not firmly encoded into the long-term memory in the first place. It is therefore critical that you have a clear understanding of what makes assessment effective in order to best support impactful teaching and learning decisions.\n\nGood assessment provides teachers with reliable information about pupils’ understanding. However, for this information to be of real value, the teacher must use it effectively to inform feedback and support pupils to move forward.\n\nWatch Professor Rob Coe as he explains why assessment is such a powerful teaching and learning tool, and what information it can give you about your pupils. You can make notes in your notebook if you wish.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/rU9KawFgRNI)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nFormative and summative assessment - Mick Walker\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nSo very crudely formative assessment is generally understood as using assessment to inform future learning or teaching and I tend to stress both learning and teaching. It usually means the use of assessment to check learning has taken place. And is it the learning that we intended, and if not what are we going to do directly about this. In short, it has to influence further development. It could involve the learner alone, identifying an error or gap in their knowledge by checking his or her own work, or against an exemplar, or in a conversation with a peer, but this really does need structure. Or it might be the teacher asking probing questions to check that learning has taken place and used to identify gaps or misconceptions. But either way the action requires a further action.\n\nSummative assessment conversely is usually a term used to describe an assessment at the end of a period of learning. For example, at the end of a topic, at the end of the year or the end of a course, to show what has been achieved or not. These outcomes often use information such as marks, grades, pass/fail, merits/distinction. But no other detail is given back to the end-user. But although it's worth trying to understand what people actually mean when they use such terms, I wouldn't get too attached to either of these terms as types of assessment because they're not types. In reality these terms describe in quite blunt terms and very broad terms a purpose to which we put a particular assessment.\n\nPaul Newton listed I think about twenty-two purposes for assessment, so the starting point has to be around the purpose. As for educational assessment, be it about questioning, about teaching session, designing the written examination or test, the key questions are, ‘What really are we trying to assess? Why are we trying to assess it and what are we going to do with the outcomes? How are we going to record or share the outcomes with other people?’ Then you can ask about the best way that this can be achieved.\n\nAllocating labels like formative, often referred to Assessment for Learning, and summative, often referred to as Assessment of Learning, is quite a blunt approach and can actually be misleading. For example, in so-called summative assessment, for example, a GCSE or a Key Stage Two test, even here there are formative possibilities. Both of these assessments result in production of analysis. Item analysis where you can get a look at the performance of individual questions, so for example you could analyse the outcome of the questions to see how your school or pupils did on question one compared to question three. And that might be something about how we taught the topic or even did we even teach that topic? The outcome of this investigation may not be formative for the pupils, they've now left the school. But the analysis might help the teacher to identify areas of weakness in the teacher’s knowledge gaps or course coverage. That could be considered as formative in a sense, at least in my view, because that would inform future teaching and probably some professional development for the teacher.\n\nSo for me these terms describe the use to which a particular assessment is put rather than being a type of assessment, in that the same test instrument could be used for either purpose in effect. A particular concern, at least to me, is that these terms are too often presented as being polarised as though if they were at some different ends of a spectrum and in opposition. But in reality they're not; you could use one test, one question, and put the outcome to different purposes. So they're not types of assessment but dependent on the inferences that we take, the conclusions that we reach or we draw on the evidence that we've elicited from our assessment. So be wary of labels and focus on what it is that you want to assess and what you want to get out of an assessment.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs highlighted by Mick, effective assessment has a purpose, and before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision that the results will be used to support, and able to justify its use. When deciding on which assessment to use, consider the following questions to help you select which method is going to be most effective:\n\n$I\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are you trying to assess?</li>\n  <li>Why are you trying to assess this?</li>\n  <li>What are you going to do with the information?</li>\n  <li>How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?</li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nAlthough it is certainly important to be aware of the terminology surrounding assessment, when considering what is effective in assessment, Mike highlights the possibility of using summative assessments in a formative way (for example, working on a single exam question during a lesson), or using information you have gathered in your formative assessment in your summative judgments. He instead asks teachers to focus on the purpose for the assessment, and to be clear on the decision it will be used to support.\n\n### Activity\n\nA teacher has reflected on the purpose of an assessment opportunity they have planned for their next lesson.\n\nThey answered the four questions in the following way:\n\n#### What are you trying to assess?\n\n_I want to assess whether my pupils have grasped the concept of a coordinating conjunction._\n\n#### Why are you trying to assess this?\n\n_I am assessing their knowledge of this for two reasons:_\n\n1. _To determine which, if any, of my pupils are ready for independent practice._\n2. _To help me decide where to direct my attention in the next part of the lesson._\n\n#### What are you going to do with the information?\n\n_The assessment information will tell me whether I can move onto the next part of the lesson, which will focus on pupils’ independent practice of the knowledge._\n\n#### How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?\n\n_The feedback to pupils is going to be almost immediate, as I will give them the answers to the multiple-choice questions. Based on their score, I will direct them towards the next task in the lesson. This may be independent practice, or a reteach by me._\n\nThis progression is usually a thought process undertaken when planning and is not typically written down. However, this is a good opportunity to take a few minutes to capture your thoughts and be able to discuss them with your mentor.\n\n$CTA\nSelect an upcoming assessment opportunity you have planned. This could be from a lesson or the assessment of a unit of work. Consider the purpose of the assessment and answer the questions below.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What are you trying to assess?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Why are you trying to assess this?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What are you going to do with the information?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How are you going to feedback the information to pupils?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBe prepared to discuss this activity at your next mentor interaction. $CTA\n\n## Assessment tasks linked to the lesson objective\n\nLet’s return to the questions posed by Mick Walker when deciding on the purpose of assessment:\n\n- **What are you trying to assess?**\n- **Why are you trying to assess this?**\n- **What are you going to do with the information?**\n- **How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?**\n\nOnce these questions have been considered, the only question remaining is **‘how** are you going to assess learning?’\n\nThere are multiple ways you could assess pupil understanding. The ‘how’ might take the form of questioning, a matching activity, a low-stakes quiz, a performance, through interacting with play, or various other methods that might lead to an indication of pupil understanding and highlight gaps in knowledge. The key is to make sure that the ‘how’, in whatever form that takes, is linked to the lesson objective and always supports you to indicate levels of understanding.\n\nRead the recount below from teacher and NQT mentor Mathew Sullivan. Mathew explains how the teacher had planned for the class to write a newspaper report as the assessment task, but that it didn’t create the assessment opportunity the teacher had hoped for.\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nRecount by Mathew Sullivan\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI observed a KS2 lesson on the Viking invasion at Lindisfarne. The lesson objective was very precise and would have allowed the teacher to make clear inferences about levels of pupil understanding. The objective was to recall the date and key events of the attack on the Lindisfarne monastery. Before the lesson we had spoken as a phase team about the five key pieces of knowledge we wanted pupils to recall from the invasion, and together we had created a presentation that emphasised these.\n\nThe beginning of the lesson was very effective, and the teacher even asked members of the class to act out key moments, which really brought the learning to life. The teacher then set the pupils a task to write a newspaper report on the events of the invasion as a method of assessing whether they could recall the key historical facts.\n\nWhen we sat down after the lesson and looked at what the pupils had learned, the results were somewhat below par. For the majority of the class, the format of the newspaper article had added a layer of complexity to the task that had distracted them from fully achieving the learning objective. Some had written very little, others had not written in the style of a newspaper article and had instead written prose as if they were answering a question, and only a small number had managed to achieve the correct newspaper features, but even they had difficulty ordering the events and deciding whether they should be writing from the perspective of an eye-witness, or the reporter themselves.\n\nWhen reflecting on why they had selected the newspaper report as an assessment task, the teacher explained that they thought it would be a ‘fun activity’ for the class to complete. However, with it being a full term since the class had completed a unit on newspapers, and no retrieval of key features had taken place in the lesson, the pupils were not able to demonstrate their learning effectively; remembering how to write a newspaper took precedence over recalling the key historical events. It has been my experience that my mentees can be more concerned with the ‘activity’ for the lesson, often asking themselves ‘what are we going to do tomorrow?’. The question that I often tell them to ask themselves instead is ‘what are we going to learn tomorrow?’. It is a subtle distinction, but one that puts the focus squarely onto the learning.\n\nAs the objective of the lesson had not being around creating a newspaper article, we discussed different activities that they could have set in order to meet the lesson objective. My mentee decided that a simple recount would have allowed pupils to better demonstrate their learning, and in turn would have provided a clearer indication of their understanding. We did both agree that a newspaper report would be an engaging way to recall the tale of the invasion, but only once the foundational knowledge of the events was assessed as secure, and the features of a newspaper article had been recalled.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nThis case study highlights the need to carefully consider the assessment tasks you plan for your class. Is the task giving pupils the opportunity to demonstrate their learning towards the lesson objective, and will it give you information about misconceptions or gaps in their knowledge?\n\nGood assessment helps teachers avoid being overly influenced by potentially misleading factors. In this instance, the teacher could have made some inaccurate inferences on pupil learning because the assessment task they set was not an effective method of assessing the target learning. If the task had been to write a recount of the events, the class would most likely have achieved a higher success rate, and the subsequent assessments would have been more accurate.\n\n$CTA\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nSelect a lesson that you will be teaching this week.

When I first started teaching, I probably didn’t assess as regularly throughout the lesson as I would now. Assessment would mainly take the form of questioning followed by the reviewing of pupil work after the lesson. Now it is something that is a constant feature of my teaching, and I have discovered a range of natural places to pause during a lesson and plan some intentional assessment opportunities.\n\nA key opportunity for assessment is the beginning of the lesson, and I often use this time to activate some prior learning from either the day before (as a recap) or a week or so ago (as more of a spaced/retrieval practice). Depending on how recently we learnt the topic, I often like to give a partially completed example which the pupils then complete, or a ‘find the error’ example where they find my mistake. I find these really help focus pupil thinking back to the topic knowledge and specifically the processes and steps that they need to implement in order to solve a problem. An example from literacy might be something like this (show starter)\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 100%;\">\n        Correct Mr Sulivan’s grammar mistakes: Walking through the viallage ,\n        sarah spotted some yellow ducklings on there own in the pond sarah new\n        that they must only be days old and that mabye their mother had flown of\n        to find some food for them\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI often put in common misconceptions or mistakes pupils usually make. Spelling of\nthe word ‘maybe’ as ‘mabye’, or missing a capital letter of proper nouns is really\ncommon.\n\nAnother opportunity to plan in some purposeful assessment is to consciously check for misconceptions forming in pupil knowledge. I have been teaching for over 10 years now, so I am more familiar with the types of misconceptions that can happen in each subject, but at the start of my career I found it really valuable to chat with experienced colleagues if I ever felt that I wasn’t sure what misconceptions could arise. I like to plan to check for potential misconceptions at two points of the lesson:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>As I am about to set pupils to their independent or guided task.</li>\n  <li>\n    And then again during the independent or guided task, I will move around the\n    room and look for misconceptions to correct instantly. This may involve me\n    stopping the whole class if I spot a misconception forming in several\n    pupils' work.\n  </li>\n</ol>\nI don’t do this for every lesson, but where I know there is a good chance of a common\nmisconception arising, I will give the class a question to answer which contains\nthe misconception. It is only a quick check, but it helps me get a sense of whether\nthe class is ready to try the independent work or which pupils would benefit from\nmore support.\n\nAn example of this would be:\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 100%;\">\n        Which sentence contains the correctly placed apostrophe?

How do you\n        know?\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nI find it helpful to anticipate potential misconception and be conscious and explicit\nabout them when I teach. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - Ashley Philipson on Planned Assessment Opportunities in Secondary\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nAssessment is an essential part of every lesson and should be present throughout. Although, the form in which it takes place may vary depending on the stage of pupils' learning and the tasks they are completing. Without assessment, lessons cannot address or meet pupils' needs.\n\n<h4>Assessing Prior Knowledge</h4>\nIn a series of lessons, we were looking at the issue of the development gap. The\ndevelopment gap is the difference in levels of development between the richest and\npoorest countries in the world. I wanted to plan in an opportunity to assess whether\npupils could recall the strategies we had previously covered before progressing with\nnew material.\n\nIn order to check pupils' deeper understanding, I planned to ask them to recall one strategy and give an example of how this strategy is used. I knew that by asking them to explain how it is being used, I could uncover any misunderstandings they may have about the strategies they recalled.\n\nI planned to check their understanding of this at the beginning of a lesson where the outcome was for pupils to evaluate the success of strategies used to reduce the development gap. I knew that they needed the <strong>prior knowledge</strong> of what different strategies could be used, before they could evaluate their success.\n\nI planned to begin the lesson with a settling task which pupils had to complete as soon as they came into the lesson. This retrieval practice would give me an insight of how much foundational knowledge the pupils could recall from the previous lesson.\n\nI planned to further assess this through question and answer, probing for further information from pupils to gain a deeper understanding of how these strategies help to close the development gap, why they might be used, and how successful they have been.\n\n<h4>Checking for misconceptions</h4>I planned to address <strong>\n  any misconceptions\n</strong> prior to moving on to the next part of the lesson, which was an explanation\nof how to evaluate the strategies. Here I planned to show an example answer to demonstrate\nthe structure of writing required to answer an ‘evaluate’ question. During this explanation,\nI planned to assess pupils' learning through question and answer to ensure I gave\nthem enough support before instructing them to complete the task.\n\nDuring the task, I planned to assess their ability to evaluate the strategies using the correct writing structure through live marking. This is where the teacher moves around the class while the pupils are individually working to assess understanding while pupils are completing a task. I find this form of assessment highly impactful because <strong>misunderstandings can be addressed immediately</strong> through face to face feedback, meaning further explanation or challenge can be given to the pupils as they need it. When implementing live marking, I would always check pupils who have demonstrated a weaker understanding first to provide further support if necessary. Planning assessment throughout my lessons in this way has a positive impact on pupil learning as no time is lost through lack of understanding. Any lack of knowledge or understanding that does become apparent can be remedied immediately or planned into following lessons. Because of this, pupils make good progress.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\nThink back to a previous lesson you have taught and answer the following questions in your notepad.\n\nWhat methods did you use to assess the following? Could you include any of the methods you have heard from fellow teachers into your practice?\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Assessing prior knowledge</li>\n  <li>Checking that pupils have met the lesson objective</li>\n  <li>Checking for misconceptions and addressing them</li>\n</ul>\n\n$CTA\n\n## Anticipating misconceptions\n\nWhen planning for effective assessment, all teachers in the previous section mentioned questioning and the planning of questions to check for pupil understanding at points across the lesson.\n\nEffective questioning was explored in detail in module 3. Below are some of the key features highlighted in that module that should be incorporated into your questioning.\n\n- Avoid self-report questions; ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught\n- Check whole class understanding\n- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response\n\nStructuring your questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions is a good use of planning time. It will mean that you gather information at key points in the lesson that will help you decide what to do next.\n\nA question type that can be a useful tool for identifying knowledge gaps and misconceptions is a **hinge** question. A hinge question can take the form of an individual question or multiple-choice question, and they are a check for understanding that allows you to gather assessment information from the whole class simultaneously. The reason they are called a hinge question is that they come at the ‘hinge-point’ of the lesson. This is a point where:\n\n1. you move from one key idea, task or learning point to another.\n2. understanding the content before the **hinge** is a prerequisite for the next part of the lesson.\n\nThe results of the hinge question will determine whether you move on to the next chunk of learning, or work to consolidate, practise or reteach the previous concept further. They are also very useful for helping you to determine whether a pupil has met the lesson objective or not.\n\n$I\nHere is an example of a hinge question for a primary science lesson:\n\nWhich of the following is true about the moon?\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n  <li>It reflects light</li>\n  <li>It orbits the earth</li>\n  <li>It can’t be seen during the day because there is too much light</li>\n  <li>It has no gravity</li>\n</ol>\n$I\n\nThis is an effective hinge question because:\n\n- The question allows the teacher to ascertain a snapshot of all pupils’ levels of understanding\n- It enables the teacher to be highly responsive to pupil needs and make a quick decision about next steps\n- The question would also not take long for the pupils to responds to and would not impact the pace of a lesson\n\n## Anticipating misconceptions\n\nOne useful feature of hinge questions, particularly those structured as a multiple-choice question, is that they can be designed to anticipate and monitor potential misconceptions in pupil understanding.\n\nLet’s look back at the example of the hinge-question above. If you look carefully at the potential answers, the teacher has designed them to include distracting options that, if selected by pupils, might highlight some of the common misconceptions in pupil thinking around this topic.\n\n$I\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n  <li>\n    It reflects light{\" \"}\n    <em>(the common misconception being that moon is a source of light)</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It orbits the earth{\" \"}\n    <em>(the common misconception being that the earth orbits the moon)</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It can’t be seen during the day because there is too much light{\" \"}\n    <em>(the common misconception being that moon only comes out at night)</em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It has no gravity <em>(this itself being the common misconception)</em>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n$I\n\nThrough carefully planning the questions, and aligning the possible answers to a common misconception, the teacher has been able to capture a large amount of useful assessment information from every pupil in the class. This information will enable them to make an informed decision about what steps to take next in teaching and learning.\n\nA hinge point question is designed to be a quick and accurate snapshot of understanding from all pupils. However, you should encourage pupils to share their emerging understanding and points of confusion, so that misconceptions can be addressed. Your follow up questions should be open, such as ‘why did you answer D?’ or ‘Can you explain your thinking further?’\n\nIn the clip below, you will see a primary teacher ask a hinge question around money. From the way he has designed the task and asked the question, it is evident that he has anticipated the class may have a misconception around coin size. In asking this question, and through the subsequent class discussion, he is attempting to address this misconception before independent practice begins.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/bifSUpxDS7U)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nAnticipating misconceptions - Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Anticipating misconceptions - Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/auiWIjL_lRo)\n\n### Encouraging deeper thinking\n\nA concern sometimes voiced over multiple choice questions is that they are highly effective at assessing some knowledge, but less effective at assessing higher order thinking skills.\n\nAn example to counteract this argument can be seen in the following question:\n\n$I\nWhich of these is the <strong>most immediate</strong> cause of Hitler becoming chancellor?\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n  <li>Nazi violence intimidated many voters and opponents</li>\n  <li>Schleicher’s authority collapsed</li>\n  <li>\n    Hindenburg and Von Papen believed they could control Hitler as chancellor\n  </li>\n</ol>\n(example question taken from ‘Responsive Teaching’, page 83) $I\n\nWith each answer being a correct cause of Hitler becoming chancellor, the question encourages deeper thinking, taking away a pupil’s immediate desire to identify the correct answer and move on, and instead prompting them to examine their knowledge and identify which answer was the** most immediate** cause.\n\n### Pedagogical subject knowledge\n\nStructuring your questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions will not only give you useful assessment information on your pupils’ knowledge and understanding, but it can be a useful barometer as to your own level of understanding of a concept.\n\nThe ease with which you can anticipate a misconception is directly related to how familiar you are with the subject matter. Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts should be an ongoing exercise for you in your early teaching career.\n\n## Structuring questions to enable to enable the identification of knowledge\n\n### Activity\n\nTo consolidate your learning from this session, complete the two short activities below to support your recall of key concepts.\n\n$CTA\n\n<b>Activity 1</b>\n\nConsider the following hinge-question.\n\n<i>Identify the </i>\n<b>\n  <i>verb</i>\n</b>\n<i> in this sentence:</i>\n\n<i>Claire walked her dog quickly past the spooky house.</i>\n\nIn your notepad, outline whether you think this is an effective hinge-question and why.\n$CTA\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nFeedback\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIt is an effective hinge question because:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It can be answered quickly</li>\n  <li>\n    It will allow the teacher to gather assessment information from the whole\n    class at once\n  </li>\n  <li>The other question options are plausible</li>\n  <li>It would highlight misconceptions in pupil thinking</li>\n</ul>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<b>Activity 2</b>\n\nSelect an upcoming lesson and identify a hinge-point within the lesson.\n\nDesign an effective hinge question that you could ask at this point in the lesson that will help you identify the next steps in teaching and learning.\n\nEnsure that:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    pupils should be able to give an answer to the question quickly (two minutes\n    or less)\n  </li>\n  <li>you have included common misconceptions</li>\n</ul>\nYou may wish to discuss the construction of this question at your next mentor interaction.\n$CTA\n\nThe focus of your next observation and mentor interaction will be around how you structure your tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### How pupils learn\n\n_2g.

If you do spot a mistake, how best should this be corrected?\n\nThis session will focus on:\n\n- Monitoring pupils' independent practice for the development of misconceptions\n- Deciding when is best to give feedback, and what form that will take\n\n## Monitoring pupils’ work for misconceptions\n\nAs mentioned at the end of session 2, ensuring that you have excellent subject knowledge will mean that you are better equipped when considering where misconceptions in pupil thinking and understanding may occur.\n\nUnderstanding a potential common misconception in a subject will inform your planning, how you deliver your explanations, and the scaffolds you will provide. It will also support the assessment opportunities you include and dictate where they will be most needed in the lesson. You will use those opportunities to check understanding and assess whether a misconception has occurred.\n\nSession 2 explored the structuring of hinge questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions, but a further key opportunity to spot a pupil with a misconception is during independent practice.\n\n## Monitoring independent practice\n\nDespite careful planning and sequencing of knowledge, and in spite of checking for understanding at key points in the lesson, pupils can still develop misconceptions. It is often during independent practice that these come to light, and you discover there has been some misunderstanding earlier in the lesson. It is therefore essential that you monitor independent practice and act where appropriate.\n\nA good strategy to help you monitor independent practice is to circulate around the class during the session.\n\nSome teachers move around the classroom checking to make sure pupils are ‘on track’. However, this can often mean they are focusing on completion of work, as opposed to mastery of skills.\n\nWhen circulating effectively, you will notice two things:\n\n- **Examples** **of success** (these could be showcased to the class)\n- **Examples of specific mistakes/errors** (these should be considered before the lesson)\n\nThe amount of assessment data you could collect by circulating can be overwhelming. You may notice layout issues, poor handwriting, spelling mistakes and more, so it is important to plan to look for specific data and consider a way to track this data that will allow you to refer to it after the lesson.\n\nOne straightforward method of tracking data during the independent practice is by printing out the class register and completing the following steps:\n\n- Prior to the lesson, consider what it is you are wanting to monitor during the practice\n- Create a simple code that can signal pupil understanding.\n\n$I\nAn example of this tracker might be as follows:\n\n<strong>Potential error</strong>\n\nCodes:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Pupil did not invert fraction before beginning calculation</li>\n  <li>Pupil did not express answer as a mixed number fraction</li>\n</ol>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 102.994%;\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 50%;\">Pupil Name:</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 50%;\">Code: 1 or 2</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Joe Bloggs</td>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">1 &amp; 2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Jane Bloggs</td>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n$I\n\n## Monitoring Independent practice in action\n\nTo demonstrate how to monitor pupil work effectively for misconceptions by circulating, watch the following clips of teachers in action.\n\nIn this EYFS clip, you can see the teacher anticipating and addressing a misconception around number order.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R96cQ0RHMzU&feature=youtu.be)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nMonitoring independent practice - Early Years at Ark John Keats Academy\n\nIn this KS2 clip, you can hear the teacher anticipating a grammar misconception around proper nouns and addressing individuals on their spelling and work.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzK84wN0iYA&feature=youtu.be)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nMonitoring independent practice - Primary at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Monitoring independent practice - Primary at Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/98ptG8Smv-0)\n\nIn this KS4 Maths lesson, you can see the teacher monitoring pupil work with a focus on anticipating a common misconception around decimals and the interior angles of a quadrilateral.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/MPuB1MbeQ2o)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nMonitoring independent practice - Secondary at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Monitoring independent practice - Secondary at Reach Academy](https://youtu.be/j54awoEwUIY)\n\n## Monitoring pupils' work for misconceptions\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Activity</h3>\nSelect an upcoming lesson plan to review.\n\nIdentify a moment in the lesson where pupils would engage in independent practice.\n\nWhat might be the two or three potential errors they could make during this time? Make sure that the errors you select will help you monitor their understanding and check for a misconception.\n\nWrite the errors in your notepad.\n$CTA\n\nMonitoring work and acting on information will be the focus of your next observation and mentor interaction. You may wish to discuss this activity with your mentor at your next meeting to see whether they agree with your identified potential errors.\n\n## When should you give feedback?\n\nWhen monitoring pupil work across the lesson, you are constantly making decisions around what to feed back to individuals, and what is necessary to address with the whole class. Research indicates that providing feedback is one of the most effective – and cost effective – ways of improving pupil learning. But what should the feedback look like, and when should you give it?\n\nA recent synthesis of information by the [Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/feedback/#closeSignup) (EEF) concluded that, on average, the provision of high-quality feedback led to an improvement of **eight additional** **months** of progress over the course of a year. However, providing effective feedback can be challenging, and the research also highlighted that when feedback is not given well it can have a negative impact on pupil progress.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>When should you give feedback?</h3>\nResearch studies into feedback do make a distinction between a ‘mistake’ and an ‘error’.\n\n<strong>Mistake</strong> – something a student can do, and does normally do correctly,\nbut has not on this occasion.\n\n<strong>Error</strong> - which occurs when answering something that a student has\nnot mastered or has misunderstood.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(EEF, 'A Marked Improvement?', page 12)</p>\n$I\n\nIf a pupil makes a mistake, how much feedback is it worth giving in order to correct the mistake? The EEF ‘[A Marked Improvement?](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Presentations/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf)' (2016) report concludes that it should be marked as incorrect, but that the correct answer should not be provided. The rationale for this is that, if a pupil is given the correct answer, it means they are no longer required to think about the mistakes they have made, and as a result are likely to repeat the mistake again.\n\nConversely, if a pupil has made an error and therefore has a potential misconception, the report recommends that it is most effective to remind the pupil of a related rule or offer a hint towards a correct answer. If the error was treated the same as a mistake, by simply marking it incorrect, a pupil would not have the knowledge to work out what they have done wrong.\n\n## When should you give feedback?\n\nKnowing when to give feedback, and what type of feedback will be most effective, can be challenging, particularly as research has identified that feedback can sometimes have a negative impact on pupil progress.\n\nWhilst monitoring your pupils you may notice errors occurring. When this happens, there are four different ways that you could correct the error in your pupils' thinking:\n\n- Immediate correction of the individual who has made the error\n- Immediate class correction\n- Through detailed marking\n- Addressing the error through planning for the next lesson\n\nAs a teacher you will use the information from your assessments to inform the decisions you make. You may notice that there is a common error occurring, and it is therefore appropriate to stop the whole class to ensure that the misconception does not become ingrained. It can sometimes feel daunting to stop the class during independent practice, but by doing so, it will save you time when marking pupil work as you will not need to write the same comment repeatedly. It will also mean you will not need to plan to undo new errors in thinking in subsequent lessons.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nReflect on the last time you stopped the class to address a common error.

The codes were introduced across the department and this therefore ensured consistency of use, which enabled both teachers and pupils to begin to understand them far quicker.\n\nA few examples of our codes are: P: point, Ev: evidence, Ex: explanation.\n\nWhen we introduced the codes, it was important to model their use for the pupils and we marked a series of modelled answers on the board together. I used the “I do, we do, you do” approach and I was able to show my pupils how they should expect to see them presented in their work and what this meant that they needed to do as an action.\n\nOn a practitioner level, I find the marking code effective as it helps me to provide meaningful feedback to my pupils. I find that they understand the code quickly and can begin to action feedback immediately. It has also had a positive impact on my workload as it is quicker to denote where success and areas for improvement are by using the symbols, rather than having to write lengthy prose. This saves me time and I can therefore invest that time into planning improvement tasks or planning for their next lesson where the pupils will actually have the opportunity to incorporate those improvements. I also find that when we are looking at work as a department, the marking code enables standardisation. I use the same codes as all the other teachers, and it makes cross referencing across the department quick and effective. We are able to look at a students' work, see where the teacher has identified where they think a criteria has or has not been met, and then we can check through it. Alternatively, during blind standardisation (when we all have clean copies of the same script) we can then discuss it and if there is disagreement about the mark the question should be awarded, that’s when we can query why one person thinks there is sufficient evidence or not by using the symbols to zoom in on those areas in the question.\n\nMy use of the marking code isn’t only kept for marking after the lesson, I also use it during my lessons to support with live marking. I circulate the room and use the marking codes to assess pieces of work and provide areas for improvement instantly. The pupils can then respond immediately, and I can support them with that where necessary.\n\nI find that the pupils have responded well to the codes, it has empowered and encouraged them to take responsibility for their own learning as well as providing them with a tool that can reassure them as they write their answers. For example, they can abbreviate PEE in the margin as they write.\n\nThe codes have also supported my classes to effectively self/peer assess as pupils are then able to plan, review and assess their own progress. This is powerful for when completing tasks and also in preparation for examinations. I will not be in the exam with them, so the symbols help them to self-mark and correct where necessary, supporting them to understand and internalise what a good answer looks like.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - Symbol marking by Sharon Stephenson\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nYellow box highlighting is used regularly to highlight a particular focus that needs addressing. The yellow box is explained to the pupils at the beginning of the academic year. In year 2 this is used consistently when marking an end of unit assessment in English (the final writing piece of the genre taught, e.g. a poem, character description, a letter, retelling of a story, etc.).\n\nThe yellow box is modelled by the teacher around a short piece of writing, e.g. a sentence or two that has a lot of mistakes which then need to be corrected. The teacher models reading the piece of writing together with the class – not pausing where full stops need to be inserted, reading words as they are written (phonics) that sound incorrect, letters written back to front, etc.\n\nThe teacher then models to the class how to spot the mistakes but also encouraging ideas for the pupils as they read along and spot other mistakes. The teacher models how to correct and edit along with pupils editing too. The teacher also models the correct use of grammar and questions pupils on this as the text is read out loud.\n\nOnce the areas to improve have been identified and the discussion has taken place about the ideas to edit, the whole of the section highlighted in yellow is rewritten to show the completed version of editing.\n\nTo reinforce, in Key Stage One this would be a short sentence (or two for year 2).\n\nThe work is always re-marked (alongside the pupils) to ensure the pupils see this has been acknowledged and to ensure they understand the purpose of editing and feeling pride in their finished pieces. Over time pupils are then able to self-correct and self-improve after reading through a yellow box that is highlighted. For some pupils, support may still be required to address key areas to improve, e.g. grammar, past / present tense or spelling of words that have already been taught within the spelling programme used.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Summary\n\n### Responding to feedback\n\nA key point to remember about effective feedback is ensuring that pupils have sufficient time to respond to it.

However, you cannot expect pupils to master the art of effective peer and self-assessment without first understanding how to meaningfully respond to feedback themselves, and second, having a clear mental model of what effective peer and self-assessment looks like.\n\nWhen done well, peer and self-assessment can:\n\n- Give pupils the opportunity to think carefully about their own learning and that of their peers\n- Reduce marking load for the teacher\n- Allow pupils to develop their mental model of what success looks like in a task and support them to develop transferrable knowledge\n- Support self-regulation and independence\n\nWhen done poorly however, it can lead to:\n\n- Poor progress for pupils\n- A waste of lesson time\n- Pupils focusing on the wrong learning points\n- Pupils developing a poor mental model of effective feedback\n- The development of misconceptions\n\n$CTA\nWatch the following video of Stuart Kime from Evidence Based Education as he explains what is needed to establish effective peer and self-assessment in your classroom.\n\n<strong>Record any notes in your notebook.</strong>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/g1GGBSpgQnI)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nPeer and self-assessment - Secondary\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWhen using peer and self-assessment, I always start with the ‘why’. For it to be successful, the pupils need to see the purpose in doing it. I like to explain the benefits; such as ‘you can identify mistakes and self-correct', ‘your peer can provide alternative viewpoints or suggestions to develop your work’, they can be a ‘friendly second eye’ catching any errors that you may have made.\n\nIn my classroom, self-assessment can range from retrieval quiz marking, to peer debate assessment, to feeding back on written work. Different practitioners use different assessment tools such as ‘Whatt Went Well’ and ‘Even Better If’ or ‘2 stars and a wish’ etc. My advice would be to select one approach to self-assessment initially, and be consistent with it, measuring the impact as you do.\n\nWhen pupils have an opportunity to peer assess work, I always ensure that feedback is positive, developmental and non-threatening, and I stress that it should be friendly, informative and specific. My class initially gave feedback to each other that was very simplistic, such as ‘even better if: you write more’ or ‘even better if: you complete it’. To ensure feedback was useful, I provided pupils with a clear mark scheme or success criteria, and ensured that the improvement points reflected that mark scheme. To achieve this, it took a lot of modelling from me. Each time I modelled giving feedback, I made my improvement areas link back to the success criteria by giving a specific example such as ‘EBI: you used a specific range of evidence’\nA specific example of self and peer assessment in action is from a GCSE class where we completed an assessment (key task). Whilst it is a teacher assessed piece of work, I get them to self-assess it first. This empowers them to be able to assess their own work and identify for themselves their own improvements, which they will have to do in examinations – they need to be able to look back over their work and determine if they have met the criteria and where they need to amend or add in additional knowledge. At the end of the assessment, I asked them to mark their answers using marking codes. They did this in green pen and identified for themselves where the improvements needed to be made. This is very useful as well because when I then mark their work, it lets me know if they have interpreted the success criteria correctly and that they understand the components of the question and the knowledge that they have applied. Instead of me having to infer why they may have got an aspect wrong, it helps me to really zoom in on their understanding – is it that they knew for themselves they had not been successful in that area (for example, “my evidence was inaccurate, it should have been….”) or whether they didn’t pick up on that being an error and marked it correctly (which means they have a misconception and that I need to re-teach them). I then give them their responses back so that they can action the areas that we have agreed need to be improved.\n\nI used peer assessment when asking pupils to assess practice examination questions. When doing this, I made sure that I had a clear mark scheme available to them that was pupil-friendly and accessible. This enabled pupils to clearly identify where marks were awarded and how to understand the difference between the levels, so that they could look at how to progress.\n\nWhen setting this up in the classroom, I saw it as an evolutionary approach that I would have to build on over time to ensure pupil understanding, avoid working memory overload, and check that the system was being applied correctly. I clearly modelled how to give the feedback and spoke aloud about my thought process at each step. This helps me to constantly reinforce my expectations. For the pupils' first attempt, I also scaffolded their feedback using and corrected their responses where appropriate. My pupils soon started to identify ‘this is where I need to improve, this is what I need to improve, this is how I need to improve it’.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Prepare for your next mentor interaction by selecting an example of\n  self-assessment completed by a pupil in your class.\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### Metacognition and self-assessment\n\nYou have been introduced to the concept of metacognition in module 2 and built on this in module 3 through the strategy of ‘thinking aloud’. Alongside supporting pupils to move new learning into the long-term memory, developing metacognitive strategies will also improve their independence and ability to self-assess and think critically about their own learning.\n\nImagine a group of pupils that were independent enough to effectively self-assess by evaluating their knowledge, identifying gaps in their learning, determining the effectiveness of their work and planning to make the relevant changes in the future. Metacognitive strategies support pupils to be able to do this by focusing on developing their ability to** plan, monitor and evaluate** their own learning. Pupils will effectively be self-assessing their progress as they move through the task, as well as after the fact.\n\n### How can you teach pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate learning?\n\nThe first step is to ensure that pupils have secure subject knowledge in the area in which they are applying the metacognitive strategy. Without knowledge, pupils will not be able to apply the strategies they are being taught. Instead, they will still be trying to understand and learn the concept, rather than reflecting effectively on how well they have learnt it and what they need to do next.\n\nThe next step is to know that development of metacognitive strategies requires explicit teaching and modelling in order to train pupils’ thinking.\n\nThe EEF report into metacognition and self-regulation highlights that you should ask pupils questions that focus their thinking on how they could plan, monitor and evaluate their learning. The teacher should also explicitly model this thinking in order to develop it in their pupils.\n\n---\n\n#### Plan\n\nEncourage pupils to think about the goal of their learning and how they will approach the task.\n\n_How will I approach the problem? Which strategies will I use? How do I manage my resources?_\n\n#### Monitor\n\nEmphasising the need for pupils to assess the progress they are making as they go.\n\n_What is working? What isn't working? Why am I finding this challenging?_\n\n#### Evaluate\n\nAppraising the effectiveness of their plan.\n\n_How did I do?_\n\n---\n\nThe EEF have developed seven practical recommendations that support the teaching and development of metacognition in pupils. Two of these strategies have been covered in this ECF programme. Take five minutes to [review the remaining five](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/Summary_of_recommendations_poster.pdf).\n\n## Effective self and peer assessment\n\nOne of the seven recommendations for teaching metacognitive strategies is to encourage pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning.\n\n$CTA\nConsider the scenario below. Then, after each verbalised thought in the table, identify whether it would support a pupils’ ability to better <strong>plan, monitor or evaluate </strong>their own learning.\n\nScenario:\n\nYou have asked your pupils to draw or paint a self-portrait. Knowing that modelling the task will give pupils a clear idea of what success in the task looks like, you draw your own self-portrait in front of the class. Knowing also that an effective way to develop metacognitive strategies and self-regulation in your pupils is to verbalise your thinking, you talk aloud through your model, articulating why you have made the choices that you have.\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width: 50%;\">Verbalised thought</th>\n      <th style=\"width: 50%;\">Plan, Monitor, or Evaluate?</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n        1.

A summative assessment is a snapshot in time in pupil learning, and it is important to recognise what they can and can’t tell you about pupil understanding.\n\nThis session will focus on:\n\n- The importance and challenges of summative data\n- Identifying patterns of performance\n\n## Summative assessment\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/IsHeGLP-VEQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nUses and limitations of summative assessment – Professor Stuart Kime at Evidence Based Education\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nIf you can picture an end of year test in your mind, you probably know what a so-called ‘summative assessment’ looks like. It’s a way of creating a snapshot in time of how you performed in a certain set of conditions on a relatively small part of the curriculum. And as such, the interpretation of scores from such assessments should reflect these facts. Crucially, don’t overinflate the importance of summative assessment data. The information produced by assessments that have summative purposes generally comes in the form of grades and scores generated by end of unit or end of year tests. Such information can help summarise students' performance against set criteria like marking rubrics or against something like a class average score and this information can be useful for these purposes, but you should always keep in mind the limitations of it. A single grade or score can hide a lot of useful information about a student’s strengths and areas for improvement.\n\nKeep in mind that a student’s performance on a single test, on a single day, can be affected by all kinds of things that are unrelated to what they’re being tested on. While you might want to know how well a student can do on an algebra test, the streaming cold they’re still getting over will likely affect their performance adversely. Similarly, there might be things going on at home, which are playing on their mind during the test.\n\nAnd finally, students scores on summative assessments are often put onto a school system and maybe reported to parents. And this process increases both the workload involved but also the perceived importance of the information generated. Measuring and recording seem to heighten its status even though the status may be unwarranted by the accuracy and the utility of the information itself.\n\nSummative assessment in your school is one part of the jigsaw puzzle of information you’ll assemble about students. It’s a long-term process that can reveal interesting and useful patterns about students' learning. By triangulating the information from multiple comparable tests of the same curriculum areas, you’ll increase your confidence in making sensible interpretations of the data. Are there certain tasks that students continually struggle with? Do you or colleagues need to intervene to address specific, deeply embedded misconceptions?\n\nAssessments with summative purposes should be used sparingly in school. If you want to see if your students have made progress from time point A to time point B, they need time to improve sufficiently for the tests to detect a meaningful difference. In and amongst all the noise that I mentioned before, many schools are now decreasing the number of summative assessment points that they have during a school year and are also trying to be more transparent with their students about why they’re doing them. Some are also studying the reliability of the data they generate and being clearer about what you can, and crucially cannot, say about a student’s performance.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n### A snapshot in time\n\nAs highlighted in the video above, summative assessments offer a “snapshot in time” of pupil performance. They test a cross section of pupil knowledge of the curriculum and allow performance to be recorded as a grade descriptor (e.g. ‘Emerging’ or 8). These grades are useful for establishing a shared understanding about pupil performance in comparison to others.\n\nEarlier in the module the difference between ‘learning’ and ‘performance’ was referenced. How a pupil performs in a test is not necessarily a direct reflection of their learning. External factors could have a negative impact on performance. Similarly, the questions in the test could play to the strengths of the pupil and their performance could be better than their pattern so far. It is therefore important to be aware of the limitations of summative assessments and be mindful about what inferences you can make from the data. You may hear a pupil who performs poorly in a summative test exclaim “I am no good at this subject!”, but when you review their performance patterns over time, it might be that their understanding is not secure in a few subject areas, but their overall subject knowledge is good. Paying attention to a pupil’s general patterns of performance over time will give you a better judgement overall.\n\n### Avoiding misleading factors\n\nThere are two types of summative tests:\n\n- the ‘difficulty model’ where the questions get harder as the test goes on\n- the ‘quality model’ which are generally essays or performance pieces\n\nFor summative tests to produce any shared meaning, they must consist of standard tasks. Both models must be completed in controlled conditions, in order for them to be a reliable indicator of performance. Using externally validated materials which have been nationally standardised also allows you to create a shared meaning of how your pupils are performing compared to the national picture.\n\nHowever, the validity of the judgements that can be made are more difficult with assessments that follow the quality model. This is simply down to the fact that quality model assessments usually have a mark scheme based on descriptors (rubrics). Markers may interpret the descriptors differently within an essay style question, and the same question may receive a different grading from separate markers.\n\nA way to negate this interpretation issue, and avoid any misleading factors that could impact on accurate assessments, is to moderate teacher judgments in teams. Moderation requires all teachers to review the same essay question or performance piece and discuss what judgment they would give and why. This is a task that needs to be repeated often in order to improve judgments overall. Over time, it will improve the reliability of the marks awarded by individual teachers and ensure better consistency across teams.\n\n## Analysing data\n\nWhen analysing your summative data, you will be looking for patterns in performance in classes, across topics, and with individual pupils. There may be topics where there is a pattern of pupils generally scoring consistently low in certain areas – you would therefore know that those pupils would benefit from the content being retaught. You will also be looking for pupils that require further targeting as a method of improving their performance. As referenced in the video above, summative assessment data can have a higher ‘perceived importance’ due to the reporting of it. However, it is important to remember that the grade boundaries are ‘lines in the sand’ and it is vital that you look beyond them and not simply target those that are in the lower boundaries. It is also useful to only record data when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes and not be attempting to capture summative ‘snapshots’ of data when formative assessments would be a more beneficial method of data collection.\n\n$I\nA good example of this is given by Daisy Christodoulou in her book ‘Making Good Progress’.\n\n<img\n  class=\"alignnone wp-image-3178 size-full\"\n  src=\"http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/09/making-good-progress.png\"\n  alt=\"A line chart that displays a bell curve moving from Working Towards, through Working At, to Working In Greater Depth. Pupil A is marked as being nearly at the end of the first third and is assessed as Working Towards, pupil B is just in to the second third and is assessed as Working At and pupil C is marked at the beginning of the curve and first third and is also assessed as Working Towards. \"\n  width=\"616\"\n  height=\"355\"\n/>\n\nThe graph highlights that pupil A and pupil C are given the same grade; both have been classed as ‘Working Towards’. However, you can see that the scores of pupil A and pupil B are closer and they have more in common.\n\nIf you were to pay attention to the grade boundaries only, you may target pupil C and A more than pupil B. However, it is clear that pupil B has only just crossed the grade boundary and therefore could - in another summative assessment – be graded as ‘Working Towards’.\n\nThis highlights that grading systems can be misleading, and it is important that teachers consider the narrative around their data when making inferences and decisions based on their data analysis.\n$I\n\n## Analysing data\n\nBelow are two possible activities, select only one that you wish to complete.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Activity 1</h3>\nSelect a recent summative assessment completed by an individual pupil.

However, for many pupils, there are barriers that prevent them from doing so. One potential barrier to learning is poor literacy skills (EEF, 2018).\n\nYou can support pupils’ literacy development whichever phase or subject you are teaching. To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:\n\n- The importance of high-quality oral language\n\n- Teaching vocabulary\n\n  - Developing language in Early Years\n  - Developing language in Primary and Secondary settings\n\n## The importance of high-quality oral language\n\nSpeaking and listening are vital skills for pupils to acquire. Not only do they form the foundations for competency in reading and writing, but they are also essential for thinking and communication (Higgins and others, 2015). And while the ability to think and communicate enables pupils to access the curriculum, these areas are also essential for all aspects of life – during, but also importantly, beyond schooling.\n\nIn addition, disciplinary literacy recognises that oracy skills are both general and subject specific (EEF, 2019). For example, the ability to respond in full sentences is a general skill, whereas the ability to correctly interpret the word “evaluate” is subject specific. This is because some vocabulary can carry different meanings in different subjects. In English Literature, “evaluate” questions often require pupils to justify their answers with reference to a personal response. Whereas in Physical Education, evaluation could ask pupils to consider the consequences of particular choices relating to diet or exercise.\n\nTherefore, developing pupils’ general and subject specific oracy skills should be a high priority for all teachers. Some ways you can develop these are by requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences and by teaching the meaning of vocabulary in the context of your subject.\n\nDuring lessons, pupils need receptive and expressive language to access the curriculum. Listen to Kelly Challis, from the Driver Youth Trust, talk about the difference between expressive and receptive language, and ways you can develop both in the classroom.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/oeqxZ_8d2oc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nDeveloping high-quality oral language - Kelly Challis\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nHaving a focus on high-quality oral language in the classroom is developing the foundation of good literacy skills. The first step in developing language skills is to consider your own language in the classroom:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How accessible is it?</li>\n  <li>How much you provide in one go?</li>\n  <li>\n    Do you use metaphors, sayings or subject specific vocabulary without\n    explaining the meaning?\n  </li>\n</ul>\nThese are all important questions to consider.\n\nLanguage can be split into two types: receptive and expressive.\n\nReceptive language helps pupils <em>understand</em> spoken language by enabling them to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>attend and listen to the speaker</li>\n  <li>apply meaning to spoken words</li>\n  <li>and understand grammatical markers.</li>\n</ul>\nExpressive language enables pupils to share their thoughts and feelings by:\n<ul>\n  <li>retrieving appropriate vocabulary from their memory stores</li>\n  <li>recalling speech sounds and patterns</li>\n  <li>\n    and then mentally constructing the sentence according to grammatical rules.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTo support pupils' receptive language in the classroom, you should give instructions:\n<ul>\n  <li>in small chunks</li>\n  <li>in the order you want them completed</li>\n  <li>And use prompts such as first, then and lastly.</li>\n</ul>\nTo ensure pupils have understood, you can encourage pupils to repeat back instructions\nthat you have given, whilst listening out for any misunderstanding.\n\nTo support pupils' expressive language in the classroom you should:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Model and teach high-utility vocabulary</li>\n  <li>\n    Model the correct response if the learner has made a grammatical error - pay\n    attention to errors with plurals or tenses\n  </li>\n  <li>Model the correct response with sensitivity</li>\n  <li>Encourage pupils to respond to questions in full sentences</li>\n</ul>\nWhen modelling and teaching vocabulary, you can introduce it by sounding it out and\nexplaining its meaning before using it in a sentence. Plan to discuss unfamiliar\nterms before reading or writing them and use these terms in a context that the pupils\nwill be familiar with to help them better understand.\n\nMake discussion part of your classroom activity and use as a precursor to written work. During discussion, ensure you model good listening skills as well as oral language. Set the parameters for the discussion before it takes place and scaffold pupils' responses by provide sentence starters such as,  ‘I would like to raise the point about…’ and the response to that which could be ‘I hear your point but I would like to say…’. By providing stock responses you support pupils to construct a good answer.\n\nWhen asking pupils to share their ideas, ensure you give pupils time to think and work through a response. I always use the analogy of dropping a feather, rather than a stone, in a puddle, to increase the thinking time I give pupils. To further support pupils who struggle to speak with clarity, consider recording their response for them to listen to. This will help them understand their current use of language which may help to identify where they can improve.\n\nWithout high-quality oral language, pupils struggle to access the curriculum. Therefore, every teacher, regardless of subject or phase, should be a teacher of literacy.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs Kelly identifies, both receptive and expressive language enables pupils to access the curriculum. Pupils require receptive language to understand what is being asked of them, and expressive language to communicate their thoughts and ideas, and to demonstrate their learning. You can develop pupils’ vocabulary by:\n\n- Modelling using full sentences to respond to questions and encouraging pupils to do the same\n- Implicitly and explicitly teaching vocabulary\n\n## Teaching vocabulary\n\nIn their guidance report on developing literacy in schools, the Education Endowment Foundation (2017) recognise the importance of both implicitly and explicitly developing language.\n\n### Implicit teaching\n\nTo implicitly teach vocabulary, the teacher might model using a word when speaking, point it out during shared reading and use it when modelling or completing shared writing activities. Implicit teaching ensures pupils encounter regular repetition of the word, making it more likely that the word will transition into the pupils’ vocabulary.\n\n### Explicit teaching\n\nTo explicitly teach vocabulary, a teacher would present the word along with explanations and examples of what it means, and then ask pupils to experiment with using the word.\n\n### A balanced approach\n\nIt is important that you both implicitly and explicitly teach new vocabulary, so that pupils are repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary, in any phase or subject, throughout the school day.\n\n### Which words do you need to model and teach?\n\nIsabel Beck and Margaret McKeown (2013) have created a helpful model that splits vocabulary into three different categories - Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. These are outlined in the figure below.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The tiers of vocabulary from bottom to top are: Tier 1: words for everyday speech. Tier 2: high frequency words. Tier 3: Low frequency and domain specific words. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Tiers-of-ocabulary-3-800x300.jpg $EndURL $Caption ‘Tiers of Vocabulary’, adapted from $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n### What’s the difference between these tiers?\n\nListen to Kelly Challis explain how each tier is different, and how you might teach them in the classroom. Record notes in your notebook.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/hJ9qciOOtuw)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTiers of vocabulary – Kelly Challis\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nA rich vocabulary not only allows a pupil to communicate effectively, it broadens the reading material they can access and allows them to develop their written work. A concept popular in education is the use of tiered vocabulary, which is the theory from Beck, McKeon and Kucan.\n\nThe three tiers are all important but how they are taught and built and when they become a focus in the classroom differ.\n\nTier 1 are basic high-frequency words. Words like clock, baby, big and small. Most of these words are learnt through speech in Key Stage 1. However, some of these words may continue to challenge a pupil if they are trying to spell them. Therefore, tier 1 words are great taught little and often through one-to-one spelling activities, where appropriate.\n\nTier 2 words are words which add richness to communication, whether that is verbal or written. Tier 2 words are the ones which we build over years of reading a variety of text, of talking to different people with different experiences. They should be taught directly in the classroom, explored from both a reading and a writing perspective. Tier 2 words cross subjects – they are applicable to many contexts and can be used in both speech and text.\n\nAn example of the difference between tier 1 and 2 words would be ‘nice’ to ‘wonderful’ or ‘silly’ to ‘absurd’.\n\nIf you are working on a piece of text, it's the Tier 2 words that should be drawn out of that text before you teach it or read it as a class. This can be done by looking at meanings, finding synonyms of that word, putting it into a context that the pupils are familiar with, before giving examples of when that word is being used in a sentence. During reading, highlight the words which have been pre-taught to draw pupils' attention to them in context.  You should limit the new vocabulary you teach to 5 words or so a week and revisit them throughout the term to strengthen pupils' long-term memory of them.\n\nTier 2 words can also be instruction or command words and these, for older children, are useful to be taught explicitly and identify the differences between them. For example, you should teach pupils what it means to write analytically as opposed to writing a discussion.\n\nFinally, tier 3 words are subject specific. They have a narrow reach when it comes to applying to other subjects. It is important for pupils to understand their meaning and application to the subject. What is less important is being accurate in their spelling, because they can be complex words. For those with literacy difficulties, to understand that word and to apply it in the right context is much more important than spelling it correctly. Tier 3 words are often introduced at the start of a topic, but teachers need to remember to refer back to them throughout the topic in order for them to become embedded in the memory of pupils.\n\nLet’s summarise how to address each tier in it in schools. Tier 1 words, if pupils are still finding these a challenge after Key Stage 1, teach them discreetly and targeted to that particular pupil.  Tier 2 words should be a whole-class activity to explore new vocabulary on a weekly basis. They are great for word walls because they apply to lots of different subjects. If they are used in a word wall, they should be supported by strategies of how to break those words down and how to write them. And finally, tier 3 words are subject specific so should change when the topic changes. They should be highlighted in text and if they are part of a worksheet these words should be given as a scaffold to pupils with literacy difficulties to remind them to use them and reduce the anxiety of having to spell them.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n### **How can you develop pupils’ language?**\n\nThere are a variety of ways that you might develop pupils’ language, and this is likely to vary depending on the age range you are teaching. Click on the most relevant link below to explore ways you can develop pupil language in the classroom.\n\n#### [Early Years](#early-years)\n\n#### [Primary and Secondary](#primary-and-secondary)\n\n## Developing language in Early Years\n\nIt is important that you provide high-quality interactions to pupils to support their language development.\n\nThis can be done through strategies which engage pupils in discussion about the activities they are completing, or experiences they are having. There is a distinction here between talking _with_ pupils and talking _at_ them (EEF, 2018). Talking at pupils tends to be more passive, while talking with pupils is more interactive; it’s the interaction that is important for language development, because it gives pupils the opportunity to practise their speaking skills.\n\nThere are a variety of different frameworks that can be used as a guide to support you when interacting with pupils during everyday activities, such as Sustained Shared Thinking (EEF, 2018). This framework enables teachers to expose pupils to Tier 1 and 2 language.\n\n### **Sustained Shared Thinking**\n\nSustained Shared Thinking is when two or more people work together to solve a problem, clarify an issue, evaluate activities, or extend a narrative (Siraj-Blatchford and others, 2004). During a task, the pupil(s) contribute their ideas and the teacher aims to extend and develop their thinking further by (EEF, 2018):\n\n- **tuning in** – listening carefully to what is being said and observing what the child is doing\n- **showing genuine interest** – giving whole attention, eye contact, smiling and nodding\n- **asking children to elaborate** – ‘I really want to know more about this’\n- **recapping** – ‘So you think that…’\n- **giving their own experience** – ‘I like to listen to music when cooking at home’\n- **clarifying ideas** – ‘So you think we should wear coats in case it rains?’\n- **using encouragement to extend thinking** – ‘You have thought really hard about your tower, but what can you do next?’\n- **suggesting** – ‘You might want to try doing it like this’\n- **reminding** – ‘Don’t forget that you said we should wear coats in case it rains’\n- **asking open questions** – ‘How did you?’, ‘Why does this…?’, ‘What happens next?’\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/91BSUnDYlvM)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nSustained shared thinking - Early Years at Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Sustained shared thinking - Early Years at Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/dnU8JyewEjU)\n\nThrough these strategies, you can probe pupils to engage in conversation about the activities they are doing, which in turn develops their language. When doing this, it is also helpful to model using full sentences to respond to questions and encourage pupils to do the same.\n\n## Implementing Sustained Shared Thinking\n\nNow you are going to apply elements of Sustained Shared Thinking to a scripted interaction. In this activity, we ask that you focus on specific elements of Sustained Shared Thinking, which are outlined below.\n\nRead the script of an interaction between a teacher (Saima) and a pupil (Pedro) that has taken place whilst the pupil built a tower block. Extend or amend Saima’s comments to include the following elements of Sustained Shared Thinking:\n\n- clarify ideas\n- use encouragement to extend thinking\n- suggest ideas\n- ask open questions\n- encourage pupils to respond in full sentences (although not included in Sustained Shared Thinking, this is a good way to develop pupils’ language)\n\nRecord what you would say in order to do this in your notebook. You will share and discuss your response with your mentor in your next meeting.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Scenario: Building a tower block</h3>\nPedro emptied the box of building blocks and sat down. He began to gather blocks\nand stack them on top of each other. Saima sat down next to him and began to observe\nwhat he was doing.\n\nPedro placed a small cube on the floor and then picked up a 3D semi-circle and balanced this on top. He then picked up another larger cube and tried to place this on top, but it fell down.\n\nSaima said, “Oh no, it fell down!”\n\nPedro began to build the tower again. He picked up the large cube this time and then placed the 3D semi-circle on top. He picked up a cuboid and tried to place this on top of the semi-circle, but the blocks fell down.\n\nSaima said, “Oh no, it fell down again.”\n\nPedro said, “I use this one now.”\n\nThis time Pedro started with the 3D semi-circle at the bottom and tried to place a cuboid on top. He did it carefully so that it balanced.\n\nSaima said, “Wow, that’s balancing.”\n\nPedro then placed another cube on top which stayed, and then another. He then reached for a large cube and placed this on top, but the tower fell.\n\nSaima said, “Oh no – silly big block. It made the tower fall down.”\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>What could Saima have said to:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>clarify ideas</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>use encouragement to extend the pupil’s thinking</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>suggest ideas</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>ask open questions</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>encourage the pupil to respond in full sentences</strong>\n    (although not included in Sustained Shared Thinking, this is a good way to develop\n    pupils’ language)\n  </li>\n</ul>\nExtend or amend Saima's comments and record them in your notebook. $CTA\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nFeedback\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThere are many ways Saima could have clarified ideas, extended Pedro’s thinking, suggested ideas, asked open questions or encouraged the use of full sentences.

When done well, it exposes pupils to high-utility language and extends their thinking. In your next mentor meeting, you will discuss your response with your mentor and practise using Sustained Shared Thinking.\n\n## Developing language in Primary and Secondary settings\n\nVocabulary in the English language is extremely complex; one word can carry many meanings which are context and subject specific. For example, the word ‘prime’ in Maths has a different meaning to the word ‘prime’ in English, which is why developing pupils’ disciplinary literacy is incredibly important. Pupils need to be explicitly taught the meaning of words in different contexts and subject disciplines. Therefore, _every_ teacher is responsible for developing pupils' literacy, including the teaching of vocabulary. This can be done by ensuring pupils have the opportunity to learn new words and explore ways to use familiar words in new contexts.\n\nVocabulary should be taught to pupils both implicitly, through modelling high-quality oral language, and explicitly, via the direct teaching of new words.\n\nWhen explicitly teaching new words, it is important that you do so in a meaningful way. If you provide pupils with a long list of words without attaching meaning to them, they are unlikely to understand or use those terms at a later stage (Quigley, 2019). Instead, to make words more memorable, you should help pupils to attach meaning to them. This can be done in many ways, but this session will focus on teaching the morphology (parts) and etymology (origins) of words.\n\n## Morphology\n\nMorphology is the study of the structure and parts of words. Words can be broken down into their parts (morphemes) and each carries a meaning. By asking pupils to study morphemes, you can help them to attach meaning to abstract words.\n\nThe common morphemes pupils will learn about are:\n\n- **root:** the primary part of a word which conveys most of a word’s meaning\n- **prefix:** a morpheme added before the root of a word\n- **suffix:** a morpheme added after the root of a word\n\nTeaching pupils the meaning of different roots, suffixes and prefixes enables them to expand their vocabulary repertoire significantly. They will also develop an understanding of word-building, which they can apply to other vocabulary. Understanding word building helps pupils to decode unfamiliar words when reading, as they can infer what the word might mean if they understand a part of it, such as the root, prefix or suffix.\n\nIn the primary setting, you might teach pupils that the prefix ‘in’ can mean ‘in’, ‘on’ or ‘not’. After teaching this, you might ask pupils to explore the prefix in different words such as, ‘inject’, ‘influx’ and ‘insane’.\n\nThis develops pupils’ receptive and expressive language, as they gain an understanding of what the prefix ‘in’ means and how to use it in their own speech.\n\nIn the Secondary setting, you might combine morphology with etymology.\n\n## Etymology\n\nEtymology is the study of the origin of words. Many academic, subject-specific words have Latin or Greek origins (Nagy and Townsend, 2012). Pupils may find them trickier to understand as they are less frequently encountered in everyday language. You can teach these abstract words by helping pupils to attach meaning to them. This can be done by teaching the origins of their constituent morphemes. The example below helps to illustrate this.\n\n### Example:\n\nTo help pupils understand what _photosynthesis_ means, you might teach them the morphology (photo-syn-thesis) and etymology (light-with-setting) of the word:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Etymology of the work photosynthesis: Photo means light, syn means with or together and thesis means setting, putting or placing. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Etymology-4.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 2: ‘The morphology of Photosynthesis’, taken from $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n## Teaching vocabulary in practice\n\nWhen teaching any vocabulary, it is helpful to ensure that it is related to the topic that pupils are learning about (Teaching and Learning Toolkit, 2015). Teaching word meanings at the start of a topic and revisiting them throughout means pupils are more likely to comprehend the content being taught during lessons. It also means they are regularly exposed to the vocabulary throughout the topic, making it more memorable. They can hear it being used in context and have multiple opportunities to apply it during speaking and listing, reading, and writing.\n\nThere are many ways that vocabulary can be explicitly and implicitly taught.

Listen to Liam Milne from St Anthony’s Academy as he discusses his approach to this:\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/umJqMRbwiLQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTeaching vocabulary – Liam Milne\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nDeveloping language and vocabulary is critical in a pupil’s ability to succeed across the curriculum. English is both a subject in its own right and often the medium for teaching within many lessons. As such, developing language and vocabulary has a profound effect on whether a pupil is able to access all areas of the curriculum. Without developing language and vocabulary in lessons, pupils can struggle to access content and even exam and assessment questions, so it is vital, when considering the impact it may have upon their attainment. In addition, it can give pupils more confidence to discuss topics and consequently deepen their knowledge.\n\nAt the beginning of a year I usually have around 30 key terms that my pupils need to learn in order to gain a deep understanding of the topics I teach in a year. I want them to be able to use this vocabulary both during discussions inside and outside of the classroom, and when answering assessed questions.\n\nI stagger the learning and application of these terms over the course of a unit. For example, in year 9 we teach a module on Judaism, so at the beginning this unit, the pupils are presented with 8 key terms which centre around Jewish festivals, rituals and places of worship.\n\nAt home, pupils are asked to revise and prepare to be tested on these key terms. Formative testing is used to strengthen recall and assess whether pupils have improved their understanding of the vocabulary. This usually takes the form of a basic quiz where I read the key terms and the pupils write down what they think the definition is.\n\nOnce pupils have mastered their knowledge and understanding of the key terms and definitions, I set formative exam questions which assess a pupil’s knowledge on a topic and their ability to apply key terms and definitions in their extended writing. I encourage pupils to use key vocabulary by making the link between using it and their attainment explicit. For example, in our Judaism module, pupils are aware that if they don’t use key Jewish terminology, they are unable to achieve the highest bands and the top marks.\n\nPupils are given verbal feedback on their exam essays and are encouraged to discuss the feedback given and how it could be implemented in their answers – giving them greater scope to use and apply subject specific terms, therefore building their vocabulary.\n\n‘Learning talk’ is also a powerful tool for building language and vocabulary and is something I regularly build into my lessons. ‘Learning talk’ is when pupils verbalise what they understand about certain terms, topics or issues.  For example, I have, in the past, placed the word ‘Synagogue’ or ‘Bar Mitzvah’ onto the white board and set a timer of three minutes, asking pupils to discuss what they know about these key terms and consider how these words link to their own lives. This gives pupils a chance to explore vocabulary in a safe space where they can share their ideas and learn from their peers, which helps to build their more general and subject specific vocabulary.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n**Now, think carefully about a topic you are teaching or are about to teach**. Choose to identify Tier 2 and/or Tier 3 vocabulary that needs to be taught to support learning.\n\n**Tier 2 vocabulary** - words that you could expose pupils to as part of a whole-school approach to developing language.\n\n**Tier 3 vocabulary** - subject specific words that pupils need to be explicitly taught to access the topic being taught.\n\nWhen trying to identify vocabulary to teach, it is important you consider the topic or material you are teaching. When reviewing the topic or material, try to identify words that:\n\n- Pupils _must_ know in order to understand the key concepts or material they encounter\n- Words that are unlikely to be in pupils’ background knowledge\n- Words that can’t easily be inferred\n\nIt may be helpful to talk to a colleague who has taught the topic or text before and can share their experience with you.\n\n$CTA\nRecord the vocabulary in your notebook. You will discuss when and how to teach this with your mentor during your next meeting and will be observed teaching vocabulary in the following mentor meeting.\n$CTA\n\nYou can use this [example of Tier 1, 2 and 3 vocabulary used in a year four English unit](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/09/Module-5-WE-Tier-2-and-3-vocabulary-template.docx) to support you if you wish.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.10 Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines.\n\n_3o.

Every teacher can develop pupils’ literacy skills, including their reading ability.\n\nTo support you to do this, in this session you will explore:\n\n- How do pupils learn to read?\n\n  - Word recognition\n  - Language comprehension\n\n- Engaging parents and carers\n\n- Developing writing\n\n## How do pupils learn to read?\n\nReading ability can pose a barrier to many pupils in accessing the curriculum. Therefore, in order to support all pupils to succeed, you should develop their ability to read so they can meaningfully engage with the curriculum.\n\nIn addition, disciplinary literacy recognises that reading skills are both general and subject specific (EEF, 2019). For example, the requirement to decode words is a general skill, whereas the requirement to consider the author and their context when the text was written is subject specific. In Biology, a pupil may read an informational text about photosynthesis and assume that it is an authoritative account, suppressing thoughts about the author, whereas, in the English classroom, a pupil could read with an active awareness of the author.\n\nTherefore, you should support pupils to develop their reading ability regardless of the phase or subject you teach. In order to do this successfully, you need to have a foundational understanding of how pupils learn to read.\n\n**The** **Simple View of Reading** identifies two main elements that are required when reading:\n\n- **Word recognition** – pupils being able to read or accurately decode words\n- **Language comprehension** – pupils' level of understanding of the text\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Diagram showing the relationship between decoding and language comprehension. Being at the bottom end of both scales results in poor word recognition and poor comprehension whilst being at the top end of each scale results in good word recognition and good comprehension. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/12/The-Simple-View-of-Reading-Updated.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 1: ‘The Simple View of Reading’ Adapted from $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nAs the graph illustrates, pupils with good decoding and good language comprehension are typically good readers. Therefore, a balanced approach to reading, which develops both word recognition and language comprehension, is essential for pupils to be able to read.\n\n$CTA\nOf course, reading is much more complex than simply decoding and comprehending; these two elements are made up of multiple strands. Listen to Ruth Everett, an English and Literacy consultant, talk in more detail about the Simple View of Reading and how it can help you develop your pupils’ literacy.

This makes the process of reading development quite challenging to understand. Therefore, The Simple View of Reading is a great place to start as it highlights two connected but separable strands: word recognition and language comprehension.\n\nSo what does word recognition and language comprehension entail?\n\nSimply put, word recognition is the ability to <em>read</em> individual words, whereas language comprehension is a process used to identify the <em>meaning</em> of written or spoken language.\n\nIn order to understand these two strands in a bit more detail, it is helpful to look at The Scarborough Reading Rope.\n\nThis diagram is useful to highlight the complex processes involved in both word recognition and language comprehension.\n\nWord recognition is comprised of three main elements. When reading, pupils will use sight recognition to read familiar words, which means they can read the word just by looking at it. However, when they come across unfamiliar words, they will need to decode them, which means breaking a word down into its sounds – also known as phonemes. In order to be able to do this, pupils need to have phonological awareness, which is why early reading is taught through phonics. A pupil with poor word recognition may struggle to sound out complex vocabulary.\n\nLanguage comprehension involves the integration of multiple sources of knowledge and skills. In order to comprehend a text, pupils need to have literacy knowledge, such as knowing to read text from left to right. They also need to understand the meaning of the vocabulary their reading, and the syntax, so they can make sense of words and sentences. Background knowledge of a topic is also important as this enables the reader or listener to verbally reason and to make inferences. All these components weave together to comprise effective language comprehension. A pupil with poor language comprehension may struggle to understand what a task is asking them to do or misinterpret key points in a text.\n\nHow can you develop pupils' reading?\n\nThe Simple View of Reading highlights the need for a balanced approach to supporting pupils to become fluent readers. Both word recognition and language comprehension need to be addressed. When supporting pupils to read, it is important that you are aware of the individual reading challenges your pupils face and what their next individual steps are to improve.\n\nThis is particularly important for pupils who are <em>struggling</em> with reading as they need to catch up with their peers. The Simple View of Reading can support you in targeting pupils who are behind. By assessing both word reading <em>and</em> comprehension, you can identify which components need targeted development.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Word recognition\n\nEarly reading should be taught using systematic phonics. Systematic phonics is part of the National Curriculum as it is underpinned by extensive research that shows it is the most effective way to teach pupils to read words (EEF, 2016).\n\nSystematic phonics should form part of a balanced approach to developing reading during Early Years and in Primary-aged children. If you are in the Secondary setting, you should be aware of how early reading is taught, so that you can support pupils to continue strategies they learnt in the Primary setting where necessary.\n\nTeaching phonics develops pupils’ phonemic awareness (the ability to hear individual speech sounds) and teaches pupils about the relationships between speech sounds and letter combinations. When applying phonics during reading, pupils will break up unfamiliar words into individual sounds (segmenting) and then put those sounds together (blending) to say the word.\n\nThis is a very effective way for pupils to decode unfamiliar words. However, not all words are phonetic. That means there are some words which can’t be broken down into individual sounds. Therefore, a part of teaching phonics involves explicitly teaching pupils these ‘tricky’ words, so that pupils recognise them from sight.\n\nTeaching phonics supports pupils with their reading and spelling, as it enables them to sound out a word as they write it.\n\nIf you wish, you can watch Sophie teaching phonics to year 2 pupils to see what it looks like in practice.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/TCpfviPQBco)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTeaching phonics - Reach Academy\nIf you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Teaching phonics - Reach Academy [AD]](https://youtu.be/vCcd9DErBqQ)\n\n### Summary\n\nPhonics helps pupils to read unfamiliar words, but word recognition is only a part of the skill of reading. Pupils need to be able to understand what they read, which is why it is important to develop their comprehension in any phase or subject.\n\n## Language comprehension\n\nA balanced approach comprising of teaching both phonics and comprehension should be taken when teaching pupils to read. For pupils to understand words and sentences that they have decoded, they need to have good comprehension, but how can you support this development as a teacher?\n\n## Comprehension strategies\n\nPrior knowledge and understanding key vocabulary are essential for pupils’ comprehension. However, they are not the only factors that are important. Pupils need to be able to monitor their understanding of a text as they read, ensuring they remain focused while processing the text.\n\nThere are some specific strategies that Early Years, Primary and Secondary pupils can be taught to monitor their comprehension and overcome potential barriers (Teaching and Learning Tool Kit, 2015). These strategies are (EEF, 2019):\n\n**Activating prior knowledge** – pupils think about what they already know about a topic, from reading or other experiences, and try to make links. This helps pupils to infer and elaborate, fill in missing or incomplete information, and use existing mental structures to support recall.\n\n- If reading Cosmic – a story where a boy finds himself in space – pupils might consider what they already know about space\n- If reading a text about Henry VIII, pupils might consider what they already know about life in Tudor times\n\n**Prediction** – pupils predict what might happen as a text is read. This causes them to pay close attention to the text, which means they can closely monitor their own comprehension.\n\n- If reading Chinye – a fairy-tale - pupils could predict what might happen to the character based on what they already know from the story, as well as what they know from similar stories\n- If reading about Migration in the UK, pupils might predict the impact of international migration on English seaside towns\n\n**Inference** – pupils infer the meaning of pictures or sentences from their context, and the meaning of words from spelling patterns.\n\n- If reading a poem about World War Two, pupils might infer what different similes or metaphors are describing\n- If reading Tuesday – a picture book – pupils might infer why the frogs are looking up to the sky\n\n**Questioning** – pupils generate their own questions about a text in order to check their comprehension.\n\n- If reading Oliver Twist, pupils might generate five key questions they hope to answer in the next chapter\n- If reading about an artist, pupils might generate five key questions they hope the text will answer\n\n**Clarifying** – pupils identify areas of uncertainty, which may be individual words or phrases, and seek information to clarify meaning.\n\n- Pupils might come across words they don’t know the meaning of and seek to find this out\n- If pupils are reading non-fiction, they might check that they understand any images or graphs that are presented alongside the text\n\n**Summarising** – pupils succinctly describe the meaning of sections of the text. This causes pupils to focus on the key content, which in turn supports comprehension monitoring.\n\n- After reading Little Red Riding Hood, pupils might tell their partner the key events that happened. A teacher might scaffold this using picture prompts\n- After reading a text on photosynthesis, pupils might write a summary of this process\n\n## Teaching comprehension strategies\n\nIt is important that pupils are explicitly taught these strategies. Detailed explanations and high-quality modelling, such as ‘Think Alouds’, should be used to teach pupils how to apply each strategy when reading. This helps to make the implicit strategies of a good reader explicit to pupils, providing them with techniques they can apply independently.\n\nBefore pupils are expected to apply these strategies independently, they must be given multiple opportunities to try out each one during guided practice, with a partner, or in a small group. Their independent use of these strategies should be built up gradually, until they are able to apply multiple strategies at once. The level of independence that pupils are expected to achieve when using these comprehension strategies will depend on the phase you are teaching, as well as any specific barriers to learning for a child.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Subject specific comprehension strategies</h3>\nThe five strategies outlined can be used on both fiction and non-fiction texts. However,\nthe subject does matter, especially in Secondary school. Therefore, it is important\nthat the model is adapted to suit the content you are teaching.\n\nFor example, the questions that pupils generate in English Literature might be related to character development or the mood generated by the author, whereas in P.E. the questions might be focused around physiological changes that happen to the body during exercise.\n\nYou might also include additional subject specific reading strategies. For example, in a History lesson, you might ask pupils to identify the source of the information they are reading or make notes on the context of when it was reported, such as the political climate.\n\nSupporting reading in your subject is vital, and therefore, it will form part of the focus of your next training session.\n$I\n\n## Engaging parents and carers\n\nTo help pupils develop their reading ability, it is important that they get as many opportunities to practise reading as possible. You can encourage pupils to utilise their time outside of school to develop their reading further. One way to do this is to engage parents, carers or families in their child’s reading development, which may increase the amount of time a pupil spends engaging with texts at home.\n\n$CTA\nListen to Kelly Challis discuss shared reading.

By helping to develop their child's literacy skills, parents and carers have the potential to improve outcomes for their children.\n\nThe Education Endowment Foundation – also known as the EEF – state that overall, there is consistent evidence that the level and quality of parental involvement in learning is linked to a child’s communication, language, and literacy capabilities, and supporting parents to help their children learn has the potential to improve outcomes.\n\nPromoting shared reading is one way to engage parents and carers in the education of their children. Research indicates there are benefits of reading to children <em>before</em> they can read themselves and reading <em>with</em> them when they do begin to read.\n\n<em> </em>What approaches are useful for parents?\n\nApproaches that focus on <em>how</em> to read effectively with children appear to be more successful than those which focus more broadly on the promotion of reading or on the provision of books according to the EEF.\n\nIt might be helpful to share with parents that successful reading is made up of many processes, which can be categorised into two strands: word recognition and language comprehension. There are also reading strategies that you can share with parents to support their child’s reading development.\n\nFirstly, you can encourage them to ask a range of questions about the book to check for understanding, such as:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Asking questions using the five W’s - who, what, where, when and why.</li>\n  <li>Asking a mixture of closed and open questions.</li>\n  <li>\n    Asking about and discussing the meaning of vocabulary - what does that mean?\n    When else might you use that word?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Asking their children to <em>summarise</em> what has happened so far and{\" \"}\n    <em>predict </em>what might happen next.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nSecondly, you can encourage them to support their children to see links between what\nthey are reading and the real world. This can help children develop their understanding\nof ideas in the book itself. For example, while reading about Cinderella going to\nthe ball, a parent might discuss the similarities between a ball and a birthday party.\n\nYou can share these strategies with parents and carers and encourage them to read with their children at home by proactively seeking out interactions during the school day, at drop off or collection, or, if you don’t see parents regularly, then you can use parents evening as a good opportunity to talk to them about the importance of their children reading at home and provide them with approaches to do so.\n\nAll children can benefit from shared reading regardless of their age or reading ability. Sharing stories can stretch a child’s understanding of the world, fuel their imagination and expose them to a more sophisticated range of vocabulary and language structures which may not always be available to them in the books they can read alone.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nAs Kelly said, there are strategies that you can share with parents or carers to support them when reading with their children at home. In addition to this, it is important that you promote reading for pleasure to both your pupils and their parents or carers. You can do this in the classroom by reading a range of high-quality texts to pupils.\n\n### Building relationships\n\nAnother benefit to engaging parents and carers in their child’s reading development is that it creates an opportunity for you to build effective relationships with them. This can improve a pupil’s motivation, behaviour and academic success.\n\nOne way to do this is by sharing children’s reading successes with their parents. For example, if you have been working with a parent to improve their child’s reading, or if reading is their child’s area of development, you could seek an opportunity to speak to parents/carers or send home a message in a journal to inform them of their child’s achievements. The message could say something like “Zack tried really hard to sound out the words ‘elements’ and ‘atomic’ in his science lesson today. He is working hard and making good progress in his reading.”\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nConsider the following questions and record your response in your notebook:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How do you currently engage parents in their child’s learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What more could you do?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nEvery school will have different policies on how to engage parents and how to support\nreading at home, so this is something you should consult with your mentor about in\nyour next session. $CTA\n\n## Developing writing\n\nIt is important that you invest time in developing pupils’ literacy skills in the phase or subject that you teach as part of a whole school approach to literacy.\n\n$CTA\nIn your next training session, you will explore how to teach comprehension and how to support pupils’ writing in your phase or subject. In order to prepare for the session, listen to Ruth Everett and answer the following questions in your notebook:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">\n      Why is writing challenging?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How can you support pupils’ writing?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/BqeeTUMwvMU)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nTeaching writing – Ruth Everett\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nPupils need to master many different forms of writing across the curriculum in all key stages.\n\nIn upper key stage 2, there is an increased focus on <em>expository</em> writing. This is writing that is used to explain, describe or inform, for example essays, newspaper articles, and instruction manuals.\n\nIn key stages 3 and 4, disciplinary writing instruction should be seen as inseparable from the teaching of the actual curriculum. So, there needs to be a focus on helping pupils develop a systematic way in which their writing responds to the questions posed in specific subjects.\n\nFor example, how a pupil might respond with the use of prose in history contrasts to the demands of science where pupils need to answer more succinctly using bullet points. Each approach requires development over time so that pupils can demonstrate their knowledge using the different writing approaches.\n\nGiven the importance of writing across the curriculum, it is essential that all teachers, regardless of phase and subject, are teachers of writing.\n\n<strong>But what makes writing so challenging?</strong>\n\nDavid McCullough, two-time Pulitzer prize winner, explains why writing poses challenges for pupils. He says, <em>“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.” </em>\n\nAs in reading, there are many <strong>components </strong>which must be explicitly taught if a pupil is to become an effective <strong>writer</strong>, including <em>handwriting, punctuation, spelling, word choices, paragraphing, imagery, word inferences. </em>\n\nTherefore, you need to break down the basics of writing instruction into <strong>smaller chunks</strong>. Too often, pupils are expected to tackle more complex tasks, like writing an essay, before they have all the knowledge they require, resulting in an overload of their working memory. The impact of this is the pupil’s effort is not focused on the content of the lesson, but on the structure and organisation of the piece of writing. To prevent this, you can scaffold the structure so teaching the content becomes the primary focus.\n\nHow you scaffold writing is likely to be subject specific. For example, an Art teacher might explicitly model the skill of writing detailed <strong>annotations</strong> of sketches, whereas a science teacher might model how to write an effective conclusion including Tier 3 vocabulary, or an English teacher might model how to use a <strong>non-finite verb</strong> after a quotation to clarify understanding and develop a learner’s analytical skills.\n\nTherefore, pupils should be taught how to write for different purposes and be given a significant amount of time to practise these domain-specific writing skills.\n\n<strong>How can you teach effective writing?</strong>\n\nPupils need to understand that writing is a <strong>process</strong> not a singular activity. A good piece of writing is <strong>planned, drafted and edited</strong>. These stages are best taught using explicit teaching methods such as <strong>modelling</strong> <strong>whilst thinking aloud</strong>. To effectively model the writing process, you need to use high-quality, clear and succinct oral language.\n\nTherefore, it is helpful to plan, script and even rehearse what you will say when modelling.\n\n<strong>Why is modelling so important when teaching writing?</strong>\n\nModelling and thinking aloud helps you to articulate some of the meta-cognitive approaches that happen automatically for you, and for some pupils, but not for all. Talking through your thought processes makes discrete steps explicit so pupils can understand the steps they need to take throughout the writing process.\n\nWorking with colleagues is a great way to practise modelling, so you can become adept at this important but quite difficult skill.\n\nAnother evidence-based strategy you can use when modelling is to provide pupils with a worked example on a visualiser or Interactive Whiteboard. This could be one of their peer’s successful pieces of writing. You can then highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the whole text, for example, <em>vocabulary, a subordinate clause, an effective topic sentence</em>. This way, the successful elements are labelled by deconstructing the text into its building blocks. Pupils can then see:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>how</strong> a good piece of writing is created\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    and <strong>what</strong> the features are of an effective written piece.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nIt is important to pitch this right to inspire rather than dishearten.\n\nIn summary, writing is a complex process, comprised of <em>three </em>main phases: <strong>planning, drafting </strong>and <strong>editing</strong>. <em>Each</em> phase needs to be explicitly taught by all teachers and broken down into chunks to avoid over burdening learners’ working memories. All too often, the most important phases - planning and editing - are only taught as a one-off activity.\n\nYou should embed writing instruction into the <strong>content</strong> of your curriculum and focus writing activities on what pupils are currently learning and reading about to ensure they have the prior knowledge required to successfully complete the written task.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nIn your next mentor meeting, you will be observed teaching the Tier 2 and/or 3 vocabulary that you identified and planned to teach in your last mentor meeting.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### High expectations\n\n_1d.

They each come to school with a variety of different life experiences, prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning. Therefore, the pupils you teach are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support. Adaptive teaching can help you support all pupils to succeed.\n\nIn this session, you will explore:\n\n- High-quality teaching\n- Adaptive teaching\n- Developing knowledge through pre-teaching\n\n## High-quality teaching\n\nThe first step to supporting all pupils to succeed is ensuring they have access to high-quality teaching. This is sometimes known as Quality First Teaching. High-quality teaching is beneficial for all pupils, not just those who may have additional learning needs.\n\nWhat strategies do you think would be considered high-quality teaching?\n\n{button}[Take the quiz](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/5-how-can-you-support-all-pupils-to-succeed/5-the-send-code-of-practice-30-minutes/module-5-session-3-further-developing-prior-knowledge/){/button}\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nFeedback\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nAll the strategies would be considered as high-quality teaching.\n\nYou may recognise the strategies above as they have been covered earlier in the programme. The strategies listed are just some of the areas that would be considered high-quality teaching - there are many more. The first step in supporting all pupils to achieve success is to develop your teaching practice so that you consistently deliver high-quality teaching. As the English SEND Code of Practice states:\n\n<blockquote>\n  High-quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the starting\n  point in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN. Additional\n  intervention and SEN support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality\n  teaching.\n  <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Department for Education, 2014)</span>\n</blockquote>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nAn important part of high-quality teaching is seeking to understand your pupils’ differences, including different levels of prior knowledge and barriers to learning, and then being responsive to those needs. This can be done through adaptive teaching.\n\n## Adaptive teaching\n\nAdaptive teaching means being responsive to learners' needs. This includes providing further challenge to stretch pupils’ learning and providing additional support and scaffold to support pupils who are struggling. There are many ways you can adapt your teaching, but this is less likely to be valuable if it causes you to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or set lower expectations for particular pupils. Adapting your teaching should be done in a meaningful way that will have a positive impact on pupils’ learning.\n\n$CTA\nListen and make notes as Katherine Fas talks about how she has prepared for and implemented adaptive teaching.

Looking at the national curriculum or progression maps informed me of what pupils will have already covered in other year groups that link to the topic I was about to teach. This supported me in pitching the sequence of lessons correctly as it helped to identify what existing skills I could build upon.\n\nThe next step was to use any available information I had that could tell me what the children’s learning needs would be in this area and more generally. Knowing my pupils was key here. Sometimes, I would give pupils a task to assess their confidence and competence in the given subject, and other times I would use information that I already knew about the children to identify who might require additional support. Before teaching a topic, I would identify a selection of children to deliver a pre-teaching session to. These children would be pupils who lacked critical prior knowledge or required content to be further broken down. Pre-teaching would allow them to be at a similar starting point to their peers when new material was introduced to the whole class. One of the main things I focused on in these sessions was the vocabulary I would be covering in the topic. Research has found that many gaps in attainment can be linked to vocabulary comprehension and when these gaps are narrowed, pupils have a much greater chance of success.\n\nDuring the lessons themselves, I ensured I made use of well-designed resources to ensure the learners were supported to achieve the learning goal. I also found it really useful to give myself and any other additional adult a specific role in the lessons by working with a target group to either provide additional support or challenge to pupils. I would often start by working with the pupils that received pre-teaching, to ensure they were supported in embedding the content I delivered into practice. However, I would always ensure that these target groups were not static and built a culture of acceptance by reinforcing that these groups were fluid and any child could be in them at any given time.\n\nHow did I know which pupils to work with during a lesson?\n\nI used a variety of formative assessment strategies, such as questioning, throughout the lesson to ensure that myself, my teaching assistant and the pupils themselves were aware of the progress they were making against the success criteria. This way, at any point in the lesson, I could shift my focus to a different target group. For example, if pupils I supported at the beginning of the lesson gained confidence, I could work with children who faced a different barrier in their learning. A particularly good strategy I have found when it comes to assessing who might need further support is the use of hinge questions. These questions quickly and effectively informed me and the learners of how well they understood something at a point in the lesson when a quick intervention could be implemented to support pupils to succeed in their next steps.\n\nTowards the end of the lesson, I always found it useful for the children to self-assess against the learning goal by placing their books in colour coded trays. I personally used a traffic-light system, where green was used if they felt ready to go, amber if they were almost there and red if they were unsure. Generally, due to the work that had been done in the lesson to ensure pupils were on-track, there were few children who were left completely in the dark, but it still happens and it’s important for pupils to ensure they feel confident at sharing this!\n\nAsking pupils to self-assess throughout, but especially towards the end of the lesson, helped me to prioritise my marking and feedback. Reading through the work and identifying common misconceptions present in groups of pupils helped to plan how I would group pupils in the next lesson.\n\nIn summary, the 5 greatest tools for me in adapting my lessons for the learners were:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Knowing the children inside and out!</li>\n  <li>Prioritising assessment opportunities throughout the lessons</li>\n  <li>Planning for questioning that will support and extend</li>\n  <li>Ensuring a fluid group structure</li>\n  <li>\n    Using marking and feedback opportunities effectively and consistently,\n    ensuring that these are built into lesson and classroom culture\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\nIn your notebook, list at least four strategies that Katherine uses to adapt her teaching.\n$CTA\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nFeedback\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThere are many ways that you can prepare for adaptive teaching, but the areas that Katherine talks about are listed below.

In module 2, you explored the importance of considering prior knowledge when planning how much information to introduce. In module 3, you explored how to support pupils to activate or draw upon prior knowledge when working independently by modelling using ‘Think Aloud’. In module 4, you explored how to use assessment to check for prior knowledge and identify possible misconceptions. In this session, you will explore how to develop pupils’ prior knowledge through pre-teaching.\n\nPrior knowledge is important for learning for all pupils but especially those with additional learning needs because:\n\n- **It reduces working memory load** – pre-teaching enables the teacher to further break content down into smaller steps which helps prevent working memory overload.\n- **New knowledge is learnt by attaching to existing knowledge** – if pupils don’t have any knowledge of the material being taught, it is much harder for them to process and remember new information.\n\nTherefore, pupils with poor prior knowledge are at risk from being unable to access the material you are teaching.\n\n### How do you identify pupils who require pre-teaching?\n\nBefore you teach a topic, it is important that you assess a pupil’s prior knowledge and current understanding. As Katherine suggests in her video, this can be done by considering what pupils have already covered earlier on in the curriculum. However, just because pupils have been taught something, it does not mean they have retained that knowledge. We know from our understanding of how pupils learn that information needs to be revisited in order to be retained. Therefore, you should be careful when making assumptions about pupils’ prior knowledge and, where possible, assess pupils’ current level of understanding in a topic. This will help you to identify which pupils require pre-teaching before a topic or lesson.\n\nOften, you will already know which pupils will benefit from pre-teaching based on your understanding of your pupils and your experience of working with them throughout the academic year.\n\n### Using pre-teaching to develop prior knowledge\n\nPupils' prior knowledge can be developed in a variety of ways, but this session will focus on pre-teaching. Pre-teaching is when pupils are taught key information prior to it being taught in a lesson. Pre-teaching provides pupils with essential foundational knowledge that they can draw upon during a lesson. This is likely to increase the pupils’ attention, focus and motivation.\n\n## Identifying material to pre-teach\n\nWhen identifying what material to pre-teach, you will need to have secure subject knowledge and a good understanding of pupils’ needs. Therefore, it can be helpful to work with colleagues such as a subject or phase lead and your Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo).\n\nWhen planning content to pre-teach, you should follow the same principles as you would when planning explanations during a lesson. Information should be broken down into small chunks and made memorable to avoid working memory overload. Pre-teaching should be an extension of the teaching sequence, breaking down the foundational knowledge into even smaller steps. Therefore, key vocabulary or facts that will be present during the lesson can be a good focus for a pre-teaching session. The example below demonstrates what this might look like in practice.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\nIf teaching a lesson on the Ancient Egyptians, the key vocabulary or facts that might\nbe identified for pre-teaching are:\n<ul>\n  <li>Egypt</li>\n  <li>Ancient Egyptians</li>\n  <li>Tomb</li>\n  <li>Tutankhamun</li>\n  <li>Pyramid</li>\n  <li>Hieroglyphics</li>\n  <li>Shaduf</li>\n</ul>\nFor best effect, the words above should be accompanied with a graphical representation\nto support pupil understanding. $I\n\n## What might a pre-teaching session entail?\n\nThe aim of any pre-teaching session is to teach pupils key information that will help them to access the material being taught in the classroom.\n\nThere are many ways that a pre-teaching session might run in school and it will be up to you to decide what is best for your pupils based on their needs and the material being taught. There is no one size fits all. You will need to decide on the number of pupils to include in the pre-teaching session, how long the session should run for, and how regular the sessions should be. You will also need to consider how the session should be delivered. It would be beneficial to work closely with your SENCo and other special education professionals to support you in making these decisions.\n\nBelow is one example of how a teacher could run a pre-teaching session:\n\n$I\nAdam, a class teacher, is about to begin a new topic on Ancient Egyptians. Through assessment and his understanding of pupils’ needs within his class, he identifies 4 pupils who would benefit from pre-teaching.\n\nHe looks at the first lesson he will teach and identifies key subject-specific vocabulary that will be present in the lesson. He knows that he must be selective with which vocabulary to choose - he doesn’t want to choose too many words and overload pupils’ working memory. As a result, he chooses five words that he believes the pupils will be least familiar with and which will appear most frequently.\n\nHe plans to run a ten-minute session to teach pupils the key vocabulary. During the session, he begins by explaining the vocabulary with the use of pictures, actions and non-examples (where appropriate) and asks probing questions to check understanding. He then presents one word to the group and asks them to share what it means with their partner. He works his way through the remaining vocabulary and provides corrective or affirmative feedback to pupils.\n$I\n\nIn this example, the teacher is delivering the session. However, if you have additional adults available, they may be able to run the session provided you give them the correct resources and information that they need. If you don’t feel as though you have the available time and don’t have an additional adult to support with pre-teaching, the resource could be sent home with pupils. Parents or carers can work with their child to pre-teach material ahead of the lesson.\n\nWorking closely with parents and carers is very important when supporting all pupils to succeed and is something that will be explored in later sessions.\n\n## Application to practice\n\n$CTA\nIn this activity, you will begin to plan how you can support pupils who have different levels of prior knowledge to access a lesson you will soon teach. Draft a plan for a pre-teaching session to be delivered in school by yourself or by an additional adult, or to be sent home for parents or carers to deliver.\n\nUse the following points to help you when planning:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Identify the next lesson or topic where you think pupils will benefit from\n    pre-teaching\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Identify pupil(s) who will benefit from pre-teaching either based on their\n    prior knowledge or your understanding of their needs\n  </li>\n  <li>Identify key vocabulary or facts to include in the session</li>\n  <li>\n    Plan how you, an additional adult or a parent or carer will deliver the\n    session\n  </li>\n  <li>Make use of existing well-designed resources where possible</li>\n</ul>\nYou will share this with your mentor in your next meeting and this will be the practice\nfocus. $CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Adaptive teaching\n\n5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.\n\n5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.\n\n5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.\n\n5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.\n\n_5a.

It can be used to both assess and extend pupil understanding. Very skilled teachers will develop pupil understanding by adapting questions to suit learners’ needs either by providing further prompts to help break problems down or further stretch by asking follow-up questions. In order to do this successfully, teachers will use a variety of open and closed questions to guide pupils’ thinking.\n\nIn module 3, you covered a variety of questions styles that extend pupils' understanding but how can you adapt your questioning to support pupils who don’t give the correct answer?\n\nIf a pupil provides an incorrect answer, there are a number of things you can do to support their understanding:\n\n- Reframe the question to simplify it, possibly changing it from an open to a closed question\n- Break the answer/process down into smaller steps by asking more questions\n- Ensure you provide enough wait time between your question and a pupil’s response to allow them to process your question and think of their answer\n\nLook at the two examples below. One is of a teacher’s response to a pupil who gives the correct answer and the other is of a teacher’s response to a pupil who gives an incorrect answer. Compare them to see how the teacher reframes and adapts their questioning to stretch pupil understanding or provide greater scaffold.\n\n$I\n\n<strong>Response to a correct answer:</strong>\nTeacher: What is 103 x 5?

However, when marking their work after the lesson, it became clear that a small group of pupils needed additional practice around <strong>adding mixed number fractions </strong>as they’d struggled to complete the task successfully when working on their own.\n\nThey were able to do the work while I was working with them in the classroom and offering prompts, but I identified they had struggled to apply this knowledge when left to work independently.\n\nI wanted to address this as soon as possible, so I asked my classroom assistant to practice this skill with the pupils <strong>immediately after lunch</strong> <strong>the same day</strong>.  I ensured the practice activity focused on exactly the same skill that the we had been working on in class. After gathering feedback from my classroom assistant, it was clear that the pupils would require additional practice to consolidate their learning. As a result of this, I ensured that in the next maths lesson this small group would begin by working on more fluency examples before progressing to a reasoning activity, which the rest of the class were working on. I closely monitored their work so I could provide affirmative or corrective feedback immediately to ensure they didn’t learn or embed misconceptions.\n\nTo consolidate learning, I know that pupils need regular practice to build up retrieval strength of the material they are learning about. Therefore, I included a question that required pupils to <strong>add mixed number fractions </strong>in the daily arithmetic practice <strong>for the rest of that week.</strong> <strong>In our school, daily arithmetic is something that the children complete when they come into class every morning.</strong> I found that a 'little and often' approach is an effective way of incorporating additional practice in any area rather than overwhelming the pupils with lots of examples that they might see as ‘extra work’.\n\nAs further additional practice, I offered short lunchtime booster sessions, usually 5-10 minutes long, which pupils could attend if they felt they needed more practice. I was able to sit with the pupils in a more informal way and go back through their work to address misunderstanding and consolidate their learning.\n\nThe variety of additional practice provided had a really positive impact on pupils' learning. By completing the same types of questions daily, the pupils are given the chance to repeat and embed their knowledge and understanding.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script – Additional practice, Secondary\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nPlate tectonics and their associated hazards can be a very tricky concept for pupils to learn and understand. Because of this, I plan to teach the concept spaced throughout the curriculum, each time revisiting and building on what was previously covered. Sometimes re-teaching is required when assessment indicates a lack of understanding of foundational knowledge.\n\nIn the case of plate tectonics, the concept is revisited and practised using different examples, situations and contexts. This interleaving and spacing of threshold concepts is planned into the medium-term plan to ensure pupils get the opportunity to revisit and practice material they have previously covered.\n\nIn this case the pupils had already studied plate tectonics twice, looking at plate movement and the formation of the Himalayas and then at a later date looking at the destructive plate margin of Monserrat. This time the plate boundaries are covered again looking at the similarities and differences of each boundary and their resultant features; this allows additional practice of the concepts already learnt but in a different context. However, key language is kept the same to support recall of key information and to help pupils attach new information to their existing schema.\n\nI find that retrieval practice of threshold geographical concepts helps pupils remember fundamental information. It also allows pupils to see the wider picture of how different topics in geography are connected and relevant to one another. Knowing which topics will require additional practice before a lesson is taught is vital in ensuring additional practice opportunities are planned in. As a result, good subject knowledge is paramount.\n\nI also find that question-level analysis after key assessments is a fundamental tool when planning for additional practice as it helps to identify areas where there is a lack of understanding or misconceptions. This information is then used to plan future lessons. This could be to reteach a concept or interleave a key skill in future lessons.\n\nThe impact of this reflective system of practice is that no pupils are ‘left behind’ and therefore can continue to deepen their understanding of the key concepts.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nIn your next mentor meeting, you will be observed adapting your teaching to respond to pupils’ needs and subsequent practice will focus on this.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Classroom practice\n\n4.6 Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.\n\n4.10 How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.\n\n4.11 Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.\n\n_4n.

The SEND Code of Practice has been developed to support you to teach pupils who may require additional provision.\n\nIn this session, you will develop your understanding of the SEND Code of Practice by exploring:\n\n- The SEND Code of Practice\n- The graduated approach\n\n## The SEND Code of Practice\n\nAs you have seen in previous sessions, adapting your teaching practice to support all pupils to succeed does not necessarily mean an increase in workload. The strategies that have been covered so far in this module are all features of effective high-quality teaching. By mastering the use of these methods (e.g. effective scaffolding, deployment of support staff, and flexible grouping) you will be supporting most of your pupils to succeed at a task.\n\nBuilding these strategies into your everyday practice should be the first step taken to support all pupils to succeed. However, there will be a small number of your pupils for whom these strategies need to be developed further.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why a pupil may require further adaptation to practice. For example, it may be permanent adaptation; to support a pupil with a hearing impairment you may learn key signs or wear a microphone. Alternatively, the adaptation may only be required at a specific point in their education, such as the supporting of the emotional health and wellbeing of a pupil whose parents are separating.\n\nPupils with SEND may need a more personalised level of adaptive practice in order to access and achieve in all areas of the curriculum. [The SEND Code of Practice (2014)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/398815/SEND_Code_of_Practice_January_2015.pdf) is a document that supports teachers and leaders to understand their responsibilities and duty of care towards pupils with a special educational need. The Code of Practice itself is 292 pages long, so how can it be used by teachers to help inform their practice? Hear from Kenny Wheeler, from the Driver Youth Trust, as he highlights key points from the document that every teacher should be aware of.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/6cdDHLcx6Nc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nThe SEND Code of Practice – Kenny Wheeler\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWhat is the SEND Code of Practice?\n\nThe 'SEND Code of Practice: 0 to 25 years' (revised January 2015) explains the duties of local authorities, health bodies, schools and colleges to provide for those with special educational needs under part 3 of the Children and Families Act 2014.\n\nIn total, the SEND Code of Practice is 292 pages long. So how can it be used by teachers to help inform their practice?\n\nKey parts for educational settings relate to chapters 5, 6 and 7:\n\nChapter 5 outlines expectations for Early Years settings such as nurseries. Chapter 6 outlines expectations for schools, this includes identifying SEND, describing the four broad areas of need and special educational provision in schools, including SEN support and requests for EHCPs, as well as how schools will work with pupils, parents and external agencies. This chapter also details what should be included in the schools SEN Information Report and details the role of the SENCo. Chapter 7 outlines statutory duties in post-16 institutions.\n\nThe four broad areas of need (chapters 6.28 to 6.35) is helpful as it outlines some of the barriers some pupils may experience in the learning environment.\n\nThe broad areas of need are:\n\n<strong>Communication and interaction</strong> – this is where a pupil has speech,\nlanguage and communication needs. For example, they may have difficulty communicating\nwhat they mean or understanding the rules of social communication. There may also\nbe some issues relating to social interaction and they may not be able to understand\nthe needs of others.\n\n<strong>Cognition and learning</strong> – this is where young people learn at a slower\npace than their peers. Young people might have a moderate, mild or severe learning\ndifficulty which impacts on them accessing the curriculum. This extends to profound\nand multiple learning difficulties – also known as PMLD - where young people experience\nprofound barriers to accessing the curriculum if there aren’t significant adaptations\nmade to the lesson or additional resources provided.\n\n<strong>Social, emotional and mental health barriers</strong> – this is where young\npeople experience social and emotional challenges which can manifest in a multitude\nof ways. For example, some behaviours may be disruptive and attention-seeking whilst\nothers might be more withdrawn. Some behaviours may reflect underlying mental health\nbarriers such as depression or anxiety.\n\n<strong>Sensory and/or physical needs</strong> – this is where young people have\na disability which impacts on them accessing educational provision provided for them.\nThis may include a hearing impairment or visual impairment resulting in the young\nperson requiring additional resources or support to access the curriculum. It may\nalso be the case that a young person has a physical disability which again requires\nadditional resources or support to help them access educational provision.\n\nAn important consideration for you, as their teacher, relates to the steps you take in order to deliver high-quality teaching. Part of this involves identifying barriers that pupils may experience and considering how these will influence planning, use of resources, style of delivery and general interaction with pupils.\n\nIn part, the Code of Practice encourages teachers to take a step back and consider the information that already exists. Essentially, you are not starting with a blank page, there will be data and other key information that can support you in adjusting your approach to help pupils access the curriculum. For example:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Primary schools will have the Early Years profile to draw on and gauge the\n    areas of development for a pupil. There will also be information from the\n    phonics screening as well as internal assessments which show a learner’s\n    profile.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Secondary schools will have data and information from feeder Primary schools\n    as well as that produced by the assessments, they run such as CAT scores,\n    reading assessments and again, they will have their own in-house assessment\n    systems that they can draw information from.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nThere may also be additional information by way of reports from specialists which\ndetail where an individual’s relative strengths and weaknesses lie.\n\nParents will also be an invaluable source of information relating to their child. They will be able to share their own observations, insights and experiences of their child’s development. This insight might also include strategies and approaches that work as well as highlighting key areas of difficulty so make sure you invest time in communicating with them to involve them in the process.\n\nThe Code of Practice encourages a consultative approach which can help support you to gather information from a range of sources and then synthesise this information with the support of other key stakeholders such as parents, colleagues and external professionals. Rather than be data-rich and limited with analysis, the Code of Practice encourages you to be reflective, to make sense of the information to hand and use it to inform your teaching.\n\nEqually, the Code of Practice highlights that classroom teaching is effectively the first line of intervention or support, so before seeking to place a pupil on a provision that is different from or additional to normal provision, you should aim to understand what is going on in the classroom first of all. Only once you have a clearer understanding of what is happening within the classroom and have gathered evidence of what is working and where barriers persist, can you then really make more informed decisions of what would constitute the most appropriate provision in the future.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n### Four broad areas of need\n\nAs mentioned in the video, the Code of Practice highlights four broad areas of need. These are:\n\n- **Communication and interaction needs** such as Asperger’s Syndrome\n- **Cognition and learning needs** such as dyslexia\n- **Social, emotional and mental health difficulties** such as an attachment disorder\n- **Sensory or physical needs** such as visual impairment\n\nIt is useful to know which of the broad areas of need your pupil’s diagnosis falls into, as it can then help you with the identification of strategies to support you in adapting your practice.\n\nAny SEND reporting will ask for the pupil’s ‘primary’ area of need. However, it is highly likely that a pupil may have learning needs that fall into more than one of the broad areas so this should be considered when planning any support.\n\n## The graduated approach\n\nWhen supporting pupils with SEND to access the curriculum, the Code of Practice recommends adopting a graduated approach to your practice. This approach helps you to find out what strategies will support pupils to access their learning, and crucially, which strategies aren’t working for them. It involves working with many different stakeholders such as the pupil themselves, parents or careers, outside agencies and very importantly, the SENCo at your school. The extent to which these stakeholders are involved will depend on the pupils’ needs. The graduated approach can be used to support any pupil who requires more personalised adaptions in order to access learning; they do not have to be diagnosed with SEN.\n\nThe graduated approach consists of four stages: **assess, plan, do, review**. It is designed to put the pupil at the centre, and each stage supports the teacher to make adaptations to their learning environment or practice to better support the individual pupil.\n\nThe cycle is continuous and can span a short period of time (around 2 weeks) or can be used over a longer period (over a half-term). As such, it enables the teacher to be responsive to what is working well, and to stop actions that aren’t having the desired impact.\n\n$Figure\n$Alt The pupil works through the graduated approach in a cycle, moving from Assess to Plan, Do and Review. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Graduated-Approach-2.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nEach stage of the approach is outlined in the Code of Practice. However, listen again to Kenny Wheeler as he explains each step of the approach with some tangible examples.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/p2UTcJjjbP0)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nThe graduated approach – Kenny Wheeler\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nChapter 6.44 to Chapter 6.56 of the Code of Practice highlights the graduated approach that teachers can take in order to find out what may help a pupil and what might not help them.\n\nFrom the outset it is worth stating that we are looking at the behaviours exhibited or experienced by the individual. We are observing where difficulties occur and how they manifest or impact on the individual accessing the curriculum. What we are not doing is trying to diagnose or label an individual as having a learning difficulty. At the initial stage of the graduated approach we are collecting evidence and then using this to help inform future practices, approaches and strategies that we might use with an individual.\n\nAlthough we are referencing the SEND Code of Practice, good practice dictates that we review where a pupil is performing and look at what we can do to assist them in accessing learning within the classroom. This does not mean that we are saying that the individual has SEND; it is more a case of looking to see what works, what doesn’t, and what needs revising.\n\nThe first stage of the graduated approach is '<strong>assess</strong>'.\n\nAt this point we are gathering / collating the evidence we have to hand; this might be from:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>our own observations within the classroom or around the school</li>\n  <li>assessments that we may have carried out</li>\n  <li>\n    assessments from other members of staff such as previous class teachers or\n    teaching assistants\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    paperwork that may have been shared by the SENCo (also look on the shared\n    area where info is often stored)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    the pupil themselves describing where they feel they experience difficulties\n    but also where they feel they have relative strengths\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    we might seek views from parents (although this could come later on once you\n    have more information and a clearer idea of what we feel the issues actually\n    are)\n  </li>\n</ul>\nWhat is the issue? What are your concerns relating to the pupil, what is it that\nyou have noticed within the classroom? What behaviours are we seeing? We are looking\nto gather evidence, we are not looking to come up with a diagnosis – that might come\nin a subsequent assess, plan, do and review cycle and would be the carried out with\nthe involvement of outside professionals.\n\nThen we are looking to '<strong>plan</strong>'.\n\nKnowing what you feel the issue may be, the next step is considering what you need to do in order to help the pupil access the curriculum and engage with learning activities within the classroom.\n\nThings we might do at this stage could be:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Modelling tasks and making each step explicit for the pupil</li>\n  <li>Having worksheets to look at rather than working from the board</li>\n  <li>Giving pupils additional processing time</li>\n  <li>Providing scaffolds to support writing or independent tasks</li>\n</ul>\nThese plans need to be shared so that all staff adopt a consistent approach. For\nsome of you that might be talking with teaching assistants so that they complement\nwhat you are doing.\n\nThen we move on to the '<strong>do</strong>' part of the cycle, putting into action what you have planned, trying out different approaches and seeing their impact. Most importantly, doing something rather than waiting for someone else to take responsibility.\n\nThe final part of the cylce is '<strong>review</strong>'.\n\nWhat did you notice? What have other staff noticed?\n\nWhat was the impact of specific approaches you used?\n\nWhat worked and what didn’t work?\n\nIn what situation or context did the approach work / not work?\n\nHow did different approaches impact on the pupil accessing the curriculum and the progress they made?\n\nWhat does the pupil feel about the different approaches that are being used with them?\n\nHow does this information help us in having a clearer idea of where a pupil may be experiencing difficulties? What do we now know that we previously were not aware of? So with our newfound knowledge and understanding of the pupil, what would we do differently?\n\nWe can then start again, but we now have more information at the assess stage because we have our findings from our first cycle. It may be the case that if difficulties persist then after our own initial cycle, we may then go through the cycle again and involve other stakeholders such as the SENCo, parents, pupil, other professionals more intensively.\n\nThe more we know about a pupil then the more we can do to support the pupil by making adjustments to our practices, give strategies to the pupil and help ensure that all staff adopt a consistent approach to working with the pupil.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\nWhen supporting pupils with additional learning needs, it’s important that you don’t feel alone. You have the right to support from other staff in your school such as your SENCo and/or members of the senior leadership team. As indicated in the [EEF’s guidance report (2020)](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Send/EEF_Special_Educational_Needs_in_Mainstream_Schools_Guidance_Report.pdf), support is most effective when a holistic approach is taken to assess, plan, do and review.\n\n## The graduated approach: activity\n\nWatch the video below to hear from Kelly Challis from the Driver Youth Trust, as she explains how she uses the graduated approach to adapt her learning environment and practice to support pupils with dyslexia.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/7ognIWQWbGg)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nUsing the Graduated Approach – Kelly Challis\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nDifficulties with reading and spelling not only create many challenges for those who have dyslexia<strong>,</strong> but also for those other young people who are quietly struggling with literacy difficulties in our education system without a diagnosis<strong>. </strong>\n\nWhen using the graduated approach, I need to make sure there is movement around the four stages of action; these stages being assess, plan, do<strong>,</strong> and review. The information I collect helps me to understand the needs of pupils with literacy difficulties and dyslexia<strong>,</strong> and as a result I can put into place strategies to support these learners, working with them to make good progress and ultimately to secure good outcomes in their education.\n\nIn the <strong>‘assess’</strong> stage, I not only use summative and formative assessments, but I also take into consideration the views and experiences of the learner’s parents and carers, as well as the learner’s own view:<strong> what </strong>are they finding difficult, and <strong>why</strong>? It is important at this stage to discuss with the SENCo any standardised scores from educational psychology assessments to make sure I understand their meaning and application to my planning.\n\nIn order to teach according to each child’s educational needs as far as possible, it is essential to see them as a<em> whole</em> person, complete with individual strengths and weaknesses. The information I gather helps me personalise my teaching and address their specific needs.\n\nIn the <strong>‘plan’ </strong>stage of the graduated approach there are 2 areas which need to be considered. First of all, what can I include in my teaching to respond to my pupil with dyslexia’s identified needs? If they have a poor working memory, I must ensure I do not overload this, taking care not to give several instructions at a time. In addition, I need to plan mini-plenaries or Q&amp;As to refresh their memories and gauge their understanding. The SEND Code of Practice is clear that research informs us that the most impact on learner progress comes from the quality of teaching in the classroom.\n\nThe other area to plan for is targeted provision. Intervention forms an important part of assessment. For example, a learner with dyslexia may need a phonics intervention, an input of vocabulary, both everyday and subject specific, or extra reading practice to develop fluency and comprehension. It is important that teachers work closely with teaching assistants or other staff to assess the impact of such targeted interventions and have clear entry and exit criteria.\n\nThe <strong>‘do’</strong> stage of the graduated approach puts my plans into action. The minor adaptations I can make to day-to-day practice and to the learning environment can, in turn, make a huge difference to those learners with literacy difficulties or dyslexia. An added bonus is that all learners will benefit from these changes.\n\nSo what do these changes mean for my learners? It means they can navigate texts with more ease and I can signpost without telling them the answers; it allows the learners to problem solve using my displays rather than raising their hand for me to help them; it means I am confident that the teaching I am delivering is pitched at a level that all learners can engage with.\n\nSome of the adaptations and considerations I have made in my teaching to support my learners with literacy difficulties and dyslexia are:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    I make information on the white board as clear and uncluttered as possible.\n    I also number the start of each line or topic clearly.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    My displays around the classroom are informative and updated regularly.

It comes from the SEND Code of Practice (2014), and it is a reminder that the class teacher is responsible and accountable for the progress and development of all pupils in their class.\n\nHowever, if there is a pupil in your class who requires a greater level of support, feeling knowledgeable and confident enough to know how to support their development can be a worry for new teachers.\n\nOne of the contributing factors which leads to the feeling of being unprepared is the uniqueness of the individual pupil; children with the same diagnosed learning need may require very different support. That said, your knowledge and confidence will develop with experience as you progress through your career. You will add to your mental model of how to teach pupils who require a greater level of support, and your expertise will grow exponentially. While you are still at this early stage, it is essential that you seek support from colleagues and adhere closely to the advice of special education professionals. You are responsible for the progress and development of all your pupils, but this does not mean you are alone.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nThink of a pupil that you have observed or taught that has one of the four areas\nof needs explored last week:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Communication and interaction needs</strong> such as Asperger’s\n    Syndrome\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cognition and learning needs</strong> such as dyslexia\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Social, emotional and mental health difficulties </strong>such as an\n    attachment disorder\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Sensory or physical needs </strong>such as visual impairment\n  </li>\n</ul>\nConsider the following questions and record your response in your notebook:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How prepared do you currently feel to identify strategies that would\n      support this pupil with their learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Who could you seek support from within your setting?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nYou may wish to talk to your mentor more about this at your next mentor interaction.\n$CTA\n\n## Personalising support\n\nAs mentioned in previous sessions, high-quality teaching is positioned as the foundation of all SEND provision. Section 6.37 of the Code of Practice clearly states:\n\n> High-quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN. Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching.\n>\n> (DfE, 2015)\n\nAccess to high-quality teaching is the right of every pupil and building high-quality teaching strategies into your everyday practice should be the first step taken to support all pupils to succeed. Therefore, as an early career teacher, working to develop your understanding and application of effective teaching strategies will help you to meet most of your pupils’ individual needs without creating unnecessary workload.\n\nYou will use the cycle of assess, plan, do and review to support all your pupils. However, this process is likely to become more personalised as pupils’ needs increase, to ensure they receive the targeted and specialist support that they require to achieve meaningful success. It may be that pupils are given additional support through interventions. Where this is the case, it is important to remember that ‘interventions’ (particularly any that require a pupil to leave the classroom) should support the work that is being done in the classroom, and not replace it. As stated in the SEND Code of Practice:\n\n> Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching.\n>\n> (DfE, 2014)\n\n### Seeking support\n\nIt is important to remember that you are not alone in working to overcome pupils’ barriers to learning. The SEND Code of Practice states:\n\n> Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement. This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving, teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered.\n>\n> (DfE, 2014)\n\nSeeking advice and support from your colleagues and, the SENCo, will support your knowledge and understanding of SEN strategies and help your pupils to overcome any barriers to learning.\n\n## Education, Health and Care Plan\n\nPupils who are deemed as needing ‘specialist provision’ would be eligible to access external agencies and services, such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy. Pupils who require specialist support are likely to include pupils with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\n\nSince 2015, pupils with SEND have been classified as either having an EHCP or requiring ‘SEN Support’. EHCPs are awarded by local authorities and set out the additional support a pupil requires for their needs to be met. SEN Support can be provided by the school or external agencies.\n\nAlthough anyone can request that the local authority carry out an assessment on a child, in the school setting EHCPs are most often requested by the SENCo or a parent.\n\nThe number of pupils with an EHCP has increased over the last three years. It is therefore increasingly likely that you may teach a pupil with an EHCP in place, so what is the role of the teacher in the plan?\n\n### Your role in the EHCP\n\nWhether it is in preparation to apply for an EHCP, or whether a pupil has already been granted one, your role as a teacher is to provide information and evidence on the progress and needs of the pupil. The graduated approach will be a key tool in gathering this information and support you to assess the impact of the strategies that have been put in place.\n\nThere is an annual review of EHCP to determine the progress of the pupil, the effectiveness of the strategies, and whether the EHCP is still needed. If you teach a pupil with an EHCP, you will be asked to attend or contribute to the review meeting to provide valuable information about the developing needs of the pupil. Both the pupil and their parents or carers will also be invited to attend this meeting to share their views on how effective the current strategies are and any barriers that are present.\n\n## How can research support you?\n\nThere is a wealth of research around SEN provision that could be used to support you to adapt your teaching practice and develop strategies to overcome barriers to learning. However, you must approach any research with a critical eye. A large amount of research focuses on interventions that worked in one setting yet may not be robust enough to be replicated in yours.\n\nThe strong turn towards evidence-informed practice over the last few years has meant that there is now a robust, peer-reviewed evidence base that helps us understand how children learn best and what this means for education. This broad evidence base highlights that there isn’t currently the same rigour in research around SEN provision. There are, however, significant efforts being made to rectify this.\n\nA useful website to access is the [‘What Works?’](https://www.sendgateway.org.uk/whole-school-send/what-works/) SEND gateway, which is supported by NASEN (National Association for Special Educational Needs). The information and interventions on this site have been peer-reviewed and subjected to a panel process in order to be included. The resources are broken down into each of the four broad areas of need, and then further categorised into universal, targeted and specialist support.\n\nThe Department for Education has commissioned research into what effective practice in school looks like in order to develop understanding of how to improve outcomes for pupils with SEND (Carroll and others, 2017). The report found some good quality evidence on effective interventions to support pupils’ cognition, mental health, communication and interaction needs. It also highlighted how important good assessment is to support teachers to correctly identify individual needs, and the importance of proper training for anyone who is delivering an intervention.\n\nWhen looking at SEN interventions more broadly, there are common themes that emerge that seem to support positive outcomes:\n\n- the effective deployment of a teaching assistant.\n- the importance of engaging all stakeholders, especially parents\n\nIn session 4, you looked at ways to work effectively with your teaching assistant. Let’s look at this in relation to SEN provision, as well as the importance of stakeholder relationships.\n\n## Support from other stakeholders\n\nA stakeholder in education is someone who has an interest in the success and welfare of the school and its pupils. Stakeholders include those who work in the school (e.g. teachers, support staff, governors and specialist services) and those outside (e.g. parents and doctors). The inclusion of stakeholders in the support network around a pupil can play a major part in the successful outcomes experienced by that pupil. The information, advice, and specialist guidance that some stakeholders can provide can change the entire nature of the support and provision given to a pupil.\n\nHowever, it is often forgotten that the pupil themselves is the most important stakeholder. Their voice matters too, and they should be encouraged to share which approaches they feel are working. It is essential to gather the views of the pupil and their family if the graduated approach is to work effectively. It will help to build a more holistic picture of the pupil so that you become more aware of the needs of the individual across different contexts.\n\n$CTA\nHear from Kelly Challis from the Driver Youth Trust, as she explains how engaging with stakeholders can make a huge difference in your ability to support a pupil with SEND and make notes in your notebook.\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/oEzIuComD4s)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nWorking with Stakeholders – Kelly Challis\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The adaptations you make to your everyday class teaching can have a great\n  impact on the progress of the pupil. For example:\n</span>\n<ul>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      ensuring key vocabulary is pre-taught can help ensure that learners are\n      better prepared when they come across it in lessons \n    </span>\n  </li>\n  <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n      Or providing scaffolding for the learner during tasks can mean that they\n      don’t experience the fear of the blank page but have support to start\n      their response \n    </span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  When adaptive teaching does not have the desired impact, suitable\n  interventions should be set up. Interventions need to be effective and\n  evidence based, and progress must be tracked and shared. In some instances,\n  additional assessments may be needed and carried out by the SENCo or\n  potentially other educational professionals. This assessment data needs to be\n  clearly understood and shared with all appropriate stakeholders so that next\n  steps can be planned. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  A stakeholder in education is someone who has an interest in the success and\n  welfare of a school and its pupils. This includes those who work in and\n  outside the school, for example teachers, support staff, parents, governors\n  and specialist services. Each of these people have an important role to play\n  in supporting the pupil to make progress towards their individual goals. These\n  goals may vary greatly, from being able to access elements of the curriculum,\n  to feeling comfortable and safe in the classroom setting. However, it is often\n  forgotten that the young person with SEND is also an important stakeholder and\n  their thoughts and feeling should be listened to and included in any plans.\n  Pupil profiles can be useful in giving a learner the opportunity to make their\n  voice heard. This can help school staff build relationships with them and\n  understand things from their perspective. This information can also inform\n  planning, classroom layout, timetabling and support in order to enable\n  learners to participate in all aspects of classroom learning.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  A graduated approach will help you to monitor the impact of stakeholder\n  support on the development of the pupil. At each step of the way along the\n  assess, plan, do, review cycle, consideration needs to be made as to which\n  stakeholder needs what information, how it will be gathered, and how and when\n  this information must be shared. There needs to be clear processes in place\n  for when to work with specialists, both those within the school and\n  externally. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Most importantly the learner and their family need to be at the centre of the\n  whole process. It is essential to gather their views if the graduated approach\n  is to work effectively. Involving the pupil and their family can help build a\n  more holistic picture of the pupil so that you become more aware of the\n  individual in different contexts. This insight can become invaluable for\n  working out what can work with the pupil.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  High-quality teaching, a graduated approach for SEND, and clear communication\n  channels will ensure schools are on the way to effectively meeting the needs\n  of all their learners. However, if{\" \"}\n</span>\n<b>all</b>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  stakeholders work together and communicate clearly, there will be even a\n  greater impact on young people with SEND, which will support them to achieve\n  better outcomes and realise their true potential.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nBelow are videos that share guidance and advice from key stakeholders.

During my time as a SENDCo I have worked\n  with local GPs and specialised doctors and nurses from a variety of\n  departments such as the child development centre. Regular external agencies I\n  work with include the ear, nose and throat department, audiology team, cleft\n  palate team, school nurses, ophthalmologists, autism assessment team, the\n  visual impairment and hearing impairment team and speech and language\n  therapists and language development workers.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It is imperative to engage with these services to ensure the pupils are able\n  to access the correct provision and learning environments to enable them to\n  succeed. For example, we have several pupils in the school who are hearing\n  impaired. The hearing impairment team regularly visit the school to advise on\n  top tips for those pupils in different lessons, from the lighting, seating\n  position and correct use of radio aids. We are able to use the knowledge we\n  have gained to help other pupils as soon as they begin to attend our school,\n  to ensure the pupil is able to engage in all lessons as soon as they walk\n  through the door.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Communication is key when working with other stakeholders. There may be times\n  when you need to do a bit of detective work and knowing who to contact and\n  having good relationships means a faster result for the child.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Including parents/carers, and the pupil themselves, in the process is key to\n  being able to contact the right people. By having all the information from all\n  the individuals involved in the pupil's life, you will be able to get a fully\n  rounded picture of any support that needs to be in place, which will\n  ultimately mean the pupil is able to progress in their education.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  It is important to be aware that some parents/carers will have very little\n  experience with the SEND process and external agencies. Likewise, they may\n  have a wealth of knowledge that can be shared with and learned from. Regular\n  meetings should be held with parents/carers to ensure knowledge and\n  information can be gathered, as well as working together to ensure the child’s\n  voice is included. An open-door policy will also help parents/carers in\n  feeling empowered to approach staff with any information rather than waiting\n  for time-specified meetings.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n**2. Parent Liane Bunn talks about the challenges her family faced when transitioning her son from nursery to primary school.**\n\n$Accordion\n$EndAccordion\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIb6Nxv_Cw&feature=youtu.be)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nParent view – Liane Bunn\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Bill is 4 1/2 years old and has been deaf in the left ear from birth. He also\n  has intermittent hearing loss in the right ear. Alongside this, he also been\n  diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder which, for Bill, can present in\n  different ways. When overstimulated by the environment, or overtired and\n  ‘triggered’, he can have shutdowns that sometimes look like seizures or\n  periods of absences. He can become unresponsive, limp, slack-mouthed, or\n  demonstrates repetitive behaviours he is unaware of (like an arm or leg moving\n  up and down). \n</span>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  As it is quite unpredictable how he will react to different stimuli it can be\n  difficult to understand Bill's needs, as they can differ from moment to\n  moment.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The nursery Bill attends is well set up for children with hearing loss and\n  sensory impairment – it is one of the reasons we selected it. This means that\n  there are many strategies staff use through the day (such as signing or giving\n  visual cues) that benefit all of the children, even if they haven't been\n  identified as needing it. Because these strategies are in place, Bill is\n  comfortable at nursery and tends to not have the bigger episodes of shutdown\n  while he is there. This has resulted in the nursery saying that they were\n  happy that Bill would be able to slot right into his new school and not need\n  extra support or adaptation made. As his parents, we felt this was optimistic\n  to say the least, so I contacted the school where he will begin in September. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Bill's older brother attends this school already and so I was able to explain\n  a little of our situation. They were instantly very reassuring. They offered a\n  meeting before the school applications had even closed, so that they could\n  understand more about Bill and what his needs  might be. They explained that\n  if Bill transitioned well, with no extra support, then that is wonderful.\n  However, if we collectively felt that he may need some support, they would\n  much rather be proactive and have plans in place. They asked about what\n  strategies the nursery uses that we feel helps Bill, and also what we do at\n  home. We were able to share several strategies such as supporting his hearing\n  loss by using Makaton. Bill is very familiar with the signs, and in a noisy\n  classroom Makaton really can help him to understand and process what is being\n  asked. He often misses the beginning and ends of words, so using Makaton means\n  he understands much better what is going on. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Bill is a completely different child when he recognises where he is, who he is\n  with, and what is going to happen. When things happen he isn't expecting, it\n  can really be a struggle. He can also struggle to pick up new skills until he\n  has been shown them several times. He needs to be allowed to watch until he\n  feels comfortable to join in. Therefore, strategies like visual timetables,\n  cue cards for routines, and countdown timers to signal change overs, really\n  help him prepare and process what he is being asked to do. The cue cards are\n  especially good for supporting his memory of how to do something, or the\n  sequence it needs to be done in. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Another strategy that was particularly effective was that the nursery assigns\n  each day of the week a colour, feel, and smell to help the children to learn\n  and process each of these gradually. It is a gentle introduction to new senses\n  that has become part of the routine of his day. The next time he encounters\n  them he won’t be so surprised by them, and this could avoid any sensory\n  overload happening. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The school have said they will ask the nursery for the details of each of\n  these and will be able to implement at least some of them very easily, without\n  disruption or additional cost. They explained that some of these things\n  already help a number of children in the school and they gave us the further\n  suggestions of using weighted toys and knee pads for circle time. The\n  understanding of these needs and the implication of these strategies will, I\n  am positive, prove to be a great help to Bill. It felt wonderful that they had\n  taken the time to listen to our concerns, and engage with us in discussing\n  strategies that would support my son. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  As his parents we couldn't feel happier about the approach the school have\n  used. We feel completely relaxed about this transition and very much like any\n  ideas or thoughts will be listened to. The difference between this and the\n  feelings we have been left with from nursery at times is unquantifiable. The\n  transition to school can be a scary enough time, but when your child has\n  additional needs that aren't always obvious, and you think your worries,\n  concerns and knowledge of your child are being ignored, it is even harder.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n**3.

Graduated approach, pupil voice\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  I taught a pupil who was diagnosed with dyslexia and obsessive-compulsive\n  disorder with elements of autism. Here, I needed to put the pupil and their\n  needs at the centre of the graduated approach. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This included engaging with them in open conversations about which strategies\n  worked well for them and which ones did not and discussing how they like to be\n  approached in the lesson. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Once I had this information, I cross-referenced it with other information that\n  I had on the pupil, for example any information from multi-agency meetings,\n  the SENCo, and previous information gathered from their parents. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Once I had done this, I approached and spoke to their parents myself to look\n  into what had and what had not previously worked for their child. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Then I set about using a low-stakes testing method to find out where they were\n  in relation to their peers – this is something I often use with my whole class\n  as part of high-quality teaching. This represented the assess phase of the\n  graduated approach. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  From here I could plan how to best support them over the following academic\n  year by providing extra support to address key misconceptions or topics that\n  were particularly difficult for the child. For example, as the pupil had\n  difficulty understanding perceptual reasoning, when teaching shapes, angles\n  and area, I knew they would require more concrete examples. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  When reviewing the strategies, I spoke with the pupil regularly to see if my\n  lessons were having an impact. I also looked at carefully selected data to\n  measure if there was progress. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Including the pupil’s voice in this process meant that the pupil felt they\n  could have an open conversation with me when things were not working for them.\n  This helped to make the pupil feel safe and supported, which in turn led to\n  emboldened confidence – the key ingredient to getting any pupil with\n  additional needs to give your lesson a go.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nA common theme running through all the videos is that of ‘clear communication’.

He joined our school in Nursery, just after his second birthday, and  he entered my Reception classroom with an Educational Health Care Plan to support him. To ensure I effectively supported him with his learning when he transitioned from nursery to reception, I used the graduated approach.\n\n<h4>Assess</h4>\nDuring the assess phase, I started by trying to gain an understanding of the pupil\nas an individual to understand what their learning needs might be. To do this I made\nuse of any available data – I spoke to the previous class teacher about how they\nhad supported him in Nursery, whether there had been any interventions, timetable\nchanges or any other resources used to support him. I looked through his EHCP to\nidentify what his targets were and spoke to the SENCo for further guidance on how\nI could support him to achieve these targets through adaptive teaching.\n<h4>Plan</h4>\nFrom the assess phase, it became apparent that the pupil was struggling with different\nsensory experiences and became discomforted when touching different textures. Therefore,\nduring the planning stage, I focused on planning for strategies that would support\nand develop his ability to cope with different sensory experiences. After speaking\nwith the SENDCo, I planned to provide the pupil with 3 different activities each\nweek to support his sensory targets. The activities I planned for him to do were\ntouching rainbow slime, painting using his fingers and playing with farm animals\nthat were in a tray of foam.\n<h4>Do</h4>\nTo implement these activities in the classroom, I put the activities in what we call\nhis ‘challenge boxes’. This is a tray in the classroom that is set up just for him.\nIn the tray, there was one activity for him to access at a time. These activities\nwere sometimes carried out with me, and sometimes with his 1:1 learning support assistant,\nalthough, he was encouraged to access and complete these activities independently.\nOnce he had completed one activity, it was replaced with a different one. He was\nencouraged to complete the three activities several times over the course of the\nweek.\n<h4>Review</h4>\nDuring the review phase, I met with other stakeholders to discuss the progress the\npupil had made in our school. We do the ‘review’ element at the end of each half-term\nto see how the pupil has developed, which helps to inform their next steps. The pupil\nhad met his target, so we used any new data we had to begin the cycle again and set\nnew ones.\n\nThese targets were focused on progressing his sensory needs further. For example, one of his new targets was freezing dinosaur eggs, which I had planned to implement myself. These were in his challenge boxes for him to access and I encouraged him to access these throughout the morning session.\n\nThe process of assess, plan, do, review, is continually used to shape the support around the changing needs of the pupil as they progress throughout the year and their school journey. It has helped him to make good progress towards his targets and his confidence to touch new objects in the classroom and at home has grown. He says he feels happy in school and this is reflected in his behaviour.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n### Cognition and learning needs\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/eJPlqUYsGDU)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nBarriers to reading case study – Primary\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI'll begin with filling in the background of the pupil. The pupil was in year 3 and their barrier to learning was reading. They had not passed the phonics screening check in year 1 but had passed in year 2. Their attainment was below age-related expectations but not significant enough for a SEND diagnosis. So although this pupil was making some progress, it was reading that continued to be the challenge. I used the graduated approach to identify the pupil's needs, generate strategies to support them, and evaluate these strategies based on the pupil’s progress.\n\nDuring the 'assess' phase I gathered as much information as possible. Through the RAG meeting we  identified that the child had a 2.3 score for reading. The RAG meeting is a meeting held between the principal, senior leaders and the class teacher. The frequency of meetings varies, and can be somewhere between every week or every six weeks, depending on the age and need of the children. During the meeting, children are given a rating of green, amber or red. This enables the team to discuss those children who are securing age-related expectations (green), those children who are working significantly below age-related expectations and are likely to be SEND (red), and those children who are in danger of falling behind (amber). The amber group has three gradings: 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. The grade enables the team to identify appropriate levels of need. For example, a score of 2.1 would require some elements of high-quality teaching to be adapted; 2.2 would require some intervention outside the lesson; and 2.3 would require significant support such as one-to-one. The process is focused on outcomes and the child is at the centre. We also met with parents to discuss further support, such as reading support at home, targeted homework, and to clearly communicate the strategies that were being employed in school.\n\nAn in-depth analysis was carried out by the English lead to support me with next steps in the pupil's learning. The analysis identified that whilst decoding was not an issue, the pupil was not reading for meaning, that although they could confidently segment and blend, they were not making meaning from words and sentences.\n\nDuring the 'plan' phase, I used the information obtained from assessments and parents to decide what actions to take place. It was identified that the pupil would need support and interventions to develop their comprehension skills.\n\nSo, the 'do' phase. To support the pupil to meet their desired outcomes, specific actions were implemented. These were:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    First of all, providing focused support in lessons, such as being part of a\n    focus group during lessons more regularly. This involved the child sitting\n    at a horsehoe table with a group of other children during the main lesson.\n    This means I can provide more one-to-one support, to hear that child read\n    and check for meaning during teaching.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    They read to an adult every day with a focus on understanding vocabulary to\n    develop comprehension.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    And also, there were lesson visits from an SLT member to engage the pupil in\n    discussions and promote a love of reading and book choices.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The child also received a reading intervention that focused on reading\n    prosody, which refers to the expressiveness with which a pupil reads; it\n    focuses on the intontation and rhythm and emphasis given to words and\n    sentences when reading out loud.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nDuring the 'review' phase, we identified that the impact of this support on the pupil\nwas positive. The pupil had become more confident at reading, the parents more engaged\nin the child’s learning, and the gap between the child’s ability and age-related\nreading expectations had narrowed.\n\nThe cycle of the graduated approach continues, and the pupil is tracked through the RAG assessment, and their needs are met though carefully tailored high-quality teaching and interventions, and there is ongoing monitoring from SLT lesson visits, pupil voice and tracking. The regular review of their progress is allowing us to shift the support to meet their changing needs.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - Graduated Approach, Cognition and Learning\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nPeter is in year 9. He does not have a specific diagnosis. However, he has a significant delay in his cognitive (thinking skills/thought processes) ability and this translates as a major barrier to his learning on a daily basis. Peter learns at a significantly slower pace than his peers, despite robust quality-first teaching. As such, he requires interventions, above and beyond that which is provided to his peers.\n\nThe barriers Peter faces with his cognition and learning difficulties encompass the entire curriculum, including literacy and numeracy delay, difficulties with his working memory, and his processing ability is impaired. Specifically, Peter struggles with the speed in which he can process information, difficulties with manipulating information using his working memory and global barriers relating to his literacy delays. It means in real terms accessing any part of the curriculum can be difficult for Peter.\n\nSecondary to this, Peter often demonstrates associated issues with lacking engagement, attention and concentration and his frustrations with his difficulties often manifest themselves in behavioural concerns.\n\nPeter continues to face challenges in his learning, despite receiving high-quality teaching; as a result he requires additional strategies, or different provision, in order to meet his needs.\n\n<strong>Assess</strong> – using the graduated approach, judgements need to be made\nusing all of the data we hold on that particular pupil. For Peter the data pointed\nto there being significant difficulties faced by Peter whenever language was the\nbarrier to his learning. That means the language barrier needs to be addressed even\nin subjects like maths, where the barrier needs to be removed to allow him to ‘see’\nthe maths.\n\nJudgements about the progress Peter makes alert you to any barriers that may be getting in the way of them making comparable progress to their peers. At this stage Peter was referred, via the SENDCo, to the educational psychologist for further investigation as the gap between the progress he was making continued to widen, despite receiving interventions such as the Accelerated Reading programme and having some literacy-focused in-class support from a teaching assistant.\n\n<strong>Plan</strong> - This part of the cycle involves discussing, planning and\nagreeing what will be put in place as an outcome of the assessment information gathered.\nThe planning should involve the pupil, parents and staff from the school who know\nthe pupil well. Where other professionals are working with the child, they should\nalso contribute to planning. The initial step of the planning process includes agreeing\ntargets for the pupil in order to focus attention on key areas and give them a clear\nidea of what they need to do to improve their work. Personalised support was planned\nfor Peter to address his identified outcomes; specific teaching strategies were communicated\nto his teachers via his Learning Plan outlining the approaches and resources that\nmust be used in his lessons to meet his needs. At this stage these included:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Teaching material in small chunks and providing memory joggers and visual\n    checklists\n  </li>\n  <li>Providing additional scaffolding/word banks for extended writing</li>\n  <li>Pre-teaching of new vocabulary</li>\n  <li>Using a laptop for extended writing tasks</li>\n  <li>Using a multi-sensory approach to literacy</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Do</strong> - The Code of Practice makes it clear that it is the\nresponsibility of class and subject teachers to implement the plan on a\nday-to-day basis.\n\n<strong>Review</strong> - A timescale for reviewing the plan, and details of how\nprogress will be monitored, also needs to be identified. When the review meeting\nbetween the pupil, parents and any relevant professionals takes place, it is helpful\nto consider the following questions:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    What progress has the pupil made? Have they achieved their agreed targets\n    and what is the evidence for this?\n  </li>\n  <li>What impact has the support/intervention had on progress?</li>\n  <li>\n    What are the pupil’s, parents’ and professionals’ views on the\n    support/intervention?\n  </li>\n  <li>What changes need to be made to targets or provision next term?</li>\n</ul>\nThe assess, plan, do, review process is a cycle – the idea being that this process\nis continual. If the review shows a pupil has made really good progress, this may\nmean they no longer require the additional provision made through SEN support. If\nthis is the case, the pupil is likely to be taken off the SEN record and, instead,\nwill be monitored to ensure progress is sustained through inclusive high-quality\nteaching. This is a continual process unless the pupil narrows the progress gap between\nthem and their peers sufficiently. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n### Communication and interaction\n\n**Speech and language case study - Early Years**\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgboW4KQqLM&feature=youtu.be)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nSpeech and language case study - Early Years\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nThis case study describes how we have used the graduated approach to support a pupil – referred to as Pupil A throughout this video – with communication and interaction needs. The system follows the four stages, often referred to as a 'cycle': Assess, Plan, Do, Review. (For further information about this cycle, often referred to as the 'graduated approach', see Chapter 6 of the SEND Code of Practice 2015.)\n\nPupil A is a 4 year old, Asian, summer-born boy, who started his Reception year after having a limited time spent in an education setting, from our feeder Nursery School. The pupil is also a second language learner, speaking Hindko at home. Pupil A does not have any diagnosis of specific language impairment (SLI) at this stage. His non-verbal skills are a relative strength. He displays signs of phonological disorder with features of verbal dyspraxia, which means he makes pronunciation errors, but again no diagnosis as his attendance was poor at nursery. Pupil A also has a hearing impairment and is involved with the hearing specialist teacher who supports with radio aids. He does not wear his hearing aids at home, which is impacting on his hearing loss. These concerns are severely impacting on his ability to make himself understood. He doesn’t have an EHCP at present, but concerns were raised by the SENDCo at the previous setting.\n\n<h4>Assess</h4>\nAs the class teacher, I worked closely with the SENDCo to discuss Pupil A’s needs\nand created a baseline assessment by which progress will be measured. One of the\nsignificant issues we faced was parental engagement with learning at home, which\nbecame clear through, for example, non-engagement with home learning tasks, reading\nat home and attendance at meetings. A review of hearing aid use at home was also\ncompleted by the hearing impairment specialist which revealed the lack of use of\nhearing aids at home. This revealed that Pupil A, therefore, had a severely limited\nexposure to language, which was impacting on the amount of progress he was making.\nA sharing meeting was held between myself, parents, SENDCo and the hearing impairment\nspecialist to discuss all of the issues outlined above. In this meeting, we also\nfound that his parents felt Pupil A could speak in complex sentences in his home\nlanguage so our commissioned Speech and Language therapist arranged for a language\nassessment in his home language.\n<h4>Plan</h4>\nThe speech and language assessment provided a thorough assessment in Pupil A’s home\nlanguage and showed that he was significantly below in his home and second language.\nParents needed support in accepting that he had additional needs, even though mum\nhad started comparing him to her 2-year-old. A plan of additional support was drawn\nup for him where both staff and parents agreed what outcomes they hoped would be\nmade, and by what date. For example, one outcome was for him to be able to recall\na number of nouns for common objects, e.g. television, banana, etc. by the next review\ndate. A record of this plan was kept in the school and one was sent home.\n<h4>Do</h4>\nPupil A was given extra support. Some of the interventions that were put in place\nwere adaptations to my classroom practice whilst others were interventions carried\nout by specialists. We also involved his parents in this stage of the process. Some\nexamples of the adaptations to practice made were:\n<ul>\n  <li>Using a visual timetable to support with routines.</li>\n  <li>\n    Pre-teaching of topics before it was introduced to the rest of the class.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Allocating a quiet space with the support of the hearing impairment\n    specialist.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Providing daily Time to Talk interventions with a small group of children.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The commissioned Speech and Language therapist focussed on Blank Level 1-2\n    questioning and quieter speech sounds such as ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘th’ and ‘r.’\n  </li>\n  <li>Asking parents to practise basic words with him.</li>\n  <li>\n    Asking his parents to ensure he wears his hearing aid at home and making\n    them aware that this would be monitored.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Each half-term, the hearing impairment specialist scheduled home visits to\n    check the frequency of the use of hearing aids at home\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Review</h4>I as class teacher attended half-termly meetings with the team\naround the child including the SENDCo, Hearing Impairment Specialist, Speech and\nLanguage Therapist and parents. Here we reviewed his targets and quickly\nidentified that Pupil A was struggling to make progress. In particular, he found\nit challenging to retain information. As an outcome of the meeting, it was\nagreed that the SENDCo, with the support of the class teacher writing a\ndescription of the needs of Pupil A, would engage the community paediatrician in\norder to enable us to explore any further underlying issues.\n<h3>\n  <strong>The graduated approach – the second cycle</strong>\n</h3>\nDuring the review stage of the first cycle, it was found that Pupil A was not\nmeeting his outcomes, so a second cycle began which included a more detailed\nassessment which led to an even more personalised plan to support Pupil A.\n<h4>Assess</h4>\nThrough the involvement of the paediatrician, the Early Support Monitoring\nProtocol for Deaf Babies and Children (ESMP) was used to assess his development.\nThis indicated that Pupil A, who was 4 years and 9 months old at the time,\nexperienced a significant cognitive delay and was at a level of development of a\nchild between 15 and 18 months of age.\n<h4>Plan</h4>\nDuring the second plan phase, it was recommended that Pupil A was offset and so\nthat he could repeat his Reception year. The reasons why this was necessary were\nclearly explained to his parents and they supported this decision too. New\noutcomes were decided upon and the cycle continued.\n<h4>Do</h4>\nUsing the graduated approach helped to identify Pupil A’s significant needs.\nThe <strong>Assess, Plan, Do, Review</strong> cycle needs to be fluid and\nflexible to ensure both the teacher and school can respond to the pupil's needs.\nBy keeping him back a year, we were able to help him meet new outcomes. Several\nof the interventions included in the initial ‘Do’ phase continued into the\nsecond cycle.\n<h4>Review</h4>\nAlthough Pupil A’s attainment remained behind his peers, his progress became\nmuch more rapid and sustained over time. The <strong>\n  Assess, Plan, Do, Review\n</strong> cycle is continually used as Pupil A moves through school to ensure\nthe provision in place supports his evolving needs as identified on his EHCP,\nwhich was gained during Pupil A’s offset year in Reception. $EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n**Speech and language case study - Secondary**\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nScript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nSpeech and language case study – Secondary\n\nBy Helen Bownes\n\nMikey is a year 11 pupil. He has historically had significant delays in his speech and language acquisition. He attended an additionally resourced primary provision for speech, language and communication difficulties. He was deemed appropriate, however, for attendance at a mainstream school with enhanced provision. He is currently a year behind his chronological age due to the fact that his progress was hindered by his complex difficulties. He no longer requires speech and language therapy. His speech however can still be difficult to understand for the unfamiliar listener.\n\nIn terms of barriers, Mikey’s difficulties with all aspects of language have resulted in him having difficulties with his cognition and learning that relates to literacy. He also finds it difficult to maintain his attention and concentration for sustained periods of time, especially when a task is challenging. There are also some elements of social communication and interaction that Mikey finds problematic on a daily basis.\n\nMikey continues to face challenges in his learning, despite receiving high-quality teaching; as a result he requires additional strategies, or different provision, in order to meet his needs. Mikey is very resilient and determined, he embraces all interventions put in place and support offered to him. His family are valued stakeholders in the entire process. They are realistic, supportive and provide endless encouragement from home. There are now currently no other external agencies involved in the provision for Mikey, although this may change as he transitions into his post-16 pathway.\n\n<strong>Assess</strong> – using the graduated approach judgements need to be made\nusing all of the data we hold on that particular pupil. For Mikey the data pointed\nto there being significant difficulties faced by him whenever language was the barrier\nto his learning. That means the language barrier needs to be addressed even in subjects\nlike maths, where the barrier needs to be removed to allow him to ‘see’ the maths.\nBy doing this it enables Mikey to experience success in areas that he is more accomplished\nat, once his primary barrier is removed. Mikey also felt when he chose his key stage\n4 pathway that he wanted to complete more vocational courses and steer away from\nmodern foreign languages, as he felt he would struggle to overcome the barrier of\nthe speaking component.\n\nJudgements about the progress Mikey makes alert you to any barriers that may be getting in the way of him making comparable progress to his peers. As Mikey started key stage 4, there was a shift to where the support was placed. There was an emphasis on teaching assistants in the core subjects, and the deployment of staff was shifted. Mikey had previously been reliant on a ‘velcro’ style of support; the need was to focus on him utilising more of a model of support that allowed him to develop the skills to become more independent and to support him in getting himself out of the learning pit where he previously might have been reliant on an adult. The heavy use of collaborative learning combined nicely with this shift in support. There was an overwhelming improvement in Mike’s ability to discuss topics and be involved in working with others as a result.\n\n<strong>Plan</strong> – This part of the cycle involves discussing, planning and\nagreeing what will be put in place as an outcome of the assessment information gathered.\nThe planning should involve the pupil, parents and staff from the school who know\nthe pupil well. Where other professionals are working with the child, they should\nalso contribute to planning. The initial step of the planning process includes agreeing\ntargets for the pupil in order to focus attention on key areas and give them a clear\nidea of what they need to do to improve their work. In Mikey’s case there was an\nabundance of previous strategies and interventions which continue to support him\nfully in accessing mainstream educational provision.\n\nFollowing this, personalised support was implemented for Mikey to address his identified outcomes, and specific teaching strategies were communicated to his teachers via his Learning Plan outlining the approaches and resources that must be used in his lessons to meet his needs. At this stage these included:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Pre-teaching of new vocabulary</li>\n  <li>Using of a laptop for extended writing tasks</li>\n  <li>Using social stories to support social interaction</li>\n  <li>Carefully planning when to work collaboratively</li>\n  <li>\n    Developing strategies to support independence and self-help when struggling\n    with tasks\n  </li>\n  <li>Providing scaffolding and/or word banks for extended writing</li>\n  <li>Providing visual cues and memory</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Do</strong> – The Code of Practice makes it clear that it is the\nresponsibility of class and subject teachers to implement the plan on a\nday-to-day basis.\n\n<strong>Review</strong> – A timescale for reviewing the plan, and details of how\nprogress will be monitored, also need to be identified. When the review meeting between\nthe pupil, parents and any relevant professionals takes place, it is helpful to consider\nthe following questions:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    What progress has the pupil made? Have they achieved their agreed targets\n    and what is the evidence for this?\n  </li>\n  <li>What impact has the support/intervention had on progress?</li>\n  <li>\n    What are the pupil’s, parents’ and professionals’ views on the\n    support/intervention?\n  </li>\n  <li>What changes need to be made to targets or provision next term?</li>\n</ul>\nThe assess, plan, do, review process is a cycle – the idea being that this process\nis continual. If the review shows a pupil has made really good progress, this may\nmean they no longer require the additional provision made through SEN support. If\nthis is the case, the pupil is likely to be taken off the SEN record and, instead,\nwill be monitored to ensure progress is sustained through inclusive high-quality\nteaching. This is a continual process unless the pupil narrows the progress gap between\nthem and their peers sufficiently. $EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n### **Social, emotional and mental health**\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/DOm-7enD_Nc)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nAttachment and hypervigilence case study\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nI taught a pupil who was diagnosed with an attachment disorder and hypervigilance. Along with some learning difficulties, this pupil also presented with some very challenging behaviour. They lacked confidence in themselves and would often be in low mood. If they felt anxious they could be quite hyperactive in class, and did find it difficult to concentrate for long periods of time.\n\nThe level of support around this pupil were highly personalised and the graduated approach was something I used to monitor progress carefully and support us in our judgements as to whether they were having any impact or not.\n\n<h4>Assess</h4>\nBefore this pupil entered my class, to support with assessments, they actually visited\nmy classroom several times with their current teacher. They took part in some of\nmy lessons, got to know where things were in the room, and I took this opportunity\nto chat with them and find out more about them. I found out that they loved Maths,\nfootball, and wrote rap songs. I knew that this pupil had a great relationship with\ntheir current teacher, so their teacher and I spoke a lot about how they had developed\nthis and general strategies that were working well. The pupil had been working with\nthe CAMHS team, including an educational psychologist, so I made sure I read the\nreports from them and knew what recommendations had been given for supporting with\ntheir learning and behaviour. I had taught this child’s sibling the previous year,\nso I did already have a relationship with the family. If I didn’t have this relationship\nin place, I would have spoken to them very early in the year about what they have\nfound effective and established some norms about how were going to communicate. Attachment\ndisorder or hypervigilance weren’t things I knew too much about at the time, so I\nalso did a lot of reading and finding  strategies on my own, as well as talking to\nthe SENCo about what was working well in school.\n<h4>Plan</h4>\nThe first question we would ask ourselves as we planned out a strategy or intervention\nwas always ‘will this pupil feel safe in this situation?’ This didn’t mean that I\nas a teacher was putting them in a dangerous situation, more that if the pupil perceived\nsomething to be out of the normal routine without prior warning, they would have\na heightened sense of awareness that would make them feel very anxious. Other situations\nthat would lead to them feel anxious were if the corridor was too busy, if there\nwas a supply teacher needed, if we did maths before breaktime – anything that was\nunexpected could lead to heightened anxiety levels. If this happened, they wouldn't\nbe calm enough to participate fully in their learning, and there was also a risk\nthat these feelings of fear and uncertainty would manifest into challenging behaviours.\nSo to counteract this we planned strategies that would allow them to be as prepared\nas possible about what was happening. Strategies in the plan were things like visual\ntimetables, me giving clear explanations, writing instructions down for them, support\nwith transitioning between the classroom and the playground from a TA, class countdown\ntimers to support focus, and reward charts to praise good behaviour.\n<h4>Do</h4>\nAlong with the strategies that I planned, I stuck to my routines for the day very\ntightly, I would share what was happening in the day using a visual timetable and\nif anything was going to deviate from this I would speak to this pupil to prepare\nthem so that it didn’t leave them feeling uncertain. I also had to be very consistent\nwith my expectations around behaviour and I had to follow through on any consequences.\nMe being very consistent meant that I was predictable in my behaviour and this pupil\nfelt a level of comfort and trust around that. Having clear behavioural boundaries\nmeant that if they were ever crossed, they knew what consequences to expect, so this\nstopped the pupil from entering a ‘fight or flight’ mode and any challenging behaviour\nescalating. Genuine and specific praise was also something that was very important\nfor supporting with their self-image – which is something we worked hard to improve.\nThey liked to know specifically what they had done that was good, and they thrived\non being able to show other teachers good work or me calling home with positive news.\nWe also set up a routine whereby once a week the pupil would support children in\nthe younger year groups in Maths. This was to try and encourage self-confidence,\nbut also to promote and reward calm and patient behaviour – which they needed to\nexhibit when working with the younger pupils.\n<h4>Review</h4>\nThe strategies we put in place to support the pupil’s self-image and behaviour were\ngenerally effective. If they ever weren’t, it was quick to identify, as their behaviour\nwould change. It meant that I was very responsive as a teacher. The work the pupil\ndid with the younger children in Maths was particularly effective at improving their\nself-image, and they took a great deal of pride in preparing the resources to take\nwith them to classroom.\n\nWe had termly reviews with the Ed psych, and we would discuss progress towards the emotional and behavioural goals that we had set for the pupil. Although their parents were at times difficult to engage, I would call home or grab them at the end of the day to give positive news. With the support of the Ed pysch, we also adapted the reward chart so that it could also be utilised at home.\n\nI taught this pupil for two years and I learnt a lot about them and also my own practice. My biggest take-away was around the importance of getting to know the pupil and understanding their needs and what lies behind their behaviour. If a child has a social, emotional and mental health need, it is also important to recognise that that child may need their self-confidence and self-image boosted in order to support their academic progress and achievement.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\nAt the end of the last session you began to reflect on how your actions to support a pupil aligned with the assess, plan, do, review cycle.

This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.\n\n5.7 Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.\n\n_5a.

As we move to think about curriculum at a school and classroom level, a curriculum provides coherence (how the content, assessment, pedagogy and teaching materials align and reinforce each other). This is important because when curriculum lacks coherence, it is both harder to teach and harder for children to locate and place their new knowledge (Myatt, 2018). Only a well-designed curriculum enables successful learning.\n\nIn order to understand your role in curriculum design, let us look at the differences between the National Curriculum and the curriculum at a school and classroom level more closely. The National Curriculum provides programmes of study and attainment targets for each national curriculum subject, setting out the knowledge and skills to be taught at each key stage. A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the National Curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning. At the classroom level, the curriculum will also include pedagogy (how the curriculum will be taught) and how pupils will be assessed.\n\n$I\nA roadmap is a helpful metaphor when thinking about designing a curriculum: a roadmap shows the destination (the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the content to be taught) and the route to get there (the teaching practices most likely to lead to successful learning). When good schemes of work are in place, they can therefore reduce teacher workload and give teachers autonomy to adjust the ‘route’ as the scheme unfolds, lesson by lesson (Myatt 2018).\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Listen to Ed Vainker, Executive Head at Reach Academy Feltham, talk about what\n  he thinks the purpose of curriculum is for pupils, teachers and schools.\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/Er05UFZgSFA)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nWhat is the purpose of a curriculum? – Ed Vainker\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<strong>What is the purpose of a curriculum for schools?</strong>\n\nSo for schools I think a curriculum allows them to sequence and organize the knowledge that they want pupils to develop, and the skills they want people to develop over their time in the school, so it would include clarifying the order in which that should happen and also the content itself, so what it is they want pupils to learn and what skills they want pupils to develop and to what level.\n\n<strong>What is the purpose of a curriculum for teachers?</strong>\n\nFor teachers a curriculum allows them to be clear about the knowledge and the ordering and the sequencing with which they want pupils to acquire that knowledge and the way that they're going to demonstrate the particular skills of that subject, and it helps them to prioritise because within a subject there's so much that can be taught, but to prioritise what each pupil needs and to make sure that they're building on what pupils have learned in the past.\n\n<strong>What is the purpose of a curriculum for students?</strong>\n\nAs someone who's kind of studied the subject at university or at A level we, you've, developed a picture, a kind of a schema, a way of organizing your knowledge of that subject and so when you learn something new, you learn it in the context of other things that you've previously learned. And that's what we're trying to help pupils to do while they're at school, to build these schema, these pictures of a subject in their heads, and a curriculum is what helps children to develop that schema and helps them to organise their learning and so that they can see how the way the Shang dynasty fell is connected to the fall of the Roman empire and that when an empire gets particularly big it becomes harder to keep it kind of under control. And that ability to organize knowledge and to organize ideas is what pupils I think can get from a well-planned curriculum.\n\n<strong>What are the main features of a high-quality curriculum?</strong>\n\nSo a high-quality curriculum has been carefully thought about and it's been carefully designed to be rigorous so it's challenging and it asks pupils to develop really complex and challenging ideas, and then importantly it's been really carefully sequenced and so the ordering of how pupils will learn and what they will learn at different times has been thought about and there are connections made across time and space, so that a year three curriculum builds on what pupils will have learnt in year two and ensures that that is growing their schema and their picture of the subject.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n## Choosing the topic of your scheme of work\n\nBefore we go any further, the first thing you need to do is to decide what your scheme of work will be about.\n\nIt makes sense for you to select a topic you will be teaching this or next academic year, so that you can teach it. This will also give you the added benefit of being able to review and revise your scheme based on how it goes.\n\nGiven we’re already in the Summer term, this might mean thinking ahead to the pupils and topics you will be teaching next year. If you’re not sure about what topic to pick, talk to your mentor before moving onto the next session.\n\n## Capitalise on existing resources\n\nWhen designing your scheme of work, don’t feel that you need to start everything from scratch. You will not be the first teacher (nor the last!) to go through this thinking and planning process, so make the most of building on what others have done before you.\n\nDraw on the expertise of your colleagues and wider professional networks and seek out many of the high-quality resources that exist online. Not only will this reduce your workload, it will also enable you to connect with and learn from your colleagues and the wider teaching profession.\n\nColleagues in your department or phase – and in your wider professional networks – are likely to have a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and practice activities that they can share with you.\n\nHowever, keep in mind is that your decisions about what resources to use should be driven by the needs of the curriculum (i.e. the concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils need to learn). What can be tempting, but should be avoided, is using a resource that you think looks great and distorting your scheme to fit it in. Using resources aligned with the school curriculum (e.g. textbooks or shared resources designed by experienced colleagues) will help you to develop a scheme of work that is coherent and well sequenced.\n\nAs you’re no doubt already aware, there is also an abundance of teaching and learning resources available online. This can feel overwhelming, especially as not all these resources are of a high quality. Following the recommendations of experienced colleagues is a good place to start.\n\n$CTA\nBelow are some questions which you could ask yourself when looking through available resources:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Does the resource align with the school curriculum?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Does the resource focus on the essential concepts and/or knowledge and/or\n      principles of the subject?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      If the resource or material is related to a pupil activity, does it ensure\n      pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject you want\n      pupils to learn?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Activity\n\nWatch the video of either Emily (Primary and Secondary) or Maria (Early Years) as they share how they sought out the expertise of colleagues and existing resources when designing their scheme of work.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/-_BkcdqHEUE)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nSeeking the expertise of colleagues and existing resources – Emily Maule\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWhen planning a scheme of work, it is important to do as much research as possible, making use of materials from subject specialists with more experience in the topic, so that we can be sure we are delivering material of the highest calibre to our pupils. Even though I studied geography at university and studied volcanology specifically in my final year, there were still elements that I researched again to make sure I was really teaching accurate information and providing the most helpful maps, diagrams and graphs. For example, for a long time teachers in Secondary school have taught that convection currents in the mantle move the tectonic plates. But we now know that this is not entirely true and that actually gravity and the weight of the plates are fundamental to their movement. I wanted to make sure this information, which is taught in the A Level curriculum, was present in the year 7 unit, because it makes it easier for pupils to understand, and also because I want my pupils to have geographically accurate knowledge.\n\nAnd despite having taught plate tectonics at all levels, there were new illustrations that I came across from speaking to colleagues and observing colleagues teach, that I was able to incorporate into the scheme to support pupils in grasping some of these really complex ideas. So, to help teach the concept about gravity and the weight of the tectonic plates causing movement, I observed a colleague demonstrate to her class how a necklace with a heavy pendant on it, when hanging off of the table, slowly edges further towards the floor, which is great illustration to help the pupils understand how gravity acts on heavy materials.\n\nWe don’t want to reinvent the wheel and there are lots of great materials about. I incorporated lots of materials I had successfully used previously to teach the scheme. However, I also added in new materials from well-researched and reputable sources, to add rigour to the unit. And then having another subject specialist check over the unit and give their insight meant I was able to make some further revisions to the scheme which made it more robust. Time invested into the scheme’s planning pays dividends later on.\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - How did you seek out the expertise of colleagues and existing resources when designing this scheme of work?\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  There are many different approaches to how the ‘curriculum’ is delivered in\n  EYFS, with some settings providing all pre-planned, adult-directed learning\n  opportunities and others following a freer, more ‘in-the moment’ approach (see\n  Anna Ephgrave for more information on this). Personally, I try to use a\n  mixture of both, taking lots of opportunities to follow pupils' lead and\n  empower them to run the play whilst setting out key new learning\n  opportunities. It is hard to separate the curriculum between those discrete\n  whole class learning opportunities and the ‘activity’ time when pupils are\n  learning through play. I find the design of each are quite different.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This series of lessons focus around the Ghanaian traditional tale, “The\n  Leopard’s Drum.” Due to the holistic nature of the EYFS you will find elements\n  across the curriculum evident in the provision planning, but the adult input\n  sessions around this theme were predominantly English based. When planning any\n  unit of work, it is important to ensure that you have accurate information and\n  knowledge around the topic and try to make use of specialists where you can,\n  whether that be colleagues, parents or the pupils themselves. In the context\n  of this series of lessons I was able to reach out to parents of two children\n  in my class who were able to offer support in terms of their personal\n  experiences of Ghana. Firstly, they supported with correct pronunciation of\n  the characters in the text as well as supporting their children to prepare\n  presentations on both Ghanaian food and dress. This not only supported the\n  crucial link between home and school but empowered these students to take more\n  of a lead in their learning. These sessions provided a great hook and made the\n  otherwise slightly abstract concepts more tangible to the class as a whole.\n  There are many resources out there to help with creating lesson plans and\n  ‘activity’ ideas from Pintrest and Facebook groups to Twinkl and TES. Whilst\n  these are all useful sources of ideas I often find them a bit overwhelming.\n  It’s hard to avoid getting swept up in the fun activity ideas, “Can you create\n  an elephant from a paper plate?” instead of focusing on the learning\n  objectives and curriculum, “manipulates materials to achieve a planned\n  effect.”\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Before I start each new text, I take some time to look at the vocabulary that\n  is being used, see if there are any new concepts or any opportunities to\n  change the text slightly to provide a more interesting synonym. I find this\n  works particularly well when doing a Talk 4 Writing project (see Pie Corbett\n  for more on this). We need to have high expectations of our pupils; and ensure\n  we are teaching them the correct vocabulary and facts surrounding their\n  learning. Young children often learn misconceptions or inaccurate information\n  that they have to then re-learn in later life, something which is much harder\n  to do. In the context of this series of work it was a great opportunity to\n  teach a wider range of vocabulary such as, “huge,{\" \"}\n</span>\n<i>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magnificent</span>\n</i>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  {\" \"}\n  drum\".  We know that the vocabulary gap is significant between children from\n  disadvantaged backgrounds and their more affluent peers (see Alex Quigley for\n  more on this) so, as educators I think we need to do as much as we can to\n  empower young children with a wide range of lexicon. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  However, we do not need to reinvent the wheel and do everything from scratch.\n  Once you are aware of your core text and have thought about where the gaps are\n  in your cohort’s learning. Do they need more opportunities to develop their\n  fine motor development? Or perhaps they need a bit of extra support in their\n  self-confidence so you need to incorporate more public speaking opportunities;\n  then plan backwards from these gaps to look at the resources out there that\n  can help you to create these learning outcomes.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n**The key take-away here is: don’t reinvent the wheel.**\n\nAs you work through this module, seek out existing resources from colleagues, professional networks, and online.\n\nKeep asking yourself:\n\n- **Which of my colleagues might have resources they can share with me on this?**\n- **Are there any other colleagues in my school or wider professional network who could support me with this?**\n- **What resources do my school or multi-academy trust have access to that could be useful here?**\n- **Which websites might have high-quality resources I could adopt and adapt for this scheme of work?**\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.1 A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning.\n\n_3b.

Whilst the unit of work that I am going to discuss is\n  predominantly literacy focused, you will notice that the environment planning\n  covers a range of areas across the curriculum. Obviously, part of the\n  Reception year is geared towards ensuring that children are supported for the\n  transition into year 1 and are able to meet their Early Learning Goals and\n  achieve a good level of development. However, planning a curriculum has to be\n  much more than a check list of outcomes.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  These lesson plans try to ensure a balance between children building on their\n  prior knowledge and creating links, as well as introducing them to new\n  concepts and skills. There is a big debate in education over a knowledge-rich\n  or skills-rich curriculum, however, in EYFS the two are arguably much more\n  intrinsically linked and perhaps defining them as such is just an issue of\n  semantics. The entirety of the EYFS should be a cumulative curriculum which is\n  why I always start planning a unit of work by first looking at where the\n  pupils need to get to in relation to where they currently are, what skills and\n  knowledge they have already gained, and then work on closing that gap.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  This topic of ‘The Leopard’s Drum’ provided me with lots of opportunities to\n  introduce new ideas, linked to the physical geography of Ghana and the concept\n  of folk tales, whilst ensuring that the key themes that were already of\n  interest to my pupils, such as animals and oral retelling were developed\n  further.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nNow we will focus on identifying the essential concepts, knowledge and skills for your scheme of learning. To help you to do this, we will highlight attention on two types of knowledge in particular: foundational knowledge and vocabulary.\n\n## Foundational concepts and knowledge\n\nEnsuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed. Foundational concepts – also known as “threshold” concepts – are key ideas that have the potential to unlock a pupil’s understanding of a subject.\n\nWithout an understanding of such foundational concepts, pupils will struggle to grasp future learning in that subject (Enser, 2018).\n\nHence, explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within a subject area is beneficial and should be designed into the curriculum.\n\nEvery subject has foundational concepts that form the basis of a pupil’s mental models. These concepts are often introduced to children early on in their education to be revisited and built on as they grow and develop their mental models.\n\n$I\nFor example, in geography pupils need to master the foundational concept of tectonic plates in order to build their understanding of this key subject area throughout their education:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The concept of tectonic plates may be introduced to children in the Early\n    Years, where they may paint pictures of exploding volcanoes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    In Key Stage 1, pupils might learn about famous historical examples of\n    volcanoes and earthquakes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    In Key Stage 2, pupils might learn about the different tectonic plates\n    around the world and how these led to the types of natural disasters they\n    encountered in Key Stage 1.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    In Key Stage 3, pupils might learn about how volcanoes and earthquakes are\n    caused by the movement of tectonic plates.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    At Key Stage 4, pupils may learn about how the direction and speed of\n    tectonic plates moving relative to one another determines the type,\n    magnitude, and frequency of tectonic activity.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    At Key Stage 5, pupils may learn how scientists monitor the movement of\n    tectonic plates in order to predict and alert people to potential\n    earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    At university, students might learn about plate tectonic modelling and they\n    may go on to write their PhD thesis on the constraints of tectonic\n    subduction.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nAs you can see from this example, the concept of tectonic plates is revisited at different stages of a pupil’s education, each time building on the knowledge that has come before. This enables pupils to learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge and incorporating them into their mental models.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\nIn module 5 we looked at how every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills. One part of this is teaching vocabulary.\n\nEvery subject has unfamiliar vocabulary that needs to be taught to ensure pupils can access the curriculum and explain their emerging thinking and ideas. From a subject point of view, pupils’ literacy is best developed by focusing on high-utility words (the words that are most useful to know in our subject area) and high-frequency (the words that are used most frequently).\n\nWe also need to teach pupils Tier 3 subject specific vocabulary like “tectonic plates”, “magnitude”, or “subduction” in geography, and Tier 2 academic vocabulary like “criticise”, “analyse” and “therefore” – or with younger children what we might think of as ‘wow words’ like “exaggerate”, “glean” or “mysteriously”. Identifying and teaching this vocabulary as part of the scheme of work is critical for successful learning.\n\n## Reflection\n\n$CTA\nListen to Maria or Emily talk through how they identified the foundational concepts, knowledge and skills of their schemes of work.\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/j2LjwJK3tP4)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nIdentifying the foundational knowledge – Emily Maule\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Foundational concepts and knowledge are the building blocks to any scheme and\n  in geography. When planning the year 7 plate tectonics scheme, I created a\n  knowledge organiser, which included the foundational concepts and knowledge\n  the pupils would need. I selected these by writing out the key things that I\n  needed pupils to know by the end of the scheme. These are the things that if\n  pupils didn’t learn them, I would feel they had been short changed.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  For example, foundational knowledge included the structure of the earth and\n  how the crust is broken up into segments that are constantly moving. This\n  knowledge is fundamental to this scheme but also to their future learning in\n  the subject, and so I need to ensure that pupils finish the scheme confident\n  in this concept. Another example is that in geography, pupils are often\n  required to think through cause, effect and response. These appear throughout\n  the subject and so I needed my pupils to be secure in these concepts by the\n  end of the scheme. For example, for a volcanic eruption, the cause is the set\n  of tectonic processes that lead to the rise and eruption of magma, volcanic\n  gas and other volcanic materials, and the effects are the results of that\n  volcanic eruption, such as deaths, injuries, water pollution from the ash, and\n  the destruction of buildings and communication systems. Finally, we look at\n  how people respond to the disaster, including actions like search and rescue,\n  rebuilding works and environmental restoration programmes. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  These foundational knowledge and concepts also included specific examples of\n  tectonic events, where pupils are able to study the causes, effects and\n  responses to particular tectonic events. In this scheme pupils look\n  particularly at the Fuego Volcano eruption in Guatemala in 2018. And detailing\n  this information on the knowledge organiser means that the pupils and I have a\n  clear picture of the core knowledge, concepts and skills pupils need for\n  successful learning.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - How did you identify the foundational knowledge for your scheme of work?\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  As we’ve discussed previously, the EYFS works as a cumulative curriculum, so\n  lots of the foundational knowledge that I wanted children to achieve during\n  this scheme of work was a continuation of their Prime and Specific areas of\n  development. Oral re-telling of stories is a key part of the Reception year;\n  it increases vocabulary and awareness of story structure, as well as their\n  self-confidence, listening and attention. Research has taught us that before\n  you can write something, you have to be able to say it, which is why this\n  series of lessons is an effective tool for early writing, alongside a strong\n  phonics scheme. However, in addition to these cumulative skills which develop\n  across the year, each unit also has its own specific foundational knowledge.\n  In the case of ‘The Leopard’s Drum,’ this was related to the geography and\n  traditions of Ghana, as well as native animals. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The EYFS curriculum surrounding this aspect of the curriculum simply states,\n  “Children know about similarities and differences in relation to places,\n  objects, materials and living things. They talk about the features of their\n  own immediate environment and how environments might vary from one another”\n  (Development Matters). This leaves a lot of scope for the practitioner to\n  identify which places and discussion points to cover. This was a topic that I\n  had not taught before, so I started by doing some research myself and thinking\n  of the key facts and misconceptions around it that I wanted pupils to know.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The concept of location is quite a difficult one to grasp when aged four and\n  five years old, and I wanted my students to have a real grasp of where Ghana\n  was and understand that it was another country. This meant that we first\n  needed to establish some more tangible knowledge based on where they live and\n  where our school is and then if any of them have family and friends who live\n  abroad. This concept is one that will be revisited many times, so it is\n  important that it is explained clearly to avoid misconceptions. We looked at\n  modes of transport and explored how one might travel to Ghana and how long it\n  would take in order to give them some context. Our whole school approach to\n  oral re-telling is to use British Sign Language (BSL) signs and so the key\n  vocabulary and appropriate signs formed part of the foundational knowledge. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The foundational knowledge also linked to other areas of the curriculum. Here\n  we used inspiration from the theme to expand their knowledge particularly in\n  Express Arts and Design. Children were introduced to Ghanaian artwork, in\n  particular the use of patterns, which we then used to create our own designs,\n  exploring using different media for a purpose and embellishing our creations\n  to improve them. This development of ideas was the next step in embedding\n  Characteristics of Effective Learning for many pupils.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\nNow think about your own scheme of work and consider the questions below:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What big ideas of the subject or key concepts is this scheme building\n      upon?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What follows this scheme and what new content do pupils need for\n      successful learning in the future?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTherefore:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What essential concepts, knowledge and skills do you want pupils to learn\n      in this scheme of work?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary will need to be revisited or taught to\n      pupils?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nYou could also think about:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Is there additional knowledge, skills or values that would support or\n      enrich the learning in this scheme?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      An estimate of how much time will be needed to teach and learn this scheme{\" \"}\n      <em>\n        (there may be existing time restrictions, in which case you will need to\n        prioritise the most important concepts, knowledge and skills){\" \"}\n      </em>\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nRecord your responses in a format that suits you (e.g. note-form, table, diagram\netc.)\n\nShare your responses with your mentor at your next meeting.\n$CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.3 Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.\n\n3.5 Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.\n\n3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.\n\n_3a.

To do this, we need to:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Sequence content so that pupils secure foundational concepts and knowledge\n    before encountering content that builds upon this\n  </li>\n  <li>Revisit the big ideas of a subject over time</li>\n  <li>\n    Draw explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles\n    in the subject\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n$I\n\nKeeping the metaphor of a roadmap in mind will help you stay focused on the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of the content to be taught, which should support you to think about the most logical teaching sequence.\n\n## Planning for assessment over time\n\nIn module 4 you learnt about how to use assessment and feedback to greatest effect. This included the point that effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.\n\nYour scheme of work will be providing the framework and guide to the teaching and learning of your topic over a period of time. So, your scheme needs to build in enough space for formative assessment activities to inform the teaching and learning of the concepts, knowledge and skills as the scheme progresses. Returning to the metaphor of a roadmap, this ensures teachers can respond to pupils’ needs and adjust the ‘route’ as the scheme is taught.\n\nAdditionally, there will be critical moments in your sequence of teaching and learning where it will be necessary to check that pupils have understood foundational concepts or knowledge before moving on.\n\nYour school will also use a range of assessments and these will look different depending on the phase, subject and year group you are planning this scheme of work for.\n\n$I\nA scheme of work is likely to include some assessment opportunities, such as:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Formative assessment tasks or activities linked to the over-arching learning\n    objectives of the scheme of work\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    And, possibly, a summative assessment task at the end of the teaching period\n    (such as a test or an essay or performance piece) to showcase the learning\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nHowever, it will not detail all the classroom practice, including all assessment activities, that a teacher will carry out. If it did, it would become a very unwieldy guide, but most importantly it could restrict a teacher’s ability to respond to the needs of their pupils. Learning is unpredictable and a scheme of work will be unable to anticipate how the learning will unfold for all pupils.\n\nWhen planning for assessment in your scheme of work, teachers using the scheme should be clear about the decision(s) it will used to support (e.g. whether to move on or re-teach a concept) and be able to justify its use.\n\n$CTA\nUse the questions below (adapted from module 4) to help guide your planning of assessment:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      At what points in the scheme of work should learning objectives be\n      assessed to inform future teaching and learning?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What would be a good method of assessment?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What will teachers do with the information?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      How are teachers going to feed back the information to pupils?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Sequencing essential concepts, knowledge and skills - activity\n\nWatch the video of Emily (Primary and Secondary) or Maria (Early Years) explain how they sequenced their scheme of work.\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/WbZk8B9xCHs)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nSequencing a scheme of work - Emily Maule at Reach Academy\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\nWhen planning a scheme of work, once you have decided on the foundational concepts, knowledge and skills, you have to then decide how to order them.\n\nThere is real skill to doing this as the sequencing can make or break a pupil’s overall engagement and understanding. A poorly sequenced scheme is like a TV series that is jumping around, that you can’t follow, where you are expected to already know things about the characters or plot that you haven’t yet been told. This is very frustrating for viewers and is similarly frustrating for pupils.\n\nWhen thinking about sequencing, I have found it helpful to think about building from the ground up and never assuming any knowledge. If the knowledge is key, then it needs to be explicitly taught, or we run the risk of widening the educational gap. This means when I think I have my starting point, I carefully check that I am not relying on pupils knowing or understanding a concept that I haven’t explicitly taught, or a skill I am assuming they have that I have not explicitly practised with them.\n\nFor example, the lesson on how earthquakes take place requires a solid grounding on the structure of the earth and how tectonic plates behave, so it has to come after the lessons that teach those elements. But it has to come before the lesson on the effects of earthquakes because pupils have to be able to understand the mechanics of earthquakes to understand why the effects can be so severe.\n\nFinally, I think it is better to cover less material but in a more thorough way, rather than doing a cursory glance over a very broad array of things, which pupils won’t be able to remember or engage with sufficiently. Allowing breathing time in case something needs to be revisited is an important element of this. So, I think one of the most important skills in designing a curriculum is discerning what to exclude as much as what to include. There is never enough time to do everything!\n$EndContent\n$EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - How did you sequence your scheme of work?\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Once you have assessed the pupils’ current level, any prior knowledge they\n  have linked to the topic, their current skill set in both prime and specific\n  areas that are linked to the scheme of work, understood where you want them to\n  get to, the foundational knowledge to be obtained and progression of key\n  skills, you can work out how best to get them there. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  We know that pupils need many opportunities for daily and weekly retrieval, so\n  this is key when sequencing a scheme of work. In addition to this, crucially\n  for younger pupils, we also need to consider their attention span and think\n  carefully about using every moment effectively and referring to material as\n  frequently as possible throughout the day, not just during the core lessons,\n  to help build up their schema.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  When thinking about sequencing in English specifically, I think about first\n  ensuring the key building block or central information for the given theme. In\n  the context of this scheme of work, it was knowledge of the text. Once we had\n  established “The Leopard’s Drum” as our new story then it was easier to link\n  everything else back to that, e.g. our story is set in Ghana, let’s find out\n  some more information about that, in the story Nyame wears a patterned cloak I\n  wonder if we can discover more about Ghanaian patterns? Having the story\n  cemented first allows everything else to flow together a lot more and helps\n  maintain the holistic element without it becoming too disjointed for the\n  pupils. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Crucially, I think it’s important to remember that you can’t cover everything,\n  especially when working in EYFS! As discussed earlier, one of my favourite\n  things about the EYFS is how it is so unpredictable. I have always carefully\n  designed my curriculum to cover the EYFS and introduce my pupils to a wide\n  range of life experiences, however, sometimes a tooth falls out in the middle\n  of your lesson and it’s okay to stop the lesson and use their enthusiasm to\n  introduce letter writing and compose a note to the Tooth Fairy altogether\n  instead! I find that I often see the best learning happen during their play\n  and it is the job of a skilled practitioner to take the key learning to them\n  by sometimes ignoring planning and following the children’s interests.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\nYou are now going to use the following points to guide you through sequencing the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and vocabulary in your own scheme of work.\n\n- Begin to organise the content (concepts, knowledge, skills) into a logical order\n- Identify where you will be introducing new content (including new vocabulary)\n- Identify the explicit links to draw between this new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject (i.e. pupils’ prior knowledge and the big ideas of the subject)\n- Identify assessment opportunities\n\nUsing this order you can start to:\n\n- Formulate learning objectives to be achieved across the scheme of work\n- Begin to estimate the time it will take to teach each learning objective _(an objective could run over a number of lessons)_\n- Plan in assessment opportunities\n\n$CTA\nWhen you have finished your first attempt at sequencing your learning objectives and associated content, ask yourself these questions:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">\n      Will pupils master foundational knowledge and knowledge required for later\n      content?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Is the flow of the curriculum logical and coherent?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Do the learning objectives ensure that pupils’ thinking is focused on the\n      key ideas within the subject?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Is there enough time for the content to be well-taught, e.g. enough time\n      for pupil practice and formative assessment?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      If assessment opportunities are identified, is the purpose of the\n      assessment clear?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nReview, edit, and then share your teaching sequence with your mentor at your next\nmeeting. $CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.\n\n_3b.

In this and the following session we will look at how, through careful curriculum design, you can help your pupils to master these important concepts, knowledge and skills. We will be drawing upon and applying knowledge from modules 3 and 4 to help you to do this.\n\nSecure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively. This is because it is through an understanding of how to teach a subject (often referred to as pedagogical content knowledge) that teachers develop:\n\n> ‘The most useful forms of representation of those ideas, the most powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and demonstrations—in a word, the most useful ways of representing and formulating the subject that make it comprehensible to others.’\n>\n> (Ball and others, 2008)\n\nThis type of subject knowledge also includes an understanding of what makes a topic easy or difficult and the likely misconceptions pupils will bring to the learning of a topic.\n\nIn this section we are going to think about how you can use your subject knowledge, and the experience of other colleagues, to increase the likelihood that your scheme will lead to successful learning for your pupils. We will focus on common misconceptions and the most useful ways to represent and develop understanding of the concepts, knowledge and skills in your scheme of work.\n\n## Anticipating common misconceptions\n\nIn module 3 you learnt how process questions are more likely to reveal pupil misconceptions, and in module 4, how to monitor pupil work for misconceptions. In this module we are going to focus on how you can work to anticipate and tackle common misconceptions as part of careful curriculum design.\n\nA misconception is a wrong or inaccurate idea based on faulty thinking or understanding. A common misconception is a wrong idea that many people have. For pupils, the most important common misconceptions to anticipate are the ones which relate to foundational concepts. This is because misconceptions can be difficult to shift but doing so can lead to big gains in learning, particularly for threshold concepts (Education Endowment Foundation, 2018).\n\nTherefore, anticipating common misconceptions within subject areas is also an important aspect of curriculum knowledge and working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.\n\n### Here are some examples of common pupil misconceptions:\n\n$I\n\n<h4>\n  <strong>Science (Biology)</strong>\n</h4>\nMisconception: all cells are the same size and shape.\n\nCorrect idea: different cells can have different sizes and shapes.\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h4>\n  <strong>Geography (Plate tectonics) </strong>\n</h4>\nMisconception: The earth’s plates are made of solid rock that can never be seen because\nthe plates are always deep within the earth.\n\nCorrect idea: Earth's plates are made of solid rock, and they can be seen where they are not covered by soil, loose rocks, or water.\n\n<em data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">\n  [The above examples were taken from: AAAS Project 2061\n  http://assessment.aaas.org/topics]\n</em>\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h4>\n  <strong>Modern Foreign Languages (French) </strong>\n</h4>\nMisconception:  J’ai is translated as ‘I am’\n\nCorrect idea: J’ai is translated as ‘I have’.\n\nThis misunderstanding stems from pupils learning that ‘J’ai onze ans’ is translated as ‘I am 11 years old’; j’ai is used in this context leading pupils to think that ‘j’ai’ means ‘I am’.\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h4>\n  <strong>History </strong>\n</h4>\nMisconception: thinking capitalism is synonymous with democracy.\n\nCorrect idea: capitalism is an economic system, and so capitalist economies can operate in dictatorships &amp; other non-democratic regimes, as well as in democracies.\n$I\n\nSo good curriculum design includes being aware of common misconceptions and this requires secure subject knowledge:\n\n> “The most effective teachers have deep knowledge of the subjects they teach… As well as a strong understanding of the material being taught, teachers must also understand the ways students think about the content, be able to evaluate the thinking behind students’ own methods and identify students’ common misconceptions.”\n>\n> (Coe and others, 2014, page 2)\n\nConsequently, when embarking on a new topic with pupils, it is good practice to first consider your own subject knowledge and any potential knowledge gaps you may need to close, particularly those concerning foundational concepts and knowledge. It might sound obvious but making sure your subject knowledge is secure is one of the best ways to enable you to teach the content well and help pupils to master the critical components of the subject.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Identifying subject knowledge gaps</h3>\nReview the content of your sequence of work and record any potential knowledge gaps\nor areas you want to strengthen.\n\nIf you have identified a need for subject knowledge development, be prepared to share this with you mentor and discuss the best steps you can take to address it.\n$CTA\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nReflect on the following questions and then record your response:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Can you recall any misconceptions that you have held in the past?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What helped to change your thinking?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Tackling common misconceptions\n\nIt is important to remember that adults hold misconceptions as well as children. Pupils needs to feel comfortable to share their ideas with you, so that you can support the development of their thinking over time. So, an important way in which you can help pupils to master foundational concepts and knowledge is to foster a classroom climate where the sharing and discussing of ideas is encouraged.\n\n$I\nIn terms of your teaching practice, here are some other ways you can respond to common misconceptions:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Explicitly address misconceptions through explanation</li>\n  <li>Provide evidence that might conflict with their thinking</li>\n  <li>Provide activities to support them to restructure their thinking</li>\n  <li>Use formative assessment to check that pupils’ thinking is changing</li>\n  <li>\n    Revisit misconceptions to remind pupils of what they thought in the\n    beginning and acknowledge how their thinking has changed\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nBelow you will see an example of a misconception that is common for Primary pupils when learning about partitioning to add. This is followed by a part-whole model which can be used to help pupils to master the concept.\n\nIn Key Stage 1, it is common for pupils to misunderstand the place value of digits within numbers. This is problematic when solving calculations because it means they are highly likely to make errors.\n\nFor example, when teaching pupils to partition two-digit numbers to add or subtract, they will sometimes partition like this:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt 28 can be partitioned into 2 and 8. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/partioning-28-a.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n…instead of this:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt 28 can be partitioned into 20 and 8. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/partitioning-28b.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThis occurs because pupils do not have a secure understanding of the value that the digits represent.\n\nIn order to prevent this misconception from developing, it’s important to support and develop pupils’ understanding of number using concrete objects or representation when first introducing pupils to the strategy of partitioning to add. There are several ways you could do this, but one way is to use a part-whole model:\n\n$Figure\n$Alt Example of the part-whole model using the number 28. The number 20 has already been added to the lower left field, the lower right field is blank ready to be filled in. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Part-whole-model.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 1: Part-whole model. $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nThe ‘whole’ – 28 – is represented at the top and the ‘parts’ are represented in the circles attached to the whole. Pupils could be provided with blank models to fill out or partially completed ones like the one above. They can be given Dienes blocks or place value counters to explore partitioning the numbers and identifying relationships between them.\n\nAs you can see this teaching strategy has been carefully thought about and planned into the scheme of work because the misconception is a common one for pupils. Discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils to master important concepts will support you to identify the most effective teaching methods.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\nReflect on the following questions and then record your response.\n\nReview the concepts in your sequence of work.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>What common misconceptions are pupils likely to have?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      What would help pupils to develop their thinking and to master the\n      concepts?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Can you identify any analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations or\n      demonstrations that could help?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nPrepare to share your reflections, along with any ways of representing those concepts,\nwith your mentor. $CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.2 Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively.\n\n3.4 Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.\n\n_3e.

The importance of spending enough time guiding pupil practice (through explanations and modelling) before moving onto independent work was emphasised. You also explored how the use of concrete examples and non-examples can be used to support pupils to understand a more abstract concept.\n\n$CTA\nWatch the video of either Emily (Primary and Secondary) or Maria (Early Years) talking through how they developed pupils’ knowledge over the course of scheme of work.\n$CTA\n\n$YoutubeVideo(https://youtu.be/W2JV2Oh2ORQ)$EndYoutubeVideo\n\nDeveloping pupils' knowledge throughout a scheme of work – Emily Maule\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo transcript\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\n\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Scaffolding builds pupils’ skills and confidence and helps them to realise\n  that they can use their prior knowledge to move forwards.

As an abstract concept it makes little sense to pupils learning this\n  for the first time. However, when presented with the cartoon of two cars of\n  similar sizes in a head-on collision, showing both car bonnets crumpling,\n  pupils are then immediately able to understand what is happening with the\n  collision plate margin. And then, knowing that tectonic plates can be imagined\n  as cars in collisions, they then have an understanding of the concept which\n  they can use to predict what might happen at the margin between other tectonic\n  plates.\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n   And I think that sometimes, the more creative you can be with the\n  illustrations, the more likely it is that pupils will remember the\n  illustration. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Another favourite example from a different scheme is used when teaching about\n  air pressure. Pupils (and teachers!) often find the global atmospheric\n  circulation system difficult to get their head around, with the behaviour of\n  air pressure and the resulting weather particularly challenging. To help\n  illustrate how air pressure affects weather I use an example that always makes\n  pupils laugh and so helps them remember. I’ve even seen pupils discretely\n  re-enacting the illustration in exams! I ask them to imagine they have a puppy\n  on the table in front of them and I ask them to visualise themselves with\n  their hands above the puppy, moving their hands in an upwards direction away\n  from the puppy, as I tell them that their hands represent the air. Following\n  some questioning they can tell me that upwards moving air and the resulting\n  low pressure that is applied to the puppy, makes for unstable weather, as\n  demonstrated by the wriggling and moving puppy. I then ask them to imagine\n  they are applying downward pressure to the puppy and ask them how high\n  pressure will affect the puppy – and usually they are able to say that the\n  puppy will stop moving as much, and so see how high pressure creates stable\n  weather conditions that are not moving or changing. It is a bit of a silly\n  illustration but definitely helps pupils visualise how air pressure affects\n  the weather conditions.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - How have you developed pupils’ knowledge over the course of the scheme of work?\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  One of the wonderful, but challenging, things about the EYFS is that there is\n  no statutory knowledge that children have to acquire by the age of five. There\n  are some common themes that you will see occurring in most settings e.g.\n  Traditional Tales. Again, it is important to refer to the guidance and see\n  what needs to be taught. For this series of lessons, I not only wanted to\n  support pupils’ English development but also link that to their development of\n  Understanding the World, specifically, “they know about similarities and\n  differences between themselves and others, and among families, communities and\n  traditions.” It was important, therefore, to provide opportunities to explore\n  both the text itself and the context within which it was written. I chose this\n  this text due to the large proportion of Ghanaian students within my class\n  group and was fortunate enough to be able to draw upon their families’\n  experiences who provided support and personal accounts of the country and its\n  culture. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  For a large proportion of students, this topic, along with most others,\n  presented them with new ideas and information that they hadn’t previously\n  encountered; some of them were slightly more abstract. It was therefore really\n  important to ensure that there were as many concrete examples as possible in\n  this story. In the context of ‘The Leopard’s Drum’ we used music to explore\n  the ‘huge, magnificent drum’ and share ideas as to why it would have been so\n  popular among the other animals. Creating opportunities to make these cross\n  curricular links also extended the children’s schema enabling more chances for\n  retrieval and recall. This was also done by sharing videos and images of Ghana\n  itself to explore animals in their natural habitat which was useful as we had\n  previously studied ‘Handa’s Surprise’ which had some similar animals as\n  characters but provided opportunities to compare and contrast two African\n  countries. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  One of the key objectives of this lesson series was to be able to re-tell the\n  story. There was therefore a lot of scaffolding that was put in place at the\n  start of the week i.e. a story map. This scaffolding empowered students with\n  the confidence they needed initially, and then as the week went on, I\n  gradually removed the scaffold until all students were able to confidently\n  retell the story independently.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n## Reflection\n\n$CTA\nNow review your scheme of work, considering the questions below:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      With a focus on your learning objectives, where do you need to build in\n      time for teacher input, guided practice and independent practice?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Where would it be helpful to interleave concrete examples and non-examples\n      to support pupils’ understanding of an abstract concept?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nPrepare to share your evolving scheme of work with your mentor. $CTA\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n_3f.

And then for subsequent schemes in year 7, I quiz them on previous\n  material to keep that knowledge alive. Referring back to prior learning also\n  reminds pupils of its importance.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The second strategy I use in all schemes is the use of concrete examples and\n  illustrations to help pupils engage with abstract concepts. For example, in\n  this scheme when teaching about volcanic hazards, I support the teaching of\n  abstract concepts such as lava flows with concrete examples and images so that\n  pupils can engage with the material and draw on anything relevant they might\n  have stored in their long-term memory – even from films or books they have\n  read or seen. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  A third strategy is the intentional teaching and revisiting of tier 2 and 3\n  vocabulary. I repeatedly revisit the vocabulary so that pupils are continually\n  exposed to it. For example, starting off using technical language such as\n  tectonic hazards, tectonic plates, mantle, pressure and friction means that we\n  can use the correct terminology from the beginning and build up pupils’\n  familiarity with it throughout the scheme. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Finally, in this scheme, as with all schemes, I have sought to balance the use\n  of exposition with pupils practising skills and knowledge, whilst always\n  narrating the links between new content and the core concepts. These features\n  of classroom practice help pupils to learn and build confidence, instead of\n  new content causing them to panic and then retreat.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$Accordion\n$Heading\nVideo script - How have you planned to develop your pupils’ mental models across a scheme of work?\n$EndHeading\n$Summary\nThe final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.\n$EndSummary\n$Content\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Despite the fact that we teach topics/themes/core texts that break up the\n  year, the vast majority of the EYFS is one long continuous curriculum that\n  runs from birth to year 1. Thinking of it like that helps to remind\n  practitioners of the need to build up pupils’ mental models across the EYFS,\n  as they need to frequently revisit their learning and make those cross\n  curricular links to develop now and be able to achieve success in learning as\n  they get older.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  The key way that I do this is through the explicit teaching of vocabulary,\n  both topic specific and general conversation. In our setting both high\n  frequency words and new story nouns are introduced and repeated with an action\n  to help our students who struggle with communication to also retain the\n  vocabulary. This is an approach that is used throughout the school, as we know\n  that the use of consistent non-verbals (such as ‘yes’ and ‘no’) allows\n  students to free up some of their working memory. I try to use BSL as\n  frequently as possible for this, i.e. in our retelling of ‘The Leopard’s\n  Drum’, we used the BSL signs for each of the animals. These signs then acted\n  as a piece of scaffolding for students who needed it when retelling the\n  story. \n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, I use retrieval practice in both this\n  series of lesson and all (see Rosenshine for more on this). Quizzing is\n  something that I initially found challenging to incorporate into EYFS but\n  found that once I had dedicated a considerable amount of time to  embedding\n  the routines with pupils, i.e. TTYP, Show Me (see TLAC for more on these AFL\n  techniques) I discovered that it was an incredibly useful strategy to ensure\n  children were retaining key knowledge and vocabulary from previous sessions.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n  Finally, in this scheme, as with all schemes, I made sure to create lots of\n  opportunities for modelling following an, I do, We/You do approach. My EYFS\n  works in a way that not all students will engage in the same activity at the\n  same time as we need to develop the whole child and think of their\n  Characteristics of Effective Learning. However, this being the case it is\n  crucial that all students have the chance to observe and participate in\n  writing opportunities. Writing is particularly important as we can see from\n  data that that is the area where most children struggle to achieve.\n  Pre-writing activities and talk in particular, such as we see in this scheme\n  with opportunities to re-tell and engage in class discussion, are key. More\n  students are entering school working below the expected standard for\n  Communication and Language, so we need to first embed these prime areas before\n  moving onto the specific.\n</span>\n$EndContent $EndAccordion\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  <strong>Reflection</strong>\n</h3>\nNow review and edit your scheme of work, considering the questions below:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Where will you build on pupils’ prior knowledge?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Where would it support pupils’ understanding to use worked and partially\n      completed examples?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>How will you build in spaced exposition and practice?</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Where will you build in retrieval practice?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nWhen thinking about the last two questions, it is important to think more broadly\nabout where your scheme fits into the wider curriculum. For example, you may want\nto include practice of information taught in a previous scheme of work, or the retrieval\nof knowledge previously taught. Working with colleagues to facilitate this will support\nthe overall sequencing and coherence of your curriculum.\n\nPrepare to share your evolving scheme of work with your mentor.\n$CTA\n\n## The difficulty of transferring knowledge\n\nWhen thinking about supporting pupils to build increasingly complex mental models, it is important to understand that pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context. This is particularly relevant for curriculum design, as we may want to make use of, and bring attention to, the links between different subjects and our own. This can enrich the curriculum and support pupils to build their mental models; however, because of the point above it needs careful thought and planning.\n\nFor example, we might want pupils to use their mathematical knowledge in a geographical context and assume that they can transfer their knowledge of the use scale factors and maps to a geography task. This assumption is understandable, but pupils are unlikely to be able to do this well because ‘the use of scale factors’ is an abstract idea and they are being asked to use this knowledge in an unfamiliar context. This assumption can lead to a frustrating experience for both teacher and pupils.\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  From what you have learnt across the modules so far, what do you think the\n  teacher could do to support pupils to transfer their knowledge from one\n  discipline to another?\n</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\nPlease record your ideas.\n\n$CTA\n\n$I\nBelow are some ways the teacher, in the previous example, could support the transfer of knowledge:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Check that pupils have the foundational knowledge of scale factors and maps\n    that is required\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Check that pupils have the foundational geographical knowledge required\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Draw explicit links to this prior knowledge and support pupils to bring the\n    right ideas from their long-term memory into their working memory\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Provide examples of this knowledge being used in a maths context (that they\n    are familiar with) and a geographical context (which is new) and get pupils\n    to compare examples\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Use worked examples and partially completed examples to support pupils to\n    apply their prior knowledge in this new context\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>How do these suggestions compare with your own ideas? </strong>\n$CTA\n\n## Thinking critically within a subject area\n\nAnother important reason for thinking carefully about what concepts or knowledge should be taught in a curriculum is that we often want pupils to think critically within a subject. However, for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of the knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. If we don’t explicitly teach the relevant domain-specific knowledge, our pupils are likely to struggle with any activity that requires critical thinking.\n\nWe are going to use a cooking analogy to help us to understand this idea. Let’s think about the ‘dish’ as the demonstration of pupils’ critical thinking about a subject area. Let’s then think about the ‘ingredients’ that are used to produce this dish as the relevant domain-specific knowledge.\n\nFirstly, if pupils do not know what the ingredients are, they are very unlikely to be able to make the dish! However, often we will tell pupils what the ingredients are and expect that this will be enough for them to be able to make a dish. In order to think critically, or in this analogy use the ingredients to cook, they need to have these ingredients easily at hand.\n\nFor our pupils this means that they need to have enough relevant subject knowledge in their long-term memory to draw upon in order to think or ‘cook’ well. The more developed pupils’ mental models are, the better able they will be draw upon the knowledge or ‘ingredients’ when they are asked to think critically. In other words, pupils will be able to cook a far more successful and satisfying ‘dish’!\n\nAnother pitfall for supporting pupils’ critical thinking is to focus too much on the process or the product of their critical thinking. For example, spending a disproportionate amount of time on learning how to structure a critical essay or looking at model answers, rather than spending enough time to help pupils master the domain specific knowledge required to think well about the subject area. To use the above analogy again, we might spend a lot of time learning about how to use the kitchen appliances or follow the steps of a recipe, but without good knowledge of the ingredients and their properties, we would be unlikely to be able to cook anything that was edible or tasty.\n\nYour upcoming training session will focus more on how to help pupils apply knowledge and skills to other contexts.\n\n## One final word about curriculum\n\nDuring this module, you have designed a carefully sequenced and coherent scheme of work. This will act as a guide for you and any other teachers you share it with. When it comes to teaching your scheme of work, remember that it serves you best as a _roadmap_.\n\nA roadmap will show the destination (the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the content to be taught) and the best route to get there (the teaching practices and materials most likely to lead to successful learning). As you begin to follow the roadmap you have planned out, remember to be flexible, adjusting your route to the needs of your pupils as the scheme unfolds.\n\nViewed in this light, your scheme of work should be a dynamic and evolving guide. As you are teaching it, reflect on what’s working well and what isn’t. Make adaptations to it as you go, responding to the strengths and needs of your pupils as they emerge. Keep a note of these changes and add comments to help you to evaluate the success of the scheme as whole. That way, you can make amendments and improvements for the next time you teach it.\n\nNote that one key indicator of the success of a scheme of work is that, at any stage, you can explain why you are teaching something, and your pupils understand why they are learning it. If we understand how a scheme of work links to the bigger picture, we can help our pupils to make these connections and the learning becomes more motivating and meaningful for everyone.\n\nFinally, it’s worth adding the best curriculum design happens when teachers work together. So, proactively seek out opportunities to work with other teachers, contributing to curriculum development in your school and beyond.\n\n## Related ECF strands\n\n### Subject and curriculum\n\n3.6 In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about.\n\n3.8 Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.\n\n_3f.

These can be considered as foundational to your teaching because they address how you set up your classroom as a learning environment. As you work through the weeks of this module you will reflect on the different ways that you can influence your environment, and learn practical strategies that keep pupils safe, motivated and focused on learning.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>A new year and a fresh start</h3>\nSam is excited – and nervous – about starting a new job in September. At her current\nschool she is happy: pupils respect and trust her, see her as a role model, and know\nthat she believes in them.\n\nHowever, it took Sam a couple of years to reach this point and she knows she made some mistakes along the way. To make the most of her fresh start, Sam’s current mentor suggests that she considers how to communicate her expectations to her new pupils and create a positive learning environment from day one.\n\n<strong>\n  What do you think Sam should consider in order to embed expectations early on\n  with her new classes, in order to recreate the respect and trust she had\n  fostered at her old school?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nTeachers can be extraordinarily influential – you can improve the motivation, wellbeing and behaviour of your pupils. In turn, this will help you to improve their life chances, especially for the most disadvantaged pupils. Ultimately, the quality of your teaching is what matters most, but creating secure foundations by acting as a role model, clarifying your expectations, and creating a culture of trust and respect will help your teaching to have the greatest possible impact. You can do this by:\n\n- **acting as a role model** – your actions can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of your pupils. For instance, modelling a joy of reading may influence your pupils’ attitudes to reading. Therefore, you should be purposeful and consider the attributes you wish to foster through your example. Pupils may be especially impressionable if they identify with you, or if they lack existing positive role models\n- **clarifying your expectations** – your expectations of pupils can affect their outcomes. This is sometimes known as the Pygmalion effect, through which pupils can internalise expectations of them held by others. Setting challenging, yet achievable goals will help you to communicate your high expectations and support pupils to achieve more. You should set similar expectations about behaviour by, for instance, not tolerating low-level disruption\n- **creating a culture of respect and trust** – this can be achieved by doing lots of simple things well, such as actively modelling and reinforcing the courteous behaviour you expect pupils to show you and their peers. For instance, by respectfully listening to others’ ideas and actively modelling how to do this and why it matters\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A culture of trust and respect</h3>\nJust like in Sam’s previous school, the first time she set a collaborative activity\nfor her new class, she spent time discussing and agreeing with them a set of class\nrules aimed at fostering a culture of respect and trust. Rules included ‘listening\ncarefully to others’ views’ and ‘respecting each other’s views’. Taken together,\nthe rules that Sam’s class agreed helped to reinforce their shared value about the\nimportance of fairness.\n\nThe rules were similar to those from previous years, but this time Sam paid more attention to the details of how these rules were embedded with the class, having learnt how important this is. For instance, she systematically modelled the rules with her own behaviour, sometimes exaggerating this for effect. Furthermore, Sam reinforced the rules by highlighting successes and reminding pupils consistently of expectations if they violated the rules. As part of reinforcement, Sam also emphasised the positive link between time on task and learning.\n\nOver time, Sam’s pupils began to remind each other about the rules, and the culture of respect and trust helped all pupils to succeed. Notably, it became much easier for Sam to teach and for pupils to learn in these conditions – the initial investment of lesson time was worth it for its overall benefit across the year.\n$I\n\n**Routines** are a sequence of actions regularly followed. School life is full of routines and teachers can influence these routines so that they are both effective and efficient – this helps to maximise the time available for learning. Routines can also help create a predictable and secure environment for all pupils, which may be particularly helpful for pupils with special educational needs.\n\nRoutines can be helpful in many different situations. These will depend to an extent on your own context. Common situations where routines are useful include:\n\n- **transition points** – moving from one activity to another, especially when physical movement is needed, such as younger pupils moving from working at tables to sitting on the carpet\n- **using equipment** – excess time taken in distributing and gathering equipment is time that could be better spent learning, so establishing efficient routines is important here\n- **entering and exiting lessons** – simple routines to support entry and exit include the use of seating plans and ‘board activities’ for pupils to begin as soon as they enter the classroom\n- **collaborative and paired work** – pupils benefit from clear routines to support them to work effectively and efficiently together. Working with others is most impactful when pupils are clear about how to do this well – for example, having defined roles for each member of a group; clarifying strategies for contributing and listening to ideas within the group; and establishing processes for feeding back outcomes to the class at the end of the task\n- **safety** – different subjects pose different risks, but establishing routines, such as how pupils wear goggles in science, can help maintain safety for everybody\n\n**Establishing and maintaining routines**, like any behaviour, takes effort – especially in the early stages of working with a new class. It can be helpful to think of this as a four-stage process; the speed and emphasis placed on each stage will depend on your pupils’ characteristics, your classroom context and the focus of the routine. It may be necessary to re-model or provide further practice if adherence to a given routine decreases over time.\n\n- **clarify** – begin by clarifying exactly what the routine involves and why you are using it. For instance, the aim of the routine may be mainly about maximising time for learning safely\n- **model** – show pupils how to perform the routine and explain its purpose, highlighting the core principles or elements of the routine. It can help to show non-examples that represent common misinterpretations of the routine as part of this\n- **practice** – scaffold opportunities for practice when first using the routine. Including an element of competition may be appropriate here – for example, timing groups of pupils to see who can clear away equipment and be ready to exit the classroom in the least time\n- **reinforce** – regularly reinforce the routine by acknowledging when it is done well and providing reminders and further practice where it is not\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Establishing and maintaining a routine for gluing in sheets</h3>\nFollowing her mentor’s advice, Sam spent some time thinking about the routines that\nshe wanted to establish with her new class. One area where she needed a stronger\nroutine was gluing sheets into pupils’ books. Initially, Sam thought it might be\ntoo trivial an action to focus on, but on reflection she found that it really did\nmatter to her.\n\nToo often in the past, this had been a slow process which some pupils did so ineffectively that their books were messy or resources got lost. Sam had even found herself sometimes gluing in sheets when she was marking books, which was a poor use of her time. This time Sam was clear with her new pupils about the routine she wanted to embed:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>clarify</strong> – Sam clarified to pupils how she wanted sheets\n    stuck into books: open, not folded; edges inside the book, not hanging out;\n    a single line of glue around each edge, not across the whole sheet. Sam then\n    thought about the routine pupils needed to embed to achieve this. She\n    already kept glue sticks on the table, but she added in a stage of peer\n    checking, too\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>model </strong>– Sam explained to pupils why the routine mattered,\n    which included showing the class two old exercise books: one where the\n    routine had been followed, and one where it had not. Sam also modelled the\n    process using her visualiser and a volunteer peer checker, and pointed out\n    common mistakes as well as how to avoid these\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>practice</strong> – Sam purposefully built in time for practice\n    during the first weeks of term. As she built in peer checking of books it\n    naturally became a little competitive and pupils enjoyed trying to glue in\n    their sheets both efficiently and effectively\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>reinforce</strong> – the peer checking became a powerful way of\n    reinforcing the routine and this also contributed to the wider class culture\n    of high expectations. Sam also regularly reinforced the rationale for the\n    routine and its link to pupils’ learning. If sheets had not been glued in\n    correctly, Sam provided targeted reinforcement of her expectations\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\nTo make the most of your routines, consider the following questions:\n\n- What is the purpose of each routine?\n- What – exactly – do you expect to happen during each routine?\n- How will you provide sufficient high-quality practice for each routine?\n- How will you reinforce each routine?\n\nYou could then consider each routine from your pupils’ perspective:\n\n- Do pupils understand the purpose of each routine?\n- Do pupils understand, exactly, what to do with each routine?\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n- the practices that you are already doing well\n- the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n- the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan: 15 mins\n\n#### Analyse artefacts / discuss with a colleague\n\nSpend some time exploring the culture and values of your school, then capture what you think are the main features of this culture / these values in a way that suits you. This could be in a short narrative, a bulleted list or a diagram, for example.\n\nTo help you, you might:\n\n- read paperwork that outlines your school’s culture and values – for example, staff induction documentation or promotional materials (you could also look on your school’s website for this information)\n- walk around the building and notice what this tells you about the culture and what is valued. What is on display, and on noticeboards? What is celebrated? How do staff and pupils interact with each other?\n- speak to a colleague who has been at the school for a while and ask them what they feel characterises the culture and values of the school\n\n### Theory to practice: 15 mins\n\n#### 1. Observe a colleague\n\nAs you have read above, how you set the expectations in your classroom will significantly shape the learning that happens within it. Arrange to observe the beginning (first 5 minutes) of an experienced colleague’s lesson. Make brief notes on all the ways that this colleague communicates their expectations about attitudes, values and behaviour in their classroom. Ask your mentor to suggest a suitable colleague, if necessary.\n\nTo shape this observation, you could look out for:\n\n- How the colleague manages entry to the room: how do pupils enter? Do they line up first? Is entry controlled in any way? What happens if pupils are not following expectations?\n- What pupils do on entry to the room: do they have a routine for dealing with their bags and outdoor coats? Do they sit down immediately? How quickly do they settle? Is there work or an activity ready for them to get on with?\n- How the teacher communicates their expectations verbally and non-verbally: what words do they use? What tone, volume and pitch? How are facial expressions and gestures used to communicate with pupils?\n- How the colleague uses aspects of the model described above: clarify; model; practice; reinforce\n\n#### 2. Scripting\n\nUse the ideas in the research and practice summary above, and your notes from this session so far, to script your own routine for how pupils will enter your classroom. If relevant to your setting, you may want to consider the role of parents and carers as part of this, too.\n\nYour script should address the ‘clarify’ and ‘model’ stages of the process described in this week’s research and practice summary. Include in this script:\n\n- your expectations about how pupils will enter the room: will they line up? Where? Who decides when pupils enter? What will happen if pupils aren’t following expectations?\n- instructions you will give pupils about what to do on entry: how will they deal with bags and coats? Will they sit down immediately? What are your expectations about how quickly they settle? What should pupils ‘do’ once they are settled?\n- how you will model your expectations to your pupils\n- notes for yourself on how you will create opportunities for pupils to practise your new routine\n- notes for yourself on how you will communicate your expectations verbally and non-verbally: what language could you use to greet different pupils? How will you use tone, volume and pitch? How will you use facial expressions and gestures to help reinforce your expectations?\n\nBe as specific as you can in the detail you give. The purpose of this activity is to help you think in detail about how you can set clear expectations about behaviour on entry to your classroom, and create a predictable and secure environment that supports effective learning.\n\n### Next steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your script and any notes you have made from the other activities in this session to your mentor meeting this week. Be ready to discuss your script with your mentor and work together to refine it further. You will have a chance to rehearse this script with your mentor before putting it into practice in your teaching.\n\n", nil, "7ebb371c-b799-4827-b4be-b4af116d5eec"],

We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Behaviour in KS3 design technology</h3>\nToby teaches design technology and only teaches each of his Key Stage 3 classes once\nper week. Behaviour is especially important in design technology, both for pupils’\nlearning and their safety.\n\nToby knows that setting and reinforcing consistently high behavioural expectations is important, but he lacks confidence about how to do this, especially as he does not see his classes very often. This makes it harder to establish effective relationships.\n\nToby asks a senior colleague, Muhammad, for advice. <strong>What strategies do you think Muhammad might suggest?</strong>\n$CTA\n\nYou saw last week how maintaining high expectations, particularly about behaviour, is important. This week you will further examine practical techniques that you can use to do this.\n\nDemonstrating consistently high behavioural expectations can help you to create a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils. Doing this will support pupils’ overall school experience, improving their learning and reducing opportunities for bullying.\n\nTo consistently demonstrate high behavioural expectations, you should:\n\n- **create a culture of respect and trust** – this can be achieved by doing lots of simple things well, such as actively modelling and reinforcing the courteous behaviour you expect pupils to show you and their peers. For instance, by respectfully listening to others’ ideas and actively modelling how to do this and why it matters\n- **teach and maintain your expectations** – explicitly teaching and reinforcing your expectations is important. Last week, you used the ‘clarify, model, practice, reinforce’ framework to establish routines. You could also apply this to your expectations about behaviour\n- **use school policies** – schools typically have detailed policies and procedures, especially relating to rules, sanctions and rewards. Ensure that you understand and apply these policies consistently and fairly. This will support pupils to understand your high expectations, provide predictability, and support your colleagues in using the same policies\n- **acknowledge pupil effort and progress** – maintaining appropriate behaviour is harder for some pupils than others. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and praise when pupils are making an effort and to try to link this to the progress pupils are making. For instance, ‘Lucy, well done for focusing and settling down to work quickly today. I can see how hard you’re trying to follow the rules. You’re getting faster at this, which means more time for your learning’\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Using school systems and colleagues for support</h3>\nAs Toby has limited time with each of his classes, it is harder for him to demonstrate\nand rigorously reinforce his high behavioural expectations. Muhammad suggested that\nit is particularly important for Toby to follow the school’s policies closely, as\nthis will help pupils more easily transfer what they already know about expectations\nof their behaviour to Toby’s lessons.\n\nMuhammad suggested that Toby spend some time using the ‘clarify, model, practice, reinforce’ framework to think about the behaviours that are particularly relevant to design technology. Muhammad worked with Toby to specify, script and rehearse important subject-specific behaviours about safety and listening to instructions, which dramatically improved behaviour and the climate for learning in Toby’s lessons.\n\nMuhammad also clarified key aspects of the school’s behaviour policy with Toby and showed him some tips for ensuring that he followed through with sanctions and rewards using the school system. Muhammad explained that he made a note of behaviour ‘events’ in his planner after each lesson and then spent 10 minutes at the end of each day adding these to the school’s information management system, so that his colleagues could understand and respond to patterns of behaviour for different pupils. Toby saw how this system could work for him and ensure that behaviour, positive and negative, was consistently followed up and reinforced.\n\nMuhammad reassured Toby that it was his job to help him and it was not a sign of weakness for Toby to ask for help – it is part of a being a professional to work collaboratively with colleagues. If Toby needed support, especially with managing disruptive pupils, he knew he could ask for assistance and training from senior colleagues.\n$I\n\nTeachers have significant influence over the culture in their classrooms. To maximise learning and pupils’ school experience, you should aim to create a positive, predictable and safe classroom environment. Predictability is especially important for pupils as it helps to reinforce your high expectations of behaviour. A key way of developing this predictability is to consistently apply rules, sanctions and rewards in line with your school’s policy, and to escalate matters as appropriate.\n\nFairness is an important part of predictability and it is something that pupils are acutely aware of, so focusing on it will help to ensure the legitimacy of your rules and expectations for behaviour.\n\nTo create a positive learning environment, you can:\n\n- **be predictable** – schools use sanctions and rewards in many different ways to reinforce desirable behaviours. The success of any system will be determined by its implementation, and predictability is a key part of this. For instance, sanctions that are only enforced sometimes will be less effective than those that always, predictably, follow a certain behaviour. Being predictable helps to reinforce the school’s high expectations of pupils\n- **be aware** – awareness is important for preventing low-level disruption as well as for quickly managing bullying or other behaviours that threaten pupils’ emotional safety. To maintain awareness, you should position yourself physically so that you can visually monitor the whole class even when speaking to an individual or small group, and frequently ‘be seen looking’ so that pupils know you are aware of what they are doing\n- **be responsive** – responding early to low-level disruption usually helps to shut it down quickly. ‘Least-intrusive’ approaches – i.e. those which limit disruption to learning, including non-verbal signals – can be appropriate at this stage, such as pausing abruptly, moving physically closer to disruptive students, or looking at pupils to show that you know what they are doing and that it is not acceptable (the ‘teacher glare’)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Responding early using the least-intrusive interventions</h3>\nMuhammad invited Toby to come and see one of his own classes where he was working\nhard to reinforce positive behaviours. Toby watched intently as Muhammad explained\na key learning point:\n\n‘Victorian society became incre…’\n\nMuhammad paused abruptly – mid-word – and looked calmly and directly at two pupils who had begun to talk to each other. The pupils immediately stopped, refocused, and Muhammad resumed his explanation with minimal disruption to the whole class, having reinforced his high expectations of behaviour.\n\nToby noted how the abrupt pause instantly got the attention of the disruptive pupils with only minimal interruption to learning. Afterwards he reflected on what he had seen and asked himself, ‘how can I use that approach?’\n$I\n\n**Giving instructions** can be challenging for all teachers, as they need to ensure that all pupils understand what is expected of them. Fortunately, the way that instructions are given can ensure more pupils understand them the first time. If pupils misunderstand instructions, this will waste lesson time and can lead to disruptive behaviour. It can also leave pupils feeling excluded and, in some situations, pose a risk to pupils’ safety.\n\nInstructions given to pupils should be:\n\n- **manageable** – pupils’ working memory is limited, so it can help to give instructions both orally and visually. With practical tasks, for instance, you may include a written or visual representation of the method in addition to verbal instructions, which pupils can refer back to and check their understanding\n- **sequential** – think about how you sequence instructions so that the right information is given at the right time. Where possible, providing instructions at the point they will be needed is useful. For instance, you can break up instructions for multi-phase activities so that instructions for later phases are only given once pupils have completed earlier phases\n- **specific** – ensure pupils understand what exactly it is you expect of them. It can be helpful to consider at the planning stage how your instructions may be misinterpreted (i.e. ‘what could go wrong here?’), and use this to provide the right level of specificity when teaching\n- **check understanding** – after giving instructions, it can be helpful to briefly check that pupils understand by asking questions such as, ‘what should you do if/when…?’ This should be given higher priority in the case of complicated instructions and for pupils who frequently struggle to understand instructions\n- **consistent** – there are some instructions that you will give often, such as getting the attention of a class to ‘bring them back’ from independent or group work. It can help to use consistent signals for this. For instance, you might use a specific phrase, a countdown or a non-verbal instruction such as raising your hand to gain attention\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Give better instructions</h3>\nGiving clear instructions is a really essential part of Toby’s job. After examining\nthe evidence about clear instructions, Toby gave much more consideration to how he\nensures all pupils understand what he expects.\n\nToby thought it was particularly important to give clear instructions when pupils were doing practical work, because of both the risks to safety and the potential for difficulty in regrouping and guiding the class as they moved around the workshop.\n\nToby decided to script out some instructions that he would give ahead of beginning practical work. As he often needed to give instructions like this, he decided having a consistent approach would be useful, and that he could adapt this approach to the context of each lesson. ‘Victorian society became incre…’\n\n<strong>\n  Thanks everyone [pause for silence].

Before we begin I want to check we\n  know what we need to do. It’s important that we are all clear so that we can\n  work on this task safely and effectively.\n</strong>\n\n<strong>\n  [Ask targeted questions to clarify key points from the instructions.] For\n  example:\n</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Vicky, what can people do to remind themselves if they get stuck?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Louise, why is it important to remove the dust before we paint?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      Chris, what are the tricky bits of the task that you’ll need to watch out\n      for?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Finally, does anyone have any questions before we begin?</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBy carefully structuring his explanations, and building in checking for pupils’\nunderstanding, Toby improved the quality of his explanations, which maximised\nthe time for safe learning. After thinking more about how to give instructions\neffectively, Toby devised the following questions to help:\n<ul>\n  <li>what are the key things pupils need to understand?</li>\n  <li>\n    what are the likely misinterpretations and how will I both avoid and check\n    for these misunderstandings?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    should the instructions be given all at once, or will it help to phase them?\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins\n\n#### 1. Practical exercise\n\nRead the scenario below. Use this to test and extend your thinking around approaches to establishing the learning environment.\n\n- At each numbered point of the scenario, complete the table at the end of the text, using the information in the research and practice summary above and your learning from last week’s sessions. The first row has been completed as an example of the sort of answers you might give. You will need to copy the table into your notes so you have space to fill it in.\n- Once you have completed the activity, review your responses by reading the commentary at the end of this session plan. Update your own responses as necessary.\n\nThe scenario has been written so that it can be interpreted in the context of any phase. You should consider the case in the context of your pupils, school context and specialism.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Managing a smooth start to lessons</h3>\nIt’s early in the first term of the academic year. You are finding that when pupils\narrive at your classroom, it takes up to 10 minutes for them all to arrive and become\nsettled and ready to start (1). There are particular pupils who are consistently\nthe last to arrive at the lesson, by which point you just want to get started in\norder to engage the class in their learning (2). The staggered start to the lesson\nis eating into important instruction time and creates an unsettled atmosphere, which\nyou then find difficult to eradicate (3). When you begin the lesson, you find that\nthere are some pupils who are not focused (e.g. whispering to one another, fidgeting\nwith equipment and clearly not actively listening) which often means you need to\nrepeat instructions, explain things again, or have some pupils who are ready to move\non and some who are unable to because they weren’t focused (4). $I\n\n| Point | **What is happening here?**                                                    | **What decisions must the teacher make?

Reflection\n\nHaving completed the activity above, reflect on how this connects to your own practice and how you can draw on learning from this exercise to improve your approaches to establishing the learning environment.\n\nYou might ask yourself:\n\n- which points of the scenario resonate most strongly with your own experience?\n- which points of the scenario would you be most/least confident in addressing?\n- who in your school could help you develop your practice further in areas covered in this scenario?\n- what immediate change can you make in your practice to improve the way that you communicate behavioural expectations and shape your classroom environment?\n\n#### So what could you do in this scenario?\n\n1. Setting out clear expectations at the start of a new year is a powerful way to ensure consistency in your lessons. Decide how you want your lessons to begin – perhaps there is a school policy where all pupils must line up in silence outside the classroom, or perhaps you are allowed to choose how the lesson starts. Identifying a clear expectation which you reinforce every lesson will foster a calm and purposeful start to your lesson.\n2. Find out why the pupils are late to your lesson by talking to them calmly, outside of lesson time away from the view of the rest of the class. Consider your school policy on punctuality – apply the appropriate sanction to deal with the late pupils, and continue to do so each time they are late, escalating your response as necessary if this is a repeat occurrence.\n3. Preparation is key here. Set the expectation that there will always be the same routine at the start of each lesson. For example, pupils enter quietly and sit at their desk, remove their coats and get their equipment out for the lesson. It may be a good idea to have a task ready for them to engage with immediately, such as a quiz on prior learning, a ‘big question’ that requires deep thought, or perhaps responding to feedback in their exercise books. This will set the tone for a calm and purposeful lesson.\n4. Again, this is about ensuring there are clear expectations which you consistently reinforce, ideally through modelling the behaviour you expect from pupils. The example in the research and practice summary of stopping instruction abruptly and looking pointedly at those not listening can be an effective strategy. It would also be appropriate to praise pupils who do conform to your expectations. Furthermore, you may want to reflect on the quality of your explanations – are they sufficiently structured and concise? As with the issue of punctuality, apply your school’s policy in managing the situation, initially aiming for the least-intrusive action but escalating issues as appropriate in line with the policy.\n\n### Next steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your notes from this activity to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor. Use your learning in this session to make at least one positive change to how you establish the learning environment in your lessons over the coming week.\n\n", nil, "96bd295b-30b9-454a-b3cb-15fba38be040"],

This week you will see how teachers can influence wider outcomes, which are important both in their own right and because they are associated with long-term success in education. This includes self-regulation, motivation and resilience.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Observations and conclusions</h3>\nAfter another difficult Year 8 geography lesson, Amy is concerned about her pupils.\nShe hoped that her enthusiasm for geography would quickly develop pupils’ love of\nlearning geography, but this does not seem to be happening.\n\nAmy has decided that as some pupils seem unwilling to complete challenging activities, she needs to make her lessons more exciting in order to appeal to them. After their first end-of-topic assessment had disappointing results, Amy concluded that her pupils must lack motivation to learn. She decided to explore ways to improve their motivation.\n\nAmy’s mentor challenges Amy to more clearly separate out what she observes in her pupils’ behaviours and the conclusions she draws about why they behave in this way. The mentor cautions Amy against drawing unfounded conclusions about pupils’ experiences, as she has done here, and reminds her that there are many plausible explanations for why pupils behave as she is observing.\n\n<strong>\n  What might be going on for Amy’s pupils in the situations she is experiencing?\n  What factors might be behind what Amy is observing in her class? What\n  strategies might she use to engage her pupils more effectively in their\n  learning?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Self-regulation** refers to a pupil’s ability to monitor, evaluate and modify their emotions and behaviours. This includes, for example, controlling emotions of anger, frustration or embarrassment – all common emotions experienced by pupils across their school career. The most effective learners are able to effectively regulate their own emotions, meaning they are better able to learn well, and to form positive relationships with others. If pupils struggle with this it can affect their own learning and future lives and may also negatively affect their peers.\n\nThe Education Endowment Foundation report that – on average – pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and lower-attaining pupils, are less effective at self-regulation than their peers. Therefore, explicitly teaching self-regulation may be particularly beneficial for these pupils.\n\nPupils’ self-regulation depends on their prior knowledge and their stage of development. However, developing pupils’ self-regulation is as important for early years practitioners as for teachers of older pupils – especially as it relates to the regulation of emotions, which supports successful learning.\n\nApproaches to developing pupils’ emotional self-regulation include:\n\n- using story books and discussing how characters may feel and why\n- developing pupils’ vocabulary to describe their emotions\n- teaching self-calming techniques, like deep breathing\n- supporting pupils to recognise their own body clues linked to strong emotions, like a changing tone of voice, hot face and increased heart rate\n\n**Resilience** refers to the ability to cope with and overcome challenges. Supporting pupils to overcome challenging goals, and to understand the connection between effort and success, can support the development of resilience. Meeting goals that are not sufficiently challenging or where pupils do not have to work hard is unlikely to develop resilience.\n\nResilience is linked to pupils’ beliefs about their **ability to succeed** – they are more likely to persist in the face of challenge or adversity if they believe that they will, eventually, achieve their goal. An important way that teachers can influence their pupils’ beliefs in this area is to create regular opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success. ‘Meaningful success’ could mean different things to different pupils – for some it will be working through a tricky activity on their own; others may value answering questions correctly in front of their peers. Where challenge is too low, success is unlikely to be meaningful. Challenge is a function of the learning goal of the lesson and the degree of support available to help reach this goal.\n\n### To help all of your pupils experience meaningful success on a regular basis, and develop resilience, you should:\n\n- pitch the learning goals of your lessons to be challenging enough for pupils that success has meaning (i.e. that it’s not too easy to succeed), but not so challenging that success seems out of reach\n- adapt the level of support, or scaffolding, available to all pupils – including both lower and higher attainers. This will help all pupils to master the challenge in the lesson, with sufficient effort to make success meaningful, and learn what you want them to learn\n- consider the range of activities in your lessons and how these play to your pupils’ respective strengths – if some pupils are more able to express their ideas orally than in writing, for example, exploit opportunities for them to ‘succeed’ through discussion at the same time as you work to develop their written literacy\n- be specific in your use of praise so that it is clear to pupils when and how they are ‘succeeding’ (e.g. ‘that was an excellent answer because…’ or ‘what an improvement since last week. You’ve really improved your…’)\n- praise pupils’ attitude and effort as well as outcomes of their work – emphasise the importance of learning behaviours that lead to success in the longer term\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Supporting pupils’ resilience and beliefs about success</h3>\nAmy reflected on her mentor’s feedback and decided to explore her pupils’ behaviour\nsome more. She observed them with another teacher and was impressed at how engaged\nthe class was in their learning, but she also noticed that many of the class seemed\nto ‘give up’ when they found some more difficult activities quite challenging. This\nled Amy to reflect on where the pupils might be struggling.\n\nAmy has decided that she needs to develop pupils’ resilience, so that they are more able to keep going with suitably challenging learning activities. After learning more about how teachers can develop pupils’ resilience, Amy decides that the first thing she needs to do is to pitch the learning goals appropriately. The school’s Year 8 geography curriculum is insufficiently challenging for some of Amy’s pupils so she plans ways to raise the challenge for these pupils.\n\nNext, Amy reviews the support that she gives to pupils. After reviewing pupils’ exercise books, Amy observes a group who seldom complete activities in full and often make quite significant errors in their work. Their exercise books are covered in red pen and points for improvement. Putting herself in these pupils’ shoes, Amy understands how rarely they must experience success in her class. Amy resolves to more effectively scaffold learning for these pupils and create opportunities for them to feel successful in their learning.\n\nAmy is already confident with how she uses praise – especially when it comes to praising effort and perseverance. Even so, Amy realises that she could be more specific with some of her praise and compare what pupils are doing now with what they have previously done to highlight improvements.\n\nTogether, these new approaches will help to develop pupils’ resilience and self-belief, which will help all pupils experience meaningful success.\n$I\n\n**Motivation** is important for pupils’ success at school and later life chances. It is usually defined as a kind of driving force that influences the selection, direction, and continuation or discontinuation of behaviours.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of two types of motivation: intrinsic motivation, related to pupils’ identity and values; and extrinsic motivation, related to reward and sanctions. Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyse one’s capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge. It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in a goal or task, and derives from the individual rather than relying on external implementation. Pupils who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in learning willingly, as well as work to improve their knowledge, skills and performance. Conversely, extrinsic motivation refers to behaviour that is driven by external factors such as grades, praise or the avoidance of punishment.\n\nSome forms of extrinsic motivation can very powerfully influence pupil behaviour, but it may also have undesirable consequences if pupils focus too much on the competition, and on ‘winning’ at the expense of intended learning. For example, pupils who rush to finish work ‘first’ may not think as carefully about their learning as they would if they were less motivated by the reward offered for speed.\n\nIn any scenario pupils will be influenced by both types of motivation, but developing pupils’ intrinsic motivation linked to learning will support their success because they will engage more willingly in their learning without the need for external validation.\n\nIt is important to recognise that motivation is not visible, and that it is easy to make assumptions about the motivations behind pupil behaviours that may not be correct. It is helpful to remain mindful of the difference between observable actions and hypotheses about the drivers of these actions. For example, a pupil who appears ‘lazy’ may in fact by struggling to focus because of events happening outside school in their family or friendship group, or because the work they are completing is not sufficiently challenging.\n\n### To increase pupils’ motivation, you can support them to:\n\n- **master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals** – success is motivating, especially when it is challenging to achieve and links with pupils’ long-term goals. For instance, accurately and judiciously using challenging, technical vocabulary in writing will motivate an aspiring journalist\n- **explore their long-term goals** – whether or not they articulate them freely, most pupils have long-term goals. However, there is often a mismatch between these goals and what pupils think they need to do to achieve them. Discussing long-term goals with pupils and linking this to their learning can be highly motivational. For instance, you may be able to make connections between pupils’ goals and their current learning that they are not aware of such as between the digestive system in biology and a pupil interested in becoming a chef. You might also highlight to pupils the value of transferable skills that they are developing, and where qualifications are a prerequisite to the career path that they wish to follow\n- **develop intrinsic motivation** – extrinsic motivation can be a very powerful driver, but it is not always sustainable for pupils in the long term – into adulthood – because it relies on an external source of reward and sanction. You should help your pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation towards having the intrinsic motivation to work without external input. As well as supporting pupils to master challenging content and connect learning to personal goals, you can help them to find interest and enjoyment in their studies. For instance, by demonstrating your own enthusiasm for what you are teaching, or through the pedagogical approaches you use\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Motivating reluctant learners</h3>\nMuch of what Amy is now doing will help to increase her pupils’ motivation as well\nas their resilience and self-belief. As pupils experience meaningful success more\noften, they will likely experience increased motivation, too.\n\nLike Amy, many teachers think that improving the motivation of pupils who are struggling will improve their learning. In fact, it often works in reverse – improving pupils’ learning improves their motivation.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 15 mins\n\nRead the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim both to refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins\n\n#### 1. **Reflection**\n\nUse the research and practice summary for this week to reflect on the pupils you teach. If you teach more than one class, choose just one as the focus for this activity.\n\nAs you review your pupils, consider these questions:\n\n- how would you describe this class overall in terms of their resilience, self-regulation and motivation? Try to be clear about (a) what you can observe and (b) the conclusions you draw from these observations\n- what variation exists within the class? Are there pupils who present quite differently to their peers? What implications might this have for teaching and learning?\n- what groups are there within the class in which pupils have similar characteristics relating to resilience, self-regulation and motivation? How might this influence your approaches to teaching this group?\n\n#### 2. **Practical exercise**\n\nNow select two pupils from the class who especially interest you. You might want to focus on one who you feel is particularly flourishing and one about whom you have some more concerns. Write a short description of each pupil. The purpose of this activity is to encourage you to consider in some detail how your pupils vary as individuals and how this has implications for your teaching.\n\nAs you draft each description:\n\n- think about what you have observed about this pupil in relation to their resilience, self-regulation and motivation\n- include relevant information that you know about the pupil – such as details they have told you about themselves, or which you have gained from liaising with parents, carers and/or colleagues\n- include hypotheses about how what you observe and know influences the pupil as a learner\n- consider how this pupil may experience learning in your class. For example, to what extent do they have the opportunity to experience meaningful success? Are they able to express their long-term goals and see how their learning helps to work towards these goals?\n\n#### 3. **Independent planning**\n\nUse your learning from this session so far to identify opportunities for you to intervene in meaningful ways with one or more of your pupils to influence positively their resilience, self-regulation and motivation.

This time in the school year is often tricky in terms of behaviour, so this week provides an opportunity to return to how you maintain your high standards of behaviour and respond appropriately to disruption.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Overcoming a difficult few weeks</h3>\nJames started in his new school in September. He is delighted with how effectively\nhe has established his high expectations and how well pupils have responded to these.\n\nHowever, as the October half-term approaches, James is increasingly aware that some of his expectations are being challenged by pupils. His mentor reassures him that this is very common and that it matters how he responds – this is an important opportunity for James to reinforce and maintain the strong start that he has made.\n\n<strong>\n  What should James think about to reinforce and maintain the high expectations\n  he has established?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nYou have already learnt about how to effectively establish your expectations. You saw how you can use the following four stages to establish and maintain routines and expectations for behaviour:\n\n- **clarify** – begin by clarifying exactly what the routine involves and why you are using it. For instance, the aim of the routine about handing out equipment quickly may be mainly about maximising time for learning safely\n- **model** – show pupils how to perform the routine and explain its purpose. It can help to show non-examples that represent common misinterpretations of the routine as part of this. For example, you can show how just one person in a pair should gather equipment in a science lesson, to minimise the number of people moving around the room\n- **practice** – scaffold opportunities for practice when first using the routine. Including an element of competition may be appropriate here. For example, challenging pupils to hand out books as quickly and quietly as possible at the start of the lesson\n- **reinforce** – regularly reinforce the routine by acknowledging when it is done well and providing reminders and further practice when it is not. This may be as simple as, ‘well done for settling down and beginning so quickly, Matthew – you’re already learning now’\n\nUsing this approach will help you to demonstrate your high expectations of pupils. However, you are likely now reaching the stage where careful reinforcement of your expectations is needed. It is natural for pupils to test the boundaries of your expectations, so it is important to manage your response to this well.\n\nIt can help to distinguish between situations where pupils are actively testing your boundaries and situations where pupils do not fully understand what you expect. Where pupils do not understand, re-modelling and practising are likely to be beneficial. In other situations you will need to consider how you reinforce your expectations.\n\nTo continue to reinforce your high expectations, as explored in week 3 of this module, it can help to:\n\n- **be predictable** – schools use sanctions and rewards in many different ways to reinforce desirable behaviours. The success of any system will be determined by its implementation, and predictability is a key part of this. For instance, sanctions that are only enforced sometimes will be less effective than those that always, predictably, follow a certain behaviour. Being predictable helps to reinforce your school’s high expectations of pupils\n- **be aware** – awareness is important for preventing low-level disruption as well as for quickly managing bullying or other behaviours that threaten pupils’ emotional safety. To maintain awareness, you should position yourself physically so that you can visually monitor the whole class even when speaking to an individual or small group, and frequently ‘be seen looking’ so that pupils know you are aware of what they are doing\n- **be responsive** – responding early to low-level disruption usually helps to shut it down quickly. ‘Least-intrusive’ approaches – i.e. those which limit disruption to learning, including non-verbal signals – can be appropriate at this stage, such as pausing abruptly, moving physically closer to disruptive students, or looking at pupils to show that you know what they are doing and that it is not acceptable (the ‘teacher glare’)\n- **review your expectations** – you will have set your expectations with the best of intentions, but it may be appropriate to carefully review them if pupils are struggling to do as you wish. You should avoid lowering your expectations, but it may be helpful to alter routines to make these expectations more achievable.\n\nBuilding effective, trusting relationships with pupils will help you to manage behaviour and create an environment that supports learning. This process will take longer to establish with some pupils than others and this is quite normal, especially if you are a secondary school teacher who sees individual pupils less frequently. It is easier to build these relationships when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood – even though you are ‘in charge’ of your classroom, you are also modelling how to develop and maintain positive relationships, and taking account of others’ feelings is, of course, an important part of this. This does not mean that you always have to do as pupils wish, but that you can positively impact your relationship with pupils by acknowledging their feelings and being clear about the reasons for the decisions you take.\n\nResponding consistently to pupil behaviour is important for two reasons:\n\n- **reinforcing expectations** – if you only sometimes reinforce your expectations in how you use sanctions and rewards, then pupils quickly learn that your expectations are optional. Over time, you will likely find that pupils adhere less and less to your high behavioural expectations\n- **fairness** – pupils have a strong sense of fairness, so if they notice (or perceive) they are being treated differently than their peers this can undermine your relationship with them. Therefore, it is important to ‘be fair’ and to ‘be seen to be fair’. This can include, for example, using least-intrusive interventions (see week 3 of Module 1) so that pupils don’t feel that they are being singled out in front of their peers, and linking your use of rewards and sanctions to the school behaviour policy. By being explicit like this, you make it clear to pupils why they are being sanctioned and others know what they need to do to achieve the rewards that their peers receive\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Setting pupils up to succeed: consistency and persistence</h3>\nJames was coming to dread his Friday afternoon lessons. It seemed that pupils could\nsense the weekend coming and were especially tricky to teach at this time. He felt\nthat two pupils in particular consistently caused low-level disruption that affected\neveryone’s learning, and were frequently off task. This upset James as he had worked\nso hard to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment in which all pupils\ncould thrive.\n\nJames asked his mentor to come and observe the class so that she could help James plan how best to tackle the problems he was concerned about.\n\nThe feedback from James’ mentor was surprisingly helpful. Not only did she offer some strategies for addressing the pupils’ low-level disruption, but she also highlighted the approaches that James had embedded that were supporting the majority of pupils to learn well – even on a Friday afternoon!\n\nJames had taken the time in September to carefully clarify, model, practise and reinforce the behaviours he expected from pupils, and his mentor could see that this was already paying off. She praised the way that he reinforced positive behaviours from pupils, and how he linked this to the school’s policy on sanctions and rewards. She highlighted to James that he was already doing lots of things well and could feel proud of this.\n\nJames’s mentor also suggested some strategies to work on. She felt that the disruption worrying James was stemming from the two pupils not always understanding clearly what they needed to do. This helped James to see that the most effective behaviour management strategy in this situation was not to respond to the disruption once it had happened, but to pre-empt it by making sure the pupils understood clearly what they should be doing.\n\nBased on this feedback, James set himself the following targets:\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    target the two pupils with clarification questions when giving task\n    instructions, to make sure that they fully understand expectations from the\n    outset\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    focus on using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common\n    directions in the classroom, so that he can more easily remind the pupils of\n    his expectations while they are working. This includes a non-verbal ‘shhh’\n    gesture for when they get chatty, which James can use without distracting\n    other pupils\n  </li>\n</ol>\nJames’ situation is not unique – all teachers experience these kinds of challenges\nfrom time to time, especially less experienced teachers. By consistently and persistently\napplying the principles you have learnt in this module, you will be able to address\nthese challenges and support all pupils to learn well in your class. Remember that\nyou are not alone in this endeavour and that you can expect assistance and support\nfrom colleagues, which can often make all the difference. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim both to refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n#### Practical exercise\n\nIn last week’s self-study session you wrote vignettes about two of your pupils. This week you are asked to write a vignette about your own practice, in which you ‘catch yourself doing something right’ – in this case, a situation in which you managed behaviour effectively. As you saw above, it can be easy as a new teacher to focus on what isn’t yet going well, but remember that you have many successes each day. It is as important to build on and sharpen your strengths as it is to address areas of relative weakness. Celebrate this example of your successful use of strategies for managing behaviour.\n\nTo help you write this vignette, you could:\n\n- describe the general situation – who was there, what was the broad setting\n- describe what you did\n- describe what happened\n- try and connect your actions to their consequences, using the ideas in this week’s research and practice summary and those from previous weeks in Module 1\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Example: tricky behaviour in Year 10 computing</h3>\n‘My Year 10 computing class can be tricky, particularly after lunch as lots of them\nplay football during the break and arrive hot and excitable. Often I struggle to\nget them to settle and this can ‘blow up’ into confrontation with some pupils who\noften accuse me of picking on them. Recently I have been starting the lesson with\na quiet, independent, writing task so that pupils have a chance to cool down before\nmoving to computers. I used the entry routine that I’ve been practising for a few\nweeks and this seemed to help them anticipate what would be happening. I can see\nthat they’re getting more used to my expectations and this is helping them to calm\ndown more quickly. A couple of pupils were being a bit chatty but I used physical\nproximity (walking casually towards the pupils) as a first reminder of my expectations\nand then a quiet 1:1 word with one of them when a second prompt was needed. I phrased\nmy reminder as ‘you need to be working quietly on this task’ rather than ‘stop talking’\nso that I was emphasising my expectations positively. By using strategies consistently\nwith all pupils I seem to be reducing some of the initial perceptions of unfairness,\nso there are fewer incidences where pupils feel they’re being picked on. I am pleased\nthat my consistency and tenacity seems to be paying off with this class.’ $I\n\nIn this vignette you can see that there are strategies in use both to pre-empt disruptive behaviour (planning of activities, use of predictable routines, clear expectations) and also to respond to disruptive behaviour as it arises (early and low-level interventions). These are contributing to a predictable, secure environment in which behaviour is managed effectively.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\n#### **1. Practical exercise**\n\nNow that you have identified where you are making successful use of strategies for managing behaviour, write a vignette that captures a specific situation that you found tricky in relation to managing behaviour. This could be about an individual pupil, a group or a whole class.\n\nAs above:\n\n- describe the general situation – who was there, what was the broad setting\n- describe what happened\n- describe what you did (before, during and after the event)\n- try and connect your actions to their consequences, using the ideas in this week’s research and practice summary and those from previous weeks in Module 1\n\nAll teachers have bad days, or situations within a day which they would prefer to have managed differently. It is important that you are able to reflect on events like these so that you learn from them and plan ahead for how you will use different approaches when you encounter something similar in the future.\n\n#### 2. **Reflection**\n\nUsing your two vignettes, reflect on how you could have taken actions before, during and perhaps after the second event to change the course of the situation. Visualise this event happening differently because you put different strategies in place before it happened and as it unfolded. Use this reflection to write a checklist for yourself of how you will approach tricky behaviour management situations in the future.\n\nTo help you write this checklist you could:\n\n- note how you can ‘design out’ poor behaviour through the use of routines, consistent language and the development of a supportive, predictable classroom environment\n- note how you can respond to poor behaviour quickly, consistently and with as little intrusion as possible\n- note how you can reset relationships and expectations after an incident of poor behaviour\n\n#### 3. **Independent planning**\n\nNow that you have worked through the contents of Module 1, you have the opportunity for your mentor to complete a developmental lesson observation of you putting your learning into practice. Begin to think about a lesson next week that you would value your mentor’s feedback on, and a specific focus from Module 1 topics that would most support your learning.\n\nMake some initial notes about this lesson and a possible observation focus. You will have the opportunity to discuss this lesson further in your next ECT mentor meeting.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your vignettes, your checklist and notes from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss your learning with your mentor.\n\n", nil, "fee2dcfb-57f6-4eab-8308-715f257029e5"],

You should pay specific attention to these areas as you work through the module sessions.\n\nIn this first self-study session, you will look at the impact of pupils’ prior knowledge on their learning (2.1, 2.2) and how knowledge changes through the cooperation of working and long-term memory (2.3). Information in working memory about a current activity (2.4) is linked to things pupils already know that are stored in long-term memory (2.5). You will work through an illustrative exercise to examine how prior knowledge in long-term memory is used to help reduce working memory load (2.4) and create new knowledge. This then provides the basis for further learning (3.5). You will also look at how weak, inaccurate or misapplied prior knowledge can have a negative effect on subsequent performance and learning (2.6, 3.4).\n\nYou should apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Drawing on long-term memory to support working memory in Year 9 English</h3>\nHasan is teaching Macbeth to a Year 9 English class of mixed attainment. He wants\nhis pupils to be able to explain the likely impact upon an Elizabethan audience of\nwitches appearing on stage in Act IV Scene 1. They studied the Witch Craze in history\nlast year, and they met Macbeth’s witches in Act 1 earlier this term.\n\n<strong>\n  How might Hasan prompt knowledge of witches from his pupils’ long-term\n  memories to support their achievement of this learning objective?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Knowledge** can be defined as familiarity, awareness or understanding of facts, information or skills. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject). Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: attention, perception, communication and reasoning; this can happen through experience or education.\n\nIf a pupil has a poor store of prior knowledge in their long-term memory (i.e. if they are a novice), they are likely to struggle to acquire new knowledge in lessons because their grasp of foundational concepts will not be secure and their working memory can become overloaded.\n\n$I\nHasan suspects that some of his pupils have poor or inaccurate knowledge of attitudes towards witches in the Jacobean period. What techniques could Hasan use to get a better idea of where pupils’ inaccuracies lie?\n\nAt the end of the previous lesson, Hasan did some quick-fire true/false questioning to quiz his pupils on their prior knowledge in their long-term memories and to bring misconceptions to the surface (e.g. ‘Witches lived in England in the past. True or false?’, ‘People believed witches conspired with the devil and had the power to change events. True or false?’).\n$I\n\n**Learning** can be described as a lasting change in pupils’ capacities or understanding. Sometimes learning is defined as a change in long-term memory; a wider definition of learning might include changes in knowledge, values and attitudes.\n\nMemory is an important factor in learning. Memory comprises two elements: working memory and long-term memory. The role of a teacher is to organise teaching so that it best supports pupils to process information in their working memory and store it within increasingly complex mental models in their long-term memory.\n\nRegular, purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.\n\nTo help your pupils to learn more effectively, you should:\n\n- build in opportunities for regular, purposeful practice of what has been learned (e.g. by getting into the habit of building practice time into all of your lessons. Practice can be done singly, in pairs or in larger groups)\n- help your pupils strengthen their long-term memories (e.g. for factual recall, by quizzing them to recall recent learning, and repeating this with longer intervals; for practical skills like catching or drawing, you can space their practice over a period of time)\n- anticipate misconceptions that are common within the areas you teach and develop ways of catching and correcting these (e.g. by using a series of focused multiple choice questions to identify common misconceptions; the nature of incorrect answers can inform your teaching, so these questions are sometimes called diagnostic questions)\n\nAn example of a common scientific misconception is that the seasons are caused by the Earth moving closer to the sun. A good diagnostic question would include this as a plausible incorrect answer alongside the correct answer. Misconceptions are inevitably subject specific. Therefore, discussing with experienced colleagues typical misconceptions, ways of identifying them and overcoming them will support your development as a teacher.\n\n**Working memory** is where information that is being actively processed is held. ‘Active processing’ can be thought of as being synonymous with ‘thinking’. The capacity of the working memory is limited, and it can be overloaded. (This is referred to as Cognitive Load.)\n\nInformation can enter the working memory either from the immediate environment or from the long-term memory. Having knowledge stored in the long-term memory therefore helps pupils overcome the limits of their working memory, allowing them to concentrate on the task in hand. Simply put: prior knowledge held in the long-term memory helps reduce working memory load. This enables pupils to think more efficiently using their working memory and to avoid cognitive overload.\n\nTo help your pupils avoid cognitive overloading their working memory, you can:\n\n- take account of your pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (e.g. in the previous week, do a quick diagnostic assessment using mini-whiteboards or do some true/false questioning)\n- break complex material into smaller steps (e.g. use partially completed examples to focus pupils on each specific step)\n- reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. removing unnecessary animation or images from a PowerPoint slide or simplifying and sequencing instructions so that they are clearly and logically stated)\n- remind pupils of what they have already been taught and how the new information that they are being introduced to relates to this (e.g. by explicitly comparing content in the current lesson to that in past lessons)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>What did Hasan do?</h3>\nIn today’s lesson, Hasan set up table discussions with these two questions: Why did\npeople believe in witches in the 16th century? What did people believe about a witch’s\npowers? He took feedback from table captains. This helped Hasan to gain a closer\nunderstanding of his pupils’ knowledge. He was also able to correct misconceptions\nin their long-term memories at this stage.\n\nTo prompt knowledge from their long-term memories (from earlier this term), Hasan then posed a series of short-answer questions for the pupils to answer and show on their mini-whiteboards. For example: How many witches appear in Macbeth? In which Act do they first appear? Who do they tell their prophecy to? Who saw the witches? How did the characters in the play react to the witches?\n\nHasan has now freed up space in his pupils’ working memories to work on the main task, which is about audience reaction to the witches. He shows them a Globe Theatre video about features of Elizabethan theatre, such as male casting, lighting, sound effects and being open to the elements. He then models for them what a good outcome might look like, identifying key features. Individual pupils write a first draft in this lesson, ready for some peer assessment and redrafting next lesson.\n\nThis lesson explicitly links what the pupils have learned longer ago and more recently to what they need to work on now. Hasan took 5 minutes from a previous lesson to check misconceptions in their long-term memories using true/false questions. In the main lesson, he used table discussion and short-answer questions with mini-whiteboards to bring to the surface the knowledge from their long-term memories and to free up space in their working memories. He then used a model to scaffold their writing and will use the next lesson to provide instant feedback through peer assessment.\n\n<strong>\n  Which of these strategies is Hasan likely to find useful in aiding his pupils’\n  working memories?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n4. which, if any, of the practices in Hasan’s lesson that you could adopt in your own\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins\n\n#### 1. Practical exercise\n\nThink about the following story, which is about the interplay of long-term and working memory. What might be happening mentally at each point:\n\n1. Bob is introduced to the parts of a cell in Year 7 biology. His teacher explains what each part does, what they look like and where they are found in plants.\n2. The next day, Bob applies what he learnt about cells to some questions about different types of specialised cells and finds this relatively straightforward. He understands why they are found in the leaves of plants, but not in the roots.\n3. Two weeks later, Bob’s teacher asks him what chloroplasts are. Initially, Bob struggles to recall what they are, but with a prompt from his teacher that they are green, Bob is able to recall what he previously learnt about chloroplasts.\n\nThis exercise is designed to provide a concrete example of how working memory and prior knowledge in long-term memory work together to create learning.\n\nDuring the first lesson, Bob is introduced to new content. As he thinks hard about the content, he begins to encode it into his long-term memory. The following day, he is able to easily recall the new information, especially with the prompts from his notes. Again, as he works through the problems, he strengthens the links between his new learning and his prior knowledge about plants.\n\nAfter two weeks, Bob initially struggles to recall the information, as it is no longer in his working memory. The prompt word chloroplast is not enough by itself to retrieve the information that he previously encoded in his long-term memory. When his teacher reminds him that chloroplasts are green, this is a sufficient prompt to enable Bob to recall from his long-term memory the things that he previously learnt.\n\nIn your own teaching, you may well have encountered circumstances where some pupils actually perform more poorly the second time they encounter a particular type of exercise.\n\n- How far might this be explained by the sequence described above?\n- How might you use checks on prior knowledge and practice work to reduce this?\n\nTo check on their prior knowledge, the second time they encounter a particular exercise, you could:\n\n- do a quick quiz of their previous learning -- you could reuse the same exercise or one that is similar\n- in pairs, get your pupils to rehearse ‘everything they remember’ about the prior exercise\n- give a quick recap of what they ought to have learned and follow up with one or two multiple-choice questions\n- ‘correct the teacher’ – deliberately quote to them the likely misconception and challenge the class to point out your mistake\n\nThese activities also have the added benefit of securing knowledge in long-term memory. You will also make use of the same scenario in week 4 of this module.\n\nYou will revisit some of these points in your next mentor meeting.\n\n#### 2. Independent planning\n\nConsider your lesson plans for the forthcoming week and identify one context where you can try to make deliberate use of the relationship between working memory and long-term memory, similar to the kinds illustrated by the activity above and in Hasan’s lesson about Macbeth’s witches:\n\n- identify the lesson or part of a lesson that you will focus on\n- write a simple plan for how you will make use of your learning about the relationship between working memory and long-term memory in this lesson or part of a lesson\n- annotate your plan to show why you have designed it in this way, including where you anticipate pupils’ misconceptions, and discuss these with your mentor when you show them your plan; where you can, connect your annotations to the Research and Practice Summary above\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your planning from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor, including raising any questions that have come to mind while completing this task.\n\n", nil, "d4866f93-7e6d-465c-8d60-72ef6d3e27a1"],

An understanding of the foundations of literacy learning is key to teaching pupils of any age. No teacher can help their pupils to access or demonstrate learning without considering their literacy needs: every teacher is a literacy teacher.\n\nYou will need to read the Research and Practice Summary before speaking to and/or arranging to observe a colleague to consider an aspect of literacy development. There are many aspects of literacy development that you could choose to focus on, reflected in the learning intentions for this session. Choose one (or more, if you are more confident) that you would like to develop your understanding of for today’s session, having looked back at the self-evaluation audit you completed at the start of this module. Reflect on your learning from this session ahead of your next mentor meeting and be prepared to discuss and identify possible next steps for your practice.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Every teacher is a teacher of literacy</h3>\n<strong>\n  As you read this summary, consider your own pupils in your school.\n</strong> You will also follow real-life examples from two other teachers.\nImogen teaches Year 3 in a primary school in Greater Manchester. Tom is a\nteacher for children with language and communication needs in a special school\nin north London. $CTA\n\nChildren who have good written and spoken literacy skills are able to engage with their school’s curriculum and experience success as a result. For these reasons, developing pupils’ literacy is perhaps the most important aspect of education for schools to focus on.\n\nThe development of early literacy is especially important. This involves the development of two capabilities: word reading and language comprehension. Using systematic, synthetic phonics is the most effective way of developing decoding, which supports word reading. A wide range of approaches, including high quality discussion, will develop pupils’ language capabilities.\n\nOnce pupils have mastered phonics and are able to accurately decode, the emphasis should shift towards developing reading fluency. Pupils at this stage in their development can be identified by listening to them read. They will be able to read accurately, but they will be slow and their reading will not sound like speech and may sound disjointed. Developing reading fluency is usually a priority for pupils in KS2 and for a smaller number of pupils in KS3. Developing reading fluency requires extensive practice, but teachers can support this by modelling fluent reading, providing feedback on fluency and providing opportunities for repeated reading with a focus on developing fluency.\n\nIn the past, it has been argued that teaching literacy skills is limited to English lessons. This is false. All subjects and teachers have the opportunity and responsibility to develop pupils’ literacy capabilities. This does not mean teaching English during other subjects. Rather, it involves the development of disciplinary literacy, which is the development of reading, writing and oral language skills specific to each discipline.\n\nTo improve your pupils’ literacy, you should:\n\n- explicitly teach the reading, writing and oral language skills specific to the discipline or phase you work in (this includes writing in different genres, reading for interpretation, speaking collaboratively)\n- deliberately plan the teaching of unfamiliar vocabulary (e.g. by playing word games, matching words with definitions, displaying key vocabulary on the wall)\n- regularly expose your pupils to vocabulary which is high-utility and high-frequency and give them repeated practice (e.g. by using keyword tablemats and by modelling the vocabulary in your expositions)\n- model for your pupils how they can plan, draft and edit different types of writing specific to your subject or phase (e.g. by ‘live-writing’ a model answer on the whiteboard or using a visualiser to ‘live-model’ the editing process)\n\n**Reading comprehension** is a complex process involving word reading and language understanding. Word reading involves decoding or breaking down parts of a word by phoneme and blending these together to read the whole word. Reading comprehension means being able to read a section or an entire piece of text and understand its meaning. To make sense of a text, the reader draws on background knowledge, vocabulary, grammatical understanding and their ability to make inferences about meaning based on these.\n\nTo help you to develop your pupils’ reading comprehension, you should:\n\n- teach the skills of predicting, questioning, clarifying and summarising text (e.g. through live modelling or by allotting different ‘reading for...’ roles in group reading)\n- ‘think out loud’ when reading to help pupils to internalise strategies to help when reading independently\n- support pupil engagement and reading for pleasure (e.g. by reading with the whole class high-quality texts that you or they have chosen)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>How Imogen teaches reading comprehension, Year 3</h3>\nImogen is working with a group of Year 3 pupils on reading comprehension, building\non strategies she has previously introduced. She has split the group into 4, each\nwith a defined role. Tahir is the questioner: he will generate comprehension questions\nfrom the page of text to ask to the rest of the group. Poppy is the summariser: she\nwill sum up each paragraph/page for the rest of the group précising the text. Sam\nis the clarifier: he will identify any vocabulary that needs to be defined. And Sarika\nis the predictor: her role is to predict the next action in the story. The pupils\nare all familiar with their roles, as this is a strategy that has been modelled for\nthem regularly and the roles are swapped around; Imogen's role is to listen and provide\ndirection if they struggle with any aspects. Today, Imogen is going to read the text\naloud as the pupils take their roles; in this way, she will model how a fluent reader\nuses volume, tone, expression and modulation when they read – recognising that spoken\nlanguage underpins the development of reading and writing.\n\nThis is likely to be effective because the pupils are familiar with this form of collaborative learning; Imogen has already spent time establishing and reinforcing routines, such as taking turns. The lesson develops pupils’ capabilities in questioning, summarising, clarifying and predicting – collectively known as reading comprehension strategies. By allowing her pupils to practise these 4 strategies that good readers use automatically as they read and understand texts, Imogen supports pupils’ ability to comprehend texts independently in the future. Because this is a habitual part of Imogen’s teaching, her pupils are now familiar with all of the roles, although they may still find some harder than others. Modelling fluent reading also supports pupils’ comprehension of the texts.\n$I\n\n**Oral language** skills (or classroom talk) refer to the use of vocabulary and the quality of discussion by pupils as well as teachers. Encouraging pupils to use specific vocabulary and terminology during discussion in class helps to normalise and embed new words and improve the development of deep understanding. It broadens pupils’ vocabularies and helps them to articulate high-level ideas. Spoken language underpins both reading and writing development. Because modelling and requiring high-quality pupil talk underpins the development of reading and writing, it positively affects academic attainment across the curriculum and children’s social and emotional development.\n\nTo help develop quality oral language, you should:\n\n- carefully consider how ground rules and pupil reflection can help build a supportive environment for talk (e.g. circle time is a good opportunity for developing such rules) -- a useful rule to consider is the expectation that pupils respond in full sentences and use subject-specific vocabulary for certain activities\n- also improve your pupils’ skills in listening (e.g. by framing discussion where each person must respond to the previous speaker before making their own point)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Teaching vocabulary in a special school, in Tom’s own words</h3>\n“Some of my pupils are at the earliest stages of learning to talk. It’s important\nfor them to have basic vocabulary to get their needs met, such as being able to ask\nfor ‘more’, or ‘help’, or ‘toilet’. At dinner time, when Charlie wants more food,\nhe may try to reach across the table and take some from another plate. I try to pre-empt\nthis and say, ‘Oh, Charlie wants more’, showing him the ‘more’ sign (Makaton). I\nhelp him make the sign with his hands and encourage him to say ’more’ before giving\nhim another spoonful.”\n\nFor all children, learning to use words and signs to communicate is an important part of schooling. Certain key words, like those Tom mentioned, are prioritised to help pupils convey their wants and needs to others and reduce the need for them to use other behaviours to get what they want.\n\nIt is important in any context that key words that relate to core concepts are reinforced in different situations with different members of staff so that children learn the meaning and power of these words and the importance of mastering them. For many children, using a visual symbol or sign alongside a spoken word will be beneficial in reinforcing meaning and aiding understanding.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on literacy, including the 2 case studies featuring Imogen and Tom.\n\n- Can you give examples from your teaching or where you have observed these aspects of literacy teaching? You can take a note of any you are unsure of to discuss later with your mentor.\n- For each of the key concepts, think of them in terms of your own practice. (You might call to mind a particular pupil or a teaching strategy you like to use or one you have seen another teacher use.)\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both sharpen and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which aren’t yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\nThink about one pupil or one small group of pupils that you teach. Think back over the last half term and consider the different ways in which you have supported their literacy. For example, you may have:\n\n- read aloud high-quality texts\n- insisted on them speaking in full sentences as a model for writing\n- used worked examples or scaffolds to help improve the quality of their writing\n- explicitly taught the specific curriculum vocabulary that you want them to use\n\nWere they efficient approaches in terms of the time and effort spent and their impact?\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\nRead through the examples outlined below of potential discussion or observation foci and consider which will be most beneficial for your development. You should bear in mind the ages and stages of development of your pupils as well as your own practice knowledge and skills at this point.\n\n#### 1. Discussion with a colleague\n\nIdentify a colleague to observe or talk to who will enable you to see and evaluate effective practice in this area. For example, this could be a literacy coordinator, an HLTA with special interest in literacy or someone in your own phase or department who has expertise in the area.\n\n#### 2. Observation or discussion\n\nChoose an aspect of literacy outlined below and an area of focus for discussion and/or observation to carry out with this colleague prior to your mentor meeting. If it saves time for you and your colleague, you could conduct the conversation by email.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Learning intentions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Possible foci for observation or discussion**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 3m. Demonstrating a clear understanding of systematic synthetic phonics, particularly if teaching early reading and spelling.                                                                                                                             | - What approach to teaching systematic synthetic phonics works best for you in your class? For example, teacher modelling of segmenting and blending orally and in writing. - How is systematic synthetic phonics used to support the teaching of spelling? For example, explicit use of phonics to support the teaching of spelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 3o.

For example, teaching vocabulary to specific groups of pupils prior to the lesson to support understanding for all. - How is key technical vocabulary taught and understood in context? For example, use of images to support comprehension (visuals on Interactive White Board or wall displays).                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 3p.

For example, modelling identifying key events (so far, we have read that…). - How does the teacher model asking questions of the text? For example, using question prompts to respond to the text (What do you like/ dislike about…? Why do you think…? What does this remind you of?)                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 3q.

For example, use of ground rules to support the creation of a positive climate for constructive dialogue (I like what X said about this, and I would add… I understand the point that Y made, but I think…). - To what extent do they use sentence stems to scaffold pupils’ oral responses? For example, use of key phrases to support pupils’ responses to talk partner questions (I agree with… because… I understand what you are saying, but have you considered…?). |\n| 3s.

Is editing time built into the writing process?

These link information related to a current activity to what pupils already know. As part of this, you examined how weak prior knowledge and misconceptions can have a negative effect on subsequent learning. You also looked at how you can take into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce.\n\nUsing techniques such as breaking complex material into smaller steps and reducing distractions, you saw how you can design lessons so that working memory is not overloaded, i.e. avoiding cognitive overload. This means that your pupils can focus their attention on what is relevant in the lesson. You discussed with your mentor how to identify misconceptions and sequence lesson content to provide a more secure base for future learning.\n\nIn this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of how memory works, focusing on consolidation processes in long-term memory in particular (2.5, 2.7). You will consider how new memories are formed (i.e. learning) and how these new memories integrate with existing knowledge (3.3). You will use an illustrative exercise to understand how learning strategies, such as retrieval practice, spacing and worked examples, can lead to more robust storage of new memories, making for easier retrieval (2.8, 2.9).\n\nYou should apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Consolidation, coding, retrieval and spaced practice</h3>\nDo you remember that two weeks ago you met Bob, who was learning about cells in his\nbiology lessons? After initially introducing cells and tackling problems linked to\nspecialised cells, Bob’s teacher waited a couple of weeks before returning to the\ntopic and giving Bob’s class a quick quiz on the topic.\n\n<strong>\n  Why did Bob’s teacher do this? As you read this Research and Practice Summary,\n  try to work out why.\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Consolidation** refers to the process of strengthening or stabilising new memories by transferring new learning from short- to long-term memory storage. When a memory is created (or ‘encoded’), many aspects of that memory (including the context within which the learning occurred) are also stored. Teachers can draw upon this ‘coding’ to help their pupils consolidate new learning as well as to recall learning stored in their long-term memory.\n\nTo help your pupils to consolidate their learning, you should:\n\n- give concrete worked examples and elaboration (e.g. explaining the new learning to someone else or showing models of ‘what good looks like’)\n- give plenty of opportunity for them to retrieve knowledge that they might have begun to forget (e.g. by spacing your initial teaching and revision and doing recall activities, such as low-stakes questioning)\n- establish ‘talk-partners’ within your class so that pupils establish the good habit of explaining things to one another\n\nEncoding is defined as the initial learning of information, storage refers to maintaining information over time and retrieval is the ability to access information when you need it. **Retrieval practice** is any strategy that requires pupils to reconstruct knowledge by ‘calling it to mind’ from their long-term memory, so that it can be recalled, manipulated or used in the present. Retrieval practice is highly effective in helping pupils consolidate material that has been recently learned and is more effective than simply re-reading material. The more easily pupils can retrieve information from their long-term memory, the smaller the load placed on their working memory. This, in turn, allows them to solve problems in front of them more easily or to solve more challenging problems.\n\nTo help your pupils to improve their recall, you should:\n\n- require them to retrieve information from memory (this can take the form of frequent, low-stakes testing or quizzing, or you could ask them to demonstrate a previously taught skill so you can see what they have retained)\n- try revisiting material from ‘last lesson, last week, last term’: lengthening the spacing increases the challenge and can strengthen recall, that is, spacing the practice\n\n**Spaced practice** is a learning strategy whereby areas of the curriculum are broken up into short sessions, which are repeated over a longer period of time. This can be contrasted with ‘blocking’, whereby learning material is visited in large blocks which are not repeated. Spaced practice provides pupils with the time to form connections between the ideas and concepts so that knowledge can be built upon and easily recalled later. By allowing a memory to be almost forgotten before it is next recalled, Ebbinghaus found the reactivation of the memory is more effortful, which strengthens neural pathways in the brain. When this process is repeated several times, the memory becomes stronger and much easier to remember.\n\nTo help with your pupils’ progress using spacing, you should:\n\n- discuss with a colleague how your curriculum is arranged and where the opportunities may be to introduce more spacing\n- make sure you enable your pupils to master foundational concepts first\n- combine with retrieval practice activities, such as low-stakes testing, to improve their recall\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Bob’s teacher do?</h3>\nSarah, who teaches Bob biology, carefully considered how she would teach Bob’s class\nabout the structure and function of cells. This is foundational knowledge that Bob\nand his peers need to have a secure understanding of to succeed in biology.\n\nSarah began with careful exposition and opportunities for pupils to initially learn about cells. During their next lesson, they took this further to consolidate their learning by tackling a series of questions. After this second lesson, Sarah checked to ensure that all pupils understood what she had taught them and was pleased that they had.\n\nHowever, Sarah knew that this would not be enough to consolidate this key knowledge into their long-term memory. Therefore, she planned opportunities to revisit this content using retrieval practice after appropriate intervals (spacing). Sarah did this using some quick questions at the start of her lessons linked to what pupils had learnt in the previous week. By adopting this approach, Sarah will support her pupils to learn about this foundational topic.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins\n\n#### 1. Practical exercise\n\nThink back to the cell biology scenario you considered in your first self-directed learning session of this module, where Bob had to learn about cell structures. Use that scenario as a model (see the Research and Practice Summary). For the subject, phase or setting you teach in, you will develop a similar exercise that you could use with one pupil or group of pupils to test the practices of retrieval and spaced practice.\n\n#### 2. Independent planning\n\nConsider your lesson plans for the forthcoming week and identify one context where you can try to use these learning strategies to aid consolidation of new information, as illustrated by the scenario with Bob.\n\n- identify the lesson or part of a lesson that you will focus on\n- write a simple plan for how you will make use of your learning about retrieval practice and spaced practice in this lesson or part of a lesson – and think about whether starting with a worked example might be helpful\n- annotate your plan to show why you have designed it in this way and discuss your thoughts with your mentor when you show them your plan\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your planning from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor, including raising any questions that have come to mind while completing this task.\n\n", nil, "ae4374c4-1274-420a-bbec-89a37405e90b"],

We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  Critical thinking, transfer and schemata in a values-led Year 6 PE lesson\n</h3>\nRachel passionately believes that PE is a great way to inculcate important life-skills\nand values in her pupils. She must also keep to the National Curriculum.\n\n<strong>\n  As you read this summary, think about how Rachel can use an invasion game\n  lesson to teach her pupils important values that they can think critically\n  about and apply elsewhere.\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nA school’s **curriculum** sets out its vision for the knowledge, values and skills that it wishes its pupils to learn. Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, there has been a National Curriculum in England and Wales which specifies the core of what should be covered within the state education sector. At GCSE and A level, the National Curriculum also forms the basis for the specifications written by examination boards. Contemporary curriculum guidance makes clear that schools are expected to go beyond the core curriculum. In particular, schools have a responsibility to identify the specific knowledge, skills and values that will benefit their pupils. At all stages of education, therefore, teachers and school leaders determine the details of what is taught and how this content is sequenced. In order to teach a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, teachers need a sound knowledge of the essential concepts, skills and principles of the subject. It is therefore essential that teachers develop and maintain a high level of subject knowledge through initial and continuing professional development.\n\n**Subject knowledge** encompasses what a teacher knows about the nature of a subject, the appropriate pedagogies to teach that subject and an expert awareness of how that subject appears in the curriculum (i.e. what needs to be taught). A teacher will continue therefore to expand their subject knowledge throughout their career. It is essential to effective teaching, for motivating and inspiring pupils, and for helping them to succeed academically.\n\nYou should aim to improve your subject knowledge by:\n\n- engaging in high-quality, subject-specific professional development (e.g. by doing development work, such as planning and moderation with colleagues in school and in wider networks)\n- participating in wider networks of fellow professionals, such as the Chartered College of Teaching\n- building a repertoire of resources, illustrations and explanations by working with experienced colleagues – these colleagues may be in your school or members of networks (including online networks) which generate, share and critique such resources\n\nOne of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ **prior knowledge** within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load.\n\nTo help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils, you should:\n\n- take account of it when planning how much new information to introduce (e.g. by conducting quick tests that give you instant feedback)\n- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (e.g. by pre-teaching concepts or by using classroom display to reinforce foundational ideas that are prone to misconception)\n- give them regular purposeful practice (by setting aside time in each lesson) so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory\n\n### How should Rachel take account of her pupils’ prior knowledge?\n\nA mental model or **schema** (plural **schemata**) is a pattern or network of thoughts, beliefs, knowledge and understanding that organise categories of information and the relationships between them. Schema can be simple (e.g. cars are a kind of vehicle) or complex (e.g. to drive a car, you need to start the ignition, apply the clutch, put it in gear, check the mirrors, and so on).\n\nBy encouraging pupils to think about how concepts relate to one another, teachers can help them build increasingly complex and robust schemata. Metaphorically, schemata can be thought of as systems of hooks or shelves onto which pupils can hang, place or incorporate new knowledge, skills, and beliefs.\n\nTo help your pupils develop their schemata and build increasingly complex mental models, you can:\n\n- revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples\n- draw explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject (e.g. by asking pupils to arrange ideas into categories - ‘Put together all the words that are about weather’, ‘Arrange the images by the places you would expect to find them’)\n- carefully sequence teaching to facilitate the process of organising knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (e.g. in primary maths, you might organise a sequence of lessons where you introduce progressively less familiar quadrilaterals, always pointing out their common features)\n- when you want to get your pupils to think about how they learn (metacognition), adopt a simple approach and repeat it often (e.g. use an acronym to help your pupils recall the steps)\n\n**Critical thinking** describes the ability to obtain and analyse information about a given topic in an organised and rational manner in order to understand the connections between concepts, facts and ideas and to arrive at judgments or conclusions.\n\nIn order for critical thinking to take place, pupils must first have a secure knowledge of the concepts they are being asked to think about. It is difficult to think critically about a topic you know little about. However, there are also general aspects to critical thinking – aspects that are highly transferable across subjects. These include constructing and deconstructing arguments, questioning, applying logic and reasoning, identifying and recognising logical fallacies, analysis, interpretation, inference, explanation, self-regulation, open-mindedness and problem-solving.\n\nTo help your pupils think critically, you should:\n\n- ensure they have a secure understanding of the subject area knowledge you want them to think critically about\n- invite them to think critically by sharing their reasoning and challenging the reasoning of others (e.g. by asking ‘What is your main reason for agreeing with Bilal?’, ‘Why might Leon have arrived at a different judgement?’)\n\n### Why might Rachel want her pupils to do some critical thinking in her lesson?\n\nThe question of **transfer** is also an important one in education: to what extent are knowledge and skills transferable from one subject to another? To what extent can pupils transfer their learning in one context (e.g. drawing graphs in maths) to another (e.g. drawing graphs in science)? To what extent are pupils able to apply the knowledge and skills they learn in school to their lives beyond the school gates? Research suggests that to a significant degree, knowledge and skills are context-dependent, that is, they tend to remain rooted in the contexts in which they were learned. This does not mean that transfer is not possible, but it does not tend to occur automatically, or naturally. It is therefore important that teachers support pupils in transferring knowledge and skills from one domain to another and provide them with opportunities to practise transfer themselves.\n\nTo help you to support pupils to transfer their knowledge, you should:\n\n- frequently ask the question ‘Where else do you use these ideas?’ (e.g. while teaching graphs in maths, you might ask them how they would apply the same knowledge to geography or science)\n- model the connections yourself (e.g. by saying how you use the knowledge or ideas in your own life)\n- draw comparisons between the subjects your pupils learn, whether you teach them across subjects or the teaching is shared by colleagues (e.g. a history teacher could refer to the war poetry their class had studied in English)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  Transfer: Helen, a teacher in a Pupil Referral Unit, explains her thinking\n</h3>\n“Many of the PRU pupils initially struggle to see the point in learning.  In order\nto get them to see their PRU experience as a whole, we look for cross-curricular\nlinks, and I aim to include transferrable skills where possible in my lessons. So,\nwhen I am teaching about climates, I will get pupils to draw climate graphs. Before\ndoing this, we will look at different types of graphs, and I will ask pupils what\nthey are and how they could be used. I will also ask them when they last drew one\nin order to get them to see that they are transferring skills from other subjects\nand that skills learned in lessons should not be seen as stand-alone. I know this\nworks when pupils moan that they have already done this in maths or science or they\ncomplete the graph element independently with little help.”\n\n<strong>How might this apply equally to Rachel?</strong>\n$CTA\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Rachel do?</h3>\nHere is a recreation of Rachel’s lesson plan, with a commentary about why it worked\nwell.\n\n<strong>Aim</strong>: To teach the 3Cs (co-operation, communication,\ncollaboration) through an uneven-sided invasion game.\n\n<strong>Initial instruction</strong>: ‘Cooperation, communication and\ncollaboration are really important in life and in sport. Working in a team, make\na plan to help you achieve success in a game of ‘Pass/Head/Kick’. In your team,\ndiscuss and make a list of what helps you to achieve success in a team game.’\n\n<strong>Explanation of rules</strong>: Teams are 4 attackers ‘v’ 2 defenders.\nAttack: Teams of 4 have to move the ball from one end of the court to the other.\nThey can either throw, head or kick the ball in any combination, but they must\nthrow, kick and head at least once before scoring. They cannot use two of the\nsame technique one after the other. Defence: Teams of 2 have to try to intercept\nthe ball to prevent the attackers from getting the ball to the opposite end of\nthe court.\n\n<strong>Warm-up</strong>: Practise throwing, catching and heading the ball\nbetween pairs.\n\n<strong>Play the game</strong>: Rachel monitors the play and keeps a record of\nhow her pupils show the 3Cs.\n\n<strong>Plenary</strong>: Rachel stops the lesson for the ‘EAR’ part of the\nlesson. Rachel often uses EAR so the pupils have a framework for their thinking.\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">EVALUATE:</td>\n      <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n        How successful has your strategy been?

How well did you practise the 3Cs? What could\n        your team have done better? What do you think are the important\n        ingredients to making a team a success? What have you learned about the\n        3Cs that would help you be more successful in other lessons or\n        situations?\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\nThis lesson is consistent with core knowledge requirements of the National\nCurriculum, where pupils are required to communicate, collaborate and compete\nwith each other and evaluate and recognise their own success. They develop\nphysical competence in throwing, catching, kicking, controlling and heading the\nball. Rachel believes in the 3Cs’ attribute and in the values of fairness and\nrespect, which are built into team games like this. The warm-up enabled Rachel\nto check the prior learning of her pupils in these physical skills. She could\ngive feedback on their 3Cs as she monitored them at play. This lesson enabled\npupils to develop a range of core knowledge and skills relating to their\nphysical, cognitive, social and affective development. These are all skills that\nare important and have application across the wider curriculum and life beyond\nschool. Her questioning in EAR drew attention to that transfer. As the EAR phase\nunfolded, it also allowed the pupils to think critically about successful team\nstrategies. By using EAR, Rachel helps her pupils to develop increasingly\ncomplex schemata for adding new ideas to existing knowledge. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic, including the examples from Helen and Rachel. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n#### Reflect\n\nThink about your own values: Why did you want to be a teacher? What difference to society are you hoping to make by being a teacher? Now think how these values might influence the way you transform the national and school curricula in your classroom. Remember how Rachel taught the 3Cs values in her PE lesson.\n\n- write one sentence outlining your values for education: what is education for?\n- add below your sentence 3 examples of how you enact your values in your classroom\n- below that add 3 more examples of wider activities in your school which you would say are consistent with your own values\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\nAs mentioned in the Early Career Framework, secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively (3.2). There is therefore a need for teachers to maintain and extend their subject and curriculum knowledge throughout their careers. Over this week and next, we suggest practical activities which aim at framing this knowledge and relating it to what you have already seen around misconceptions and progression.\n\n#### **1.** Independent planning\n\nNow, bring together your appreciation of the values inherent in education with the way that you might organize learning. Do this through planning your approach to a topic that you will be teaching soon, ideally a topic that you are less comfortable with, so that you can develop your own understanding further. You can focus on a sequence of lessons, an individual lesson or even one part of a lesson, as best suits your context. Consider the following questions as you do so:\n\n1. what core knowledge and skills should be conveyed within this topic?\n2. what opportunities are there to support your educational values in this topic?\n3. draw on your understanding of your pupils’ prior knowledge to sequence the content within the lesson(s) (and any home learning)\n4. you do not need to go as far as developing your planning in detail, but at this point, you may have ideas for engaging activities which will support pupil learning, so jot these down\n\n#### **2**. Independent planning\n\nWith this outline of a teaching sequence in place, now add to your sequence at least one opportunity for pupils to use their learning to think critically. This could be a discussion about a real-world problem, in which they outline their reasoning, or it could be a creative process involving their knowledge. As an extension activity for your pupils, you could ask them to identify how that might apply – transfer – their learning from this to other contexts.\n\nTo support your planning, Rachel’s lesson plan might give you a model to follow.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBe ready to share your planning notes and your other learning from this session with your mentor in your next meeting with them. You may find it helpful to make a few notes on your planning explaining why you have included particular aspects and the reasoning behind how they are sequenced.\n\nIn activity 1(c), you may have identified some subject content that you are not yet fully confident in teaching. Make a note of the topics you identified and set yourself a target date by which you will complete some further study in relation to these topics.\n\n", nil, "f5e81cea-c189-4e63-9cc2-d57e39e46dcd"],

This session will also consider the importance of repeated practice to ensure that you maximise opportunities for pupils to succeed, through the appropriate level of guidance and support.\n\nYou can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  Modelling and Scaffolding for structured writing in a Pupil Referral Unit\n</h3>\nHelen wants her small group of Key Stage 3 pupils to write some paragraphs on ‘What\ndoes it mean to be British?’ She knows that her pupils have a range of learning needs,\nthey are largely disinclined to work independently and they are prone to give up\nbefore a task is finished.\n\n<strong>\n  How might Helen scaffold her pupils’ learning, while also building their\n  independence, so that they are able to write their paragraphs on British\n  Values?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Modelling** is an instructional strategy in which the teacher demonstrates a new concept or approach to learning, and pupils learn by observing. It describes the process of learning or acquiring new information, skills, or behaviour through observation, rather than through direct experience or trial-and-error efforts. Modelling involves using a new method or concept as part of the instruction process, so that pupils can hear or see what you intend them to do. It helps them to understand more clearly how to solve a problem or construct a sentence, for example, by seeing it being done. It also enables them to practise more effectively, and therefore encode and consolidate the new learning in the long-term memory. Examples of modelling include written, visual or video guides, scaffolding, and worked examples.\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  For Helen, what would be useful for her to model for her pupils, and when\n  should she do it?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Worked examples** involve pupils studying the solved ‘problem’, rather than solving the problem themselves. They are highly effective because they reduce cognitive load, allowing pupils to focus on one step of a problem at a time without ‘getting lost’ in the problem. The aim is for the pupils to gain as close an understanding as possible of what their teacher sees as a high-quality model.\n\nTo help you use worked examples to aid your pupils’ progress, you should:\n\n- provide your pupils with a question or problem, alongside a detailed explanation of the solution (e.g. showing them one you made earlier, or what a good one looks like)\n- guide them through the process of following the worked example (e.g. highlighting the criteria that made it successful, and how you achieved them)\n- this provides the pupils with a guide for how to solve other, similar problems ensure that the range of tasks available to pupils with lower and higher prior attainment are appropriately pitched, to ensure that all pupils are able to push themselves to meet their ‘challenge target’ in each lesson\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Would you recommend that Helen use a worked example for her class? Why? Why\n  not?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Scaffolding** refers to a variety of instructional techniques used to move pupils progressively toward stronger understanding and, ultimately, toward greater independence in their learning. It describes a system of prompts or supports that pupils can use at the beginning of a learning cycle, which are gradually withdrawn as they become more confident.\n\nTo help your pupils make better progress through scaffolding, you should:\n\n- avoid overwhelming their working memory (e.g. by breaking new content down and reframing questions)\n- gradually reduce the amount of scaffolding that is given, as they become more confident*\n- give opportunities to repeat (rehearse), as this will build confidence and independence. (You can allow them to practise with and without the scaffolds)\n\n*A model of how to withdraw prompts and support gradually is shown here:\n\n**Checking understanding and adapting teaching**\n\n$Figure\n$Alt A two-way arrow which shows that we go back and forth through exposition, shared, guided and independent practice in order to check our understanding and adapt our teaching. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ucl/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/08/arrow-two-way.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\n| Exposition                                           | Shared practice                                               | Guided practice                                            | Independent practice         |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Teacher models, explains, demonstrates, thinks aloud | Explicit teaching with teacher and pupils practising together | Pupils practise with guidance and support from the teacher | Pupils practise on their own |\n\n**Increasing pupil responsibility**\n\n$Figure\n$Alt An arrow pointing to the right which shows that through the process of exposition, shared, guided and independent practice there will be an increase in student responsibility. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/ucl/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/08/arrow-forward.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption\n$EndFigure\n\nIt is useful to recognise that, although many language skills are generic, they may also be specific to individual subjects. This becomes increasingly important as pupils get older and experience a wider set of **subject-specific literacy** demands, the academic language and conventions of different subjects. For example, pupils in one subject (say, science) may read a text purely for information, whereas in history or English they might need to be aware of the author’s interpretation.\n\nTo help your pupils understand the discipline-specific aspects of literacy in your subject, you should:\n\n- ask yourself what is unique about your discipline, in terms of reading, writing, speaking or listening – for example, does ‘writing a report’ mean the same thing to you as it does to a teacher of another discipline?\n- with colleagues, compile lists of words or phrases which are used atypically in your discipline, or which are foundational to your discipline (good quality textbooks are good places to look)\n\nExtensive **practice** is also important, and gradually reducing the amount of support and scaffolding that is given will enable pupils to become more confident and independent. It can also allow pupils to master and build up individual aspects of learning without having to do everything at once.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Helen do? In her own words:</h3>\n\"I use scaffolding techniques a lot, especially if I want a considered piece of writing\ncompleted. With one group, I was looking at British Values: ‘What does it mean to\nbe British?’ My aim was to achieve a few paragraphs on this. My group was not particularly\nkeen on writing. I needed them to build up their ideas slowly before elaborating,\notherwise it was quite possible I would get a refusal by some to do the work. We\nstarted off with a ‘hook’, a muddled cartoon picture showing lots of ‘British’ things.\nPupils had to find and name as many as they could – my pupils love a bit of challenge\nand competition, so this type of activity often goes down well. Once completed, the\npupils were given blank cards to identify any possible groupings and write them down\n(e.g. food), then adding actual examples. All the time this was going on, my aim\nwas to question the pupils about their understanding of the topics we were looking\nat. Once the pupils had the information they had obtained, I revealed to them that\nI am Irish. I showed them (in different colours) one sentence I had already written\nabout ‘What it means to be Irish’, one sentence about how I could personally relate\nto this topic, and one sentence about what it showed about Ireland. All my pupils\nwere ready then to write their own sentences. I could see them looking at the board\nat my sentences, trying to work out what they would need to change. Some pupils stopped\nthere, but one pupil who had been vocal in discussion added her own introduction\nand (with my prompting) a conclusion paragraph. This activity reflected a growing\nunderstanding of the topic, plus a move towards more independent learning by one\npupil.\"\n\nHelen was aware that, before her pupils could write, they would need help with generating ideas to write about. This is where she used the muddled cartoon and the blank cards, which helped her pupils to gather ideas into categories – which would then become paragraphs. This was her main scaffolding technique: it suggested the structure that her pupils should follow, but allowed them freedom to select independently. She then modelled with a worked example, one which was different – but sufficiently similar – to the final product she wanted from the class. One of her pupils was able to move to the next stage without any explicit modelling.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n#### Self-assessment\n\nThink back to the last two weeks of your teaching – if it helps, think about one curriculum area, or one class – and focus on where you have used explicit modelling and scaffolding. Doing the following quick self-assessment will help establish your priorities for the independent planning exercise which comes after.\n\n| Activity*           | **😊😑😕** | Examples and notes |\n| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |\n| Exposition           |            |                    |\n| Shared practice      |            |                    |\n| Guided practice      |            |                    |\n| Independent practice |            |                    |\n\n(*Refer back to the Research and Practice Summary above)\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\n#### 1. Independent Planning\n\nNow look ahead to an area of your curriculum that you will be covering soon, where you know it would be helpful for pupils to have a degree of scaffolding and modelling.\n\nIf, in your self-assessment above, you said you were unhappy with ‘exposition’, you might choose to focus now on modelling. Worked examples are very useful when sharing practice. As your pupils move from guided to independent practice, you might introduce and then withdraw scaffolds.\n\nTo support you with independent planning:\n\n- look again at the example from Helen in the Pupil Referral Unit\n- remember to build in opportunities for your pupils to practise independently (Do you need them to work in pairs, larger groups or alone? How much time will you allow in your lesson?)\n- how will you judge when your pupils are ready to have any scaffolds removed? (e.g. Will you assess their readiness by selected questioning or circulating the room? Sometimes it is a good idea to allow pupils to choose to work with or without a scaffold)\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your planning notes from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor and work with them to review and refine your planning.\n\n", nil, "3f6dc15a-be4a-4056-b5f2-ea2d74ce7b6c"],

The key messages from that session were to understand why modelling helps pupils to understand ideas and why scaffolds and worked examples (and their gradual removal) are central to building pupils’ confidence and expertise.\n\nIn this self-directed study session, you will extend your knowledge of how to introduce new material in steps, making links to pupils’ prior knowledge, with an emphasis on **expositions** (explanations). This session will also focus on an essential teaching tool, **questioning**, and how it can be used for many purposes in order to secure knowledge and understanding.\n\nYou can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Exposition and questioning – ‘How books work’ in Early Years</h3>\nAs an Early Years teacher, Jo needs to teach her pupils how written language works.\nThis includes how books work. There is a lot of knowledge pupils need to acquire\nin this first step towards reading. For example, they need to know that: books are\nheld in a particular way; print has meaning and can be used for different purposes;\nthere is a relationship between print and speech and there is a difference between\nletters and words.\n\nJo knows she cannot teach all of the concepts at once to her young pupils. <strong>What would you recommend she do?</strong>\n$CTA\n\nYou have seen that the gradual release of responsibility model can bring together key ideas about teaching and learning. This research and practice summary explores two parts of this model: exposition, whereby teachers introduce new ideas; and checking understanding through questioning, which can help teachers decide how to move between different stages in the model.\n\n**Exposition** refers to the process of explaining concepts, ideas and information with great clarity. It requires the teacher to have sound knowledge of the curriculum area, and involves ensuring that pupils are able to understand new information in the context of their prior knowledge and understanding. Exposition is about more than simply telling pupils information. It also involves providing examples to illustrate and illuminate the material to be learned. Examples can include visual and conceptual models, application of rules, and contextual information. Good exposition may also involve modelling. Exposition does not require pupils to make discoveries themselves: by moving from the general to the specific, it allows pupils to understand increasingly detailed explanations of the material to be learned, and link those explanations to information presented previously as part of a general overview.\n\nTo help your pupils learn through more effective exposition you should:\n\n- be prepared to break down your expositions further for those pupils who may need it (e.g. by ‘chunking’ bits of knowledge across several lessons)\n- plan what you are going to say and how you are going to model to your pupils (e.g. by scripting it in your lesson plan)\n- think about the visuals and examples you can use that will help your pupils connect this new learning with that they already know (e.g. by referring to characters they have met in favourite stories)\n- allow time also for pupils to practise: don’t simply rely upon exposition\n\n$CTA\nJo already knows that she needs to break down the concepts related to how books work. <strong>How else might she benefit from the research on exposition?</strong>\n$CTA\n\nWhen introducing abstract ideas, it is important often to use **concrete representations**. These might take the form of analogies, metaphors, examples and non-examples. Teachers often over-estimate their pupils’ grasp of the abstract, and then overlook the misconceptions that can arise. Numbers are abstract, as can be such concepts as the ‘Church’ (i.e. the institution), verbs, the past or ‘science’.\n\nTo help you with your expositions of abstract ideas, you should:\n\n- use manipulables (e.g. blocks and shapes)\n- construct number lines and timelines\n- use play and drama to ‘act out’ words and concepts\n- when using graphic representation, make sure you are not introducing a new misconception (e.g. an image of a church building may not help pupils appreciate the idea of the Church as an institution)\n\nRepeat these approaches often: they are a form of scaffold, which can be gradually removed when you assess that your pupils are ready.\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  What ‘concrete’ ways might Jo choose to represent the concepts of how books\n  and written language work?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nTo ensure that learning is effective and efficient it is critical to regularly check pupils’ understanding and use this information to adapt teaching. This can be done in many different ways, but questioning is a key tool. **Questioning** is the key method by which teachers find out what pupils already know, identify gaps in knowledge and understanding and scaffold the development of their understanding to enable them to close the gap between what they currently know and the learning goals. Questions serve a number of essential purposes for teachers. For example, they:\n\n- provide the teacher with immediate feedback on pupils’ understanding, which can then be used to modify the teaching\n- prompt pupils to inspect their existing knowledge – articulating and retrieving helps clarify and consolidate learning, and improves the likelihood that it will be retained\n- focus pupils on the key components of the learning sequence\n- enable teachers and pupils to see progress over time\n- model for pupils how experienced learners seek meaning, moving them towards greater independence\n\nTo help you use questioning to check your pupils’ prior learning and to assess their understanding, you could:\n\n- use multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions during lessons (e.g. a good source of well-constructed multiple-choice questions can be past examination papers, if these are available in your phase and specialism)\n- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding (e.g. ‘tell me how you reached that answer’, ‘what tells you that this is the correct answer?’)\n- use ‘hands-down’ questioning – when you pose a question to the whole class, give them thinking time, then you select the pupils to speak\n- combine ‘hands-down’ with ‘think-pair-share', where everyone thinks alone, then discusses with a partner, before the teacher selects the pupils to answer\n- allow thinking time – often a little longer than feels naturally comfortable\n\nRecording key questions in schemes of work also encourages teachers to identify what they want pupils to know and understand, to communicate this to pupils (sharing learning goals) and to find ways of checking that these have been achieved in lessons. This in turn enables teachers to tailor their teaching to what pupils need to know next.\n\n$I\nJo will certainly be asking lots of questions, to check her pupils’ understanding and to help her break down the problems for them.\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Jo do?</h3>\nJo decided to ‘chunk’ the knowledge and understanding of how written language in\nbooks works. She also chose to give the pupils repeated exposure to the steps, so\nthat the knowledge would stick. To start, she selected just one focus: how to hold\na book. She then went through these steps:\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    Check what the pupils already know about holding a book. She observed her\n    pupils with books, holding them, leafing through them, pretending to read\n    them. She noted those pupils who frequently handled the books incorrectly\n    and carried out the next steps with them.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ‘I do it’. Modelling: picking up the book and talking through how the book\n    should be held. She thought ‘out loud’: I’m thinking about which way up this\n    book goes. I need to hold it like this so that I can open the pages like\n    this. The pages I open are always on this side.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ‘We do it together’. Checking their understanding by simple true/false\n    questioning: holding the book up the wrong way, do they notice? Am I holding\n    the book the right way? To stop them merely guessing, she did ‘think, pair,\n    share’ with them so all had to think about their answers.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ‘You do it with/without my support’. The pupils now think they know how to\n    hold a book, but can they remember how the next time she asks them? She\n    checked how they could apply their knowledge from before, using the same\n    book. Do you remember the book we looked at yesterday? Can you pick the book\n    up and show me how to hold it so we can look at it together?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ‘You do it with/without my support’ in a new context. She checked their\n    application with different types of books: Can you hold the Big Book so we\n    can read it together? Let’s look at this pop-up book together. It’s a bit\n    different from other books we’ve seen, can you see how to hold it?\n  </li>\n</ol>\nThis approach worked well for Jo. It could work equally well in a range of other\nsettings, for almost any new set of material. The most important elements were to\nassess her pupils’ prior knowledge (by observing them handling books informally)\nand to break the new learning into small steps (both in recognising the different\nelements to ‘how books work’, and in chunking down one element into yet smaller steps).\nThe only concrete representation she needed was the book itself, but it is good practice\nalways to ‘make real’ what your pupils might find abstract. All the while, at each\nstage she checked understanding with simple questioning. Finally, she gradually released\nresponsibility to her pupils, moving through stages of ‘I do it’ to ‘You do it’.\nThis was how they practised and applied their new knowledge, and gained accuracy\nand confidence. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n**Reflection**\n\nUse these prompts to help you to reflect on your classroom practice over the past few weeks.\n\n- When you introduced new material, did you do it in small steps? How did that go?\n- How did you explain abstract ideas? Did you use concrete examples? How did that go?\n- Did you use different questioning approaches to gauge your pupils’ understanding? How did that go?\n- What would you keep doing, or do more of? What might you do less of, or stop doing?\n\nYou could record your most important reflections in your Learning Log.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\nYou have a choice of activities now. The reflection exercise you just did will help you choose, as will your self-audit from the start of this module.\n\n**_Either:_**\n\n#### 1. Independent planning\n\nUse your learning from this session to plan a lesson that you will shortly be teaching. You may choose to focus on a specific part of the lesson, if this best suits your context. Annotate your plan to show how you have drawn on your learning from this self-study session. It is best if you produce a lesson plan where you will be introducing new material to the pupils. Consider as much of the following as you can in your planning:\n\n- how you plan to break down the new knowledge and concepts into small steps so that you do not overload pupils’ working memory\n- how to script your expositions to include examples, analogies or metaphors\n- how you could include both a verbal explanation and graphical or concrete representation of the same concept\n- how you will explicitly link the new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned\n- how you will plan your questions for specific points of the lesson to (a) check pupils’ prior knowledge, (b) assess their understanding, and (c) assist them to break down problems\n- the types of questions used to extend and challenge pupils (modelling and developing pupils’ vocabulary)\n- the wait time between question and response in order to elicit more developed responses\n\n**_Or:_**\n\n#### 2. Observe a colleague\n\nAsk permission to observe part of a colleague’s lesson, where they will be introducing new material to the pupils. Be sure to tell them what the focus of your observation is, so that you can be there at the right time. You should aim to observe a colleague who is known to be good at introducing new material. But remember, you are not there to judge them.\n\nIt is a good idea to use a focused observation grid, like this:\n\n|                     |                    |                   |\n| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |\n| Start of the lesson | Body of the lesson | End of the lesson |\n| Whole class         | Small groups       | Individual pupils |\n\nDuring different parts of the lesson, and to different groupings of pupils, how does the teacher do any of the following:\n\n- How does the teacher breakdown content into small steps?\n- Are steps taken to reduce load on working memory? If so, what steps did they take?\n- How do they explicitly link the new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned?\n- Does the teacher include both a verbal explanation and graphical representation to explain the same concept?\n- Do their expositions include examples, analogies or metaphors?\n- How is questioning used to assess pupil understanding throughout?\n- Does the teacher use different types of questions to extend and challenge pupils?

In that session, you explored practical examples of using questioning for different purposes, in order for pupils to secure knowledge and understanding (for example, with ‘stem questions’ as a supportive tool). Finally, you were given guidance in order to consider expositions and questioning when introducing new material to pupils.\n\nIn this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of how to transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning through modelling the effective use of metacognitive strategies to enable pupils to self-regulate their learning. You will also reflect on the role that setting homework plays in the transformation of pupils’ capabilities and knowledge about learning.\n\nYou can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Modelling metacognitive strategies – Year 1 Science</h3>\nChristine is teaching science to her Year 1 class. She wants them to be able to name\na variety of common animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals,\nand to identify the main differences between fish and amphibians. Earlier in the\nlesson she reminded them of work from Reception year on the differences between plants\nand animals, and she introduced the core vocabulary (fish, bird, amphibian, mammal,\nreptile) alongside example images of each type of animal.\n\n<strong>\n  How could she use metacognition and self-regulation strategies here to help\n  her pupils?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nYou have previously seen how the gradual release of responsibility model can bring together some key ideas about teaching and learning. The stages in the model could be described in various ways. However, the central idea is that effective teaching begins with exposition and modelling, and provides extensive practice with fading of support with the end goal of achieving independence. Throughout the process, teachers check pupils’ understanding to identify the best next steps in learning and dynamically move pupils between the stages.\n\n**Metacognition** is often described simply as ‘thinking about thinking’. We learn to control our thinking by monitoring what we know about people (self and others), tasks and strategies. Metacognitive knowledge grows through experience, by setting goals and by selecting strategies to achieve those goals. All of these components interact with one another, and through such interactions we develop metacognitive skills and further our metacognitive knowledge. In practical terms, a useful rule of thumb is to think of metacognition as focusing on the ‘how’ of learning.\n\nTo help you to teach your pupils metacognitive strategies, you could:\n\n- ‘think aloud’: show your pupils what you are thinking when you are carrying out a complex task (e.g. ‘When I come to write this conclusion, I need to remember to...’)\n- build opportunities in your lessons for your pupils to plan out their time, and for them to monitor (perhaps with a partner) their progress through a task\n- get your pupils to evaluate their learning (e.g. pupils award themselves _WWW_ and _EBI_ )\n- when instructing them in a new task, remind your pupils how they will be thinking and learning in a similar way to one they have experienced before\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Given the age of Christine’s pupils, and what she wants them to learn, which\n  of these strategies might work best for her? Which might work best for your\n  own context?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Self-regulated learning**, an associated concept, is about how pupils monitor their learning. Self-regulated learners are aware of their strengths and limitations, they set learning goals for themselves, they monitor their behaviour in terms of their goals and self-reflect on their increasing effectiveness. This enhances their self-satisfaction and motivation to continue to improve.\n\nTo help you to teach your pupils to self-regulate in their learning, you could:\n\n- set yourself, or others, as an example (e.g. ‘I self-regulate my learning by making a promise to myself to read about my subject for two hours every Sunday, and giving myself a treat when I do’)\n- make self-evaluation and target-setting a frequent feature of learning (e.g. by asking your pupils to use ‘I can’ and ‘I will’ statements after they have finished a topic)\n- in verbal feedback, invite your pupils to express themselves in terms of their strengths, their development areas and their next steps\n- closely monitor not just the quality of their homework, but how they do it (e.g. the total time they spend on it, the breaks they build in for themselves, how they chunk it, if they draft and re-draft. You could sample this with just a small number of your pupils)\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>Will any of these strategies be useful for Christine?</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Modelling** is an instructional strategy in which the teacher demonstrates a new concept or approach to learning and pupils learn by observing. It describes the process of learning or acquiring new information, skills, or behaviour through observation, rather than through direct experience or trial-and-error efforts. Modelling involves using a new method or concept as part of the instruction process, so that pupils can hear or see what you intend them to do. It helps them to understand more clearly how to solve a problem or construct a sentence, for example, by seeing it being done. It also enables them to practise more effectively, and therefore encode and consolidate the new learning in the long-term memory. Examples of modelling include written, visual or video guides, scaffolding, and worked examples.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What Christine did – a script of her lesson</h3>\n‘I want to see if I can remember the names of the different animal groups. I have\na cool way of remembering them. It’s linked to a pet shop I go to called FARM B.\n(show image of pet shop sign “FARM B”). Inside, all of the different animals are\ngrouped together. In the F section are the fish. In the A section are the amphibians.\nIn the R section, hmm let me think which of our animal groups begins with ‘r’? (Refer\nback to images of different animals with names.) Oh yes, the reptiles. Then onto\nthe M section. That’s the mammals. Then finally we have the B section. What were\nthey again? Birds. Let me check if I have them all, F - fish, A - amphibians, R -\nreptiles, M - mammals, B - birds. FARM B - what an easy way to remember the different\ntypes of animals!’\n\nShe then explored features of fish and amphibians through looking at both groups, sharing what the pupils know about each. She asked questions e.g. How do I breathe? How do I move? Where do I live?\n\n‘How can I tell a fish from an amphibian?\n\nNow I know the names “fish” and “amphibian”, I need to remember how to tell them apart. I know that the main difference is that amphibians can breathe in and out of water. How can I remember that difference? Let’s look at the word: <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Amphib</strong> <strong>I</strong>n <strong>an</strong>d out</span>\n\nThat’s a great way of remembering that amphibians can breathe in and out of water! I love it when the names of animals tell us about their special features!’\n\nChristine then showed the class a picture of an unnamed animal, with ‘clues’.\n\n‘So, let me see if this works for animal x. The clue says “I can breathe out of water.” Hmm, so can amphibians, so does this mean it is definitely an amphibian? No, because there are other groups of animals that can breathe out of water, like birds and mammals, so I must look at its other features.\n\nClue 2: “I can also breathe in water.” Right, I’m happy to say it must be an amphibian now because only amphibians can breathe in and out of water.’\n\nChristine narrated her thought processes by thinking out loud. This would model metacognition linked to subject knowledge for her pupils. Her use of mnemonics (FARM B, Amphib In and out) helped make the learning memorable. She alerted her pupils to the potential pitfall (of classing all animals that breathe out of water amphibians). To check their learning had ‘stuck’ she set the class homework to use the mnemonic to help them work out the features of another group of animals. She then used this homework task to revisit the learning and build upon their knowledge.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n**Self-assessment**\n\nReflect on your classroom practice since the start of the year and complete this checklist: (look back at the Research and Practice Summary for examples)\n\n| I do this                                    | Never/rarely | Sometimes | Often |\n| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----- |\n| ‘Think aloud’                                |              |           |       |\n| Time for pupils to monitor progress          |              |           |       |\n| Peer- and self-evaluation                    |              |           |       |\n| Thinking in similar ways for different tasks |              |           |       |\n| Set myself as an example of a learner        |              |           |       |\n| Self-target setting                          |              |           |       |\n| Monitor how they do homework                 |              |           |       |\n\nBe ready to share this checklist with your mentor and to talk about one or two examples of how you have supported metacognition and self-regulated learning.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\nUse your self-audit from the start of this module and the checklist you just completed when deciding on which of the following options to select.\n\n#### 1. Scripting\n\nIdentify parts of a forthcoming lesson where explicit modelling is required. Develop a script for sharing your implicit thought processes in a way that makes your thoughts clear and explicit to the pupils. Have you made any common assumptions around concepts that may need to be explicitly highlighted to pupils?\n\nHave a look again at Christine’s Year 1 science lesson for an example of a script.\n\n#### 2. Practical activity\n\nLook ahead to the next piece of homework that you will set for your class. When designing the homework, create a written model or worked example that demonstrates the implicit thought processes needed to successfully attempt the task. Pupils can use this model to scaffold their own thought processes.\n\nTo support this practical activity, you could look back at Week 2, when you considered worked examples.\n\n#### 3. Analyse artefacts\n\nReview a series of homework tasks you have previously set. It would be useful to bring a small set of homework with you to your mentor meeting, where you have annotated in the margin:\n\n- What range of learning tasks did you adopt?\n- What did you learn about your pupils when they completed the homework?\n- Was your (and their) focus more on the quality or the quantity?\n- Was there evidence of pupils regulating their own learning?\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBe ready to share this, and your other learning from this session, with your mentor in your next meeting with them.\n\n", nil, "5ff963e3-363c-45d5-8125-c0086e4065d5"],

We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Collaborative classroom talk – Year 11 geography</h3>\nIn Sarah’s Year 11 geography lesson, she wanted her pupils to think hard about different\neconomic and social measures of development (gross national income (GNI) per head,\nbirth and death rates, infant mortality, life expectancy, people per doctor, literacy\nrates, access to safe water, Human Development Index (HDI)) and the limitations of\nusing these economic and social measures.\n\nThe class contains 25 mixed-attainment pupils. The teacher has been trying to encourage effective collaborative talk throughout a range of different tasks during the year.\n\n<strong>How might Sarah make use of the strategies in this summary?</strong>\n$CTA\n\nCollaborative learning and dialogue are both effective ways of developing pupils’ learning at different stages, but are particularly helpful in supporting your pupils with practice. The evidence also highlights the importance of explicitly teaching and supporting both collaborative learning and classroom talk.\n\n**Collaborative learning** involves pupils working together, in pairs or small groups, where everyone can participate in a collective activity. This may involve each pupil taking responsibility for a part of the activity or all pupils working together on the same activity. The impact of collaborative learning approaches is typically positive, but studies find a wide range of effects. This suggests that it is important to consider how to do it most effectively.\n\nTo help you to establish collaborative learning that is effective and efficient, you should:\n\n- provide support and practice – effective collaborative learning requires more than just asking pupils to work together (e.g. explicitly teach routines and expectations, and repeat these each time you ask your pupils to work collaboratively)\n- carefully design tasks – collaborative learning will be ineffective if tasks are not designed so that pupils can work together effectively and efficiently. If this is not done, some pupils may opt to try and work alone (e.g. provide specific roles and responsibilities; rotate these so that the same pupils don’t get type-cast in the same roles; to avoid drifting off task, be strict on timing and clear about expected outcomes)\n- carefully group pupils – one of the benefits of collaborative learning is that pupils of different attainment levels can benefit from working with each other. Give consideration to the impact of specific grouping on behaviour and motivation (e.g. before grouping by friendship, ask yourself if this is likely to help or hinder their work)\n- use competition purposefully – competition can be an effective way of enhancing collaborative learning. However, it is not essential and it is likely to be unhelpful if competition becomes a distraction from the intended learning. (Carefully monitoring the impact of competition is likely to be useful: not all pupils respond positively to competition)\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Which of these strategies might Sarah consider essential for her geography\n  class, and which might she think are desirable? Which might she avoid?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Classroom talk** refers to the use of vocabulary and the quality of discussion by pupils as well as teachers. Encouraging pupils to use specific vocabulary and terminology during discussion in class helps to normalise and embed new words and improve the development of deep understanding. It broadens pupils’ vocabulary and helps them to articulate high-level ideas. Spoken language underpins both reading and writing development. Quality pupil talk positively affects academic attainment across the curriculum and children’s social and emotional development.\n\nTo help develop quality classroom talk, you should:\n\n- carefully consider how ground rules and pupil reflection can help build a supportive environment for talk (e.g. by agreeing on class rules for talk and keeping them on display)\n- create shared expectations and routines, such as listening to and respecting everyone, to support high-quality classroom talk (e.g. introducing specific frameworks and approaches that pupils can use to guide their talk. This may be as simple as providing specialist vocabulary or sentence stems to develop pupils’ thinking)\n- model polite, constructive talk by insisting on rules for turn-taking. (This can be more than ‘hands up’ – for example, it could include handovers such as ‘I agree with Sara because... I would like to challenge what Sami said...’)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  What Sarah did with her Year 11 geographers – Sarah explains her thinking\n</h3>\n‘I have been trying to encourage effective collaborative talk throughout a range\nof different tasks during the year. In GCSE geography, it’s a great way to get pupils\nto articulate the key ideas, consolidate their understanding and extend their vocabulary,\nbecause they have to explain their thinking to their peers.\n\n‘Mine is a mixed-attainment group; I have to pay close attention to the impact my groupings have on pupil attainment, their behaviour and motivation. I have a couple of pupils with tricky behaviour in there: they respond much better when they are familiar with routines. So, at the start of the year, I set up a system of grouping pupils into one of five ‘home’ and ‘away’ discussion groups. The 5 ‘home’ groups were named after continents, and the ‘away’ groups were named after ecosystems. The pupils had their ‘home’ and ‘away’ group name written on the front of their file. The ‘home’ groups were mixed attainment groups, whereas the ‘away’ groups were based on prior attainment levels. In order to do this I also had to take into account the pupils’ prior knowledge of the topic. The pupils feel a sense of responsibility towards their groups, which I occasionally reinforce with competition. I am certain this has boosted their intrinsic motivation.\n\n‘I never do collaborative work just for the sake of it: it must always be about thinking harder about and achieving a deeper understanding of the subject and the exam. For this, they need guidance, support and practice. So, in the first stage of the lesson on different economic and social measures of development, pupils worked in ‘home’ groups. They were given a range of keywords, definitions and pictures which exemplified the core concepts of the lesson. Once they had developed their understanding of these concepts, I questioned the different groups about each measure of development to further embed their understanding. In the second phase of the lesson I told them to move into their away groups. At this point I gave a series of differentiated questions set to challenge the different prior attainment groups in the class. In the final stages of the lesson, I asked them to create their own ‘best’ measure of development.’\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  Ben, an A-Level history teacher, shares another approach to high-quality group\n  talk\n</h3>\n<strong>The issue</strong>: In A-Level history, pupils are required to make judgements\nabout the validity of general statements and the claims of other historians. My Year\n12s were preparing for an essay answering the question “Was Henry VIII’s foreign\npolicy from 1509-1527 a success?”\n\n<strong>How he grouped them</strong>: I put pupils into groups of mixed ability\nbased on how they had tackled their previous essay. Person 1 in each group had\nthe weakest skills in this area, Person 4 had the strongest.\n\nWe used the following scaffold to structure discussion.\n\n‘What would “success” look like for Henry VIII in terms of his foreign policy 1509–1527?’\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Suggest a definition for success.</li>\n  <li>\n    Ask a question about the definition – Person 1 should respond to your\n    question.\n  </li>\n  <li>Suggest a change to the definition in the light of this discussion.</li>\n  <li>\n    Ask a further question about the definition and then draft a final\n    definition which the whole group should then agree before all writing down\n    an answer.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<strong>How he modelled group talk</strong>: As this was a skill that was not yet\ntotally embedded with this class, I had already scripted an exemplar discussion using\na similar question about ‘Henry VII’s foreign policy’ and we modelled this with one\nof the groups. This helped to re-activate prior knowledge, provided some guidance\nabout the types of comments that could be made and gave additional support to pupils\nwho were not confident about the process.\n\n<strong>Why it was successful</strong>: The success of the essay would rely on\npupils understanding the different concepts involved in this task. It doesn’t\nfocus specifically on knowledge - although a different task could - as this will\nbe the next stage in the process (having defined success – was it actually a\nsuccess?). (4.7)\n\nBy using the 1–4 approach and assigning different tasks or roles to each number it was possible to provide relevant challenge and support for each pupil based on their prior attainment. (4.10) This grouping was carefully assigned based on prior assessment and a secure knowledge of pupil ability in relation to this particular skill. (4o)\n\nProviding a scaffold for discussion meant that all pupils were clear about their role in the discussion and it was clear that all pupils had a key role to play in the success of the activity. (4.9) Once pupils are confident with this approach (as a result of opportunities to practise) then it may not be necessary to include the worked examples as part of the set-up and ultimately, pupils should be able to have these discussions without using the scaffold.\n\nIn addition to ensuring that all pupils were involved, this scaffold and the modelled approach increased the quality of discussion and the rigour of the dialogue as pupils were able to question, challenge assumptions and re-frame in the light of other people’s input.

Independent planning\n\nPlanning for different groupings. Perhaps, in your self-assessment above, you said you ‘rarely’ give opportunities for structured classroom talk, or for collaborating in different grouping; or perhaps you said you ‘always’ do. You are now going to plan a lesson in two different ways. Use this opportunity to experiment a little:\n\n- Think about a lesson that you will be delivering next week with a particular group of pupils.\n- With a clear learning intention in mind produce two different ways of grouping your pupils (e.g. mixed attainment or near-attainment? Mixed gender or single gender? All in pairs, or all in fours?

You discussed the need to locate the education of children with SEND within inclusive policy and practice, with emphasis on improving the whole learning environment and the combination of teaching and learning processes applicable to all children. This is an approach that should serve to prevent some children from needing to be identified as having special educational needs.\n\nIn this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of teaching pupils with special educational needs. You will consider where to access the information you need to inform planning and explore the range of strategies that can be deployed when teaching pupils with a variety of different needs and backgrounds. Alongside this you will also consider again the importance of grouping pupils effectively.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice.** When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\nMolly is a Year 8 pupil with a moderate learning difficulty. She has been identified as having limited working memory capacity, which means she has difficulty in memorising important concepts and factual information crucial to her success in most subjects. Teachers regularly observe that Molly will remember something within a lesson, and a day later appears to have no recollection of this information.\n\n<strong>\n  What challenges could this difficulty pose for Molly if you were teaching her?{\" \"}\n</strong>\n<strong>\n  What steps could be put in place during a lesson to ensure information is\n  embedded for Molly?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Barriers to learning** are specific factors which prevent pupils from making progress and acquiring new knowledge and skills. These can be additional learning needs such as dyslexia, or external factors such as bereavement or challenging home circumstances. There can also be barriers to learning within the classroom, such as poor behaviour or lack of facilities and equipment. A pupil’s socio-economic circumstances can also result in significant barriers to learning.\n\nTo help you identify and overcome pupils’ barriers to learning, you should:\n\n- work closely with the SENCO, your Designated Safeguarding Lead and other special education professionals who work in or visit your school\n- use the SEND Code of Practice, which has guidance on supporting SEND pupils\n- learn more about your pupils’ barriers by liaising with their families and other colleagues\n- if you have them, talk to teaching assistants or learning support advisors who may be keyworkers for the pupils you teach\n\n$I\nMolly’s teachers know that she has a moderate learning difficulty but they may not all understand what strategies have proven to work well for her. Specialist and experienced colleagues can help with this, such as the SENCO; the SEND Code of Practice contains practical guidance. Molly’s family have a lot of insight into what helps their daughter succeed; they can help guide her at home as well as talking to her teachers about these strategies.\n$I\n\nOne of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ **prior knowledge** within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there, rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load. When pupils encounter familiar problems, this activates information from long-term memory and supports working memory, where problem-solving occurs. Novice pupils therefore find complex activities like problem-solving, critical thinking and creativity particularly effortful, as they have fewer experiences (and therefore less prior knowledge) and the problems they encounter are more likely to be novel. Where prior knowledge is weak, inaccurate or misapplied, it can have a distorting effect both on the immediate activity, and on the learning that results from this.\n\nTo help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils where they have specific learning needs, you should:\n\n- wherever possible, talk to colleagues who taught them before, or who teach them in other areas now, so you can benefit from their experience\n- carefully assess their prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (you may have to adapt your teaching in-lesson, as you realise that their prior knowledge is not secure)\n- provide explicit modelling and guidance, breaking problems down into steps (e.g. keywords and sentence starters for written work, simple teacher demonstration for practical tasks)\n- use worked examples with clear and minimal steps (including step-by-step visual guides)\n- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (if you are able to co-plan with colleagues, that will help here)\n- give them regular purposeful practice so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Which of these strategies would be likely to be effective with Molly?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Adaptive teaching** involves the teacher being flexible and responsive about the methods they use in lessons, to ensure that they can meet the needs of all their pupils and deviate from the lesson plan where necessary. Adaptive teaching requires a reflective approach, since the teacher needs to be able to acknowledge the need to change the strategy being used. Although adaptive teaching is easier with experience, it can be achieved early in a teacher’s career through careful planning – by anticipating pupil misconceptions before they arise, for example. It is important that this be done in response to pupils’ needs, not an artificial process which breaks the flow of the lesson. Adaptive teaching includes providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, but creating separate distinct tasks for different groups is less likely to be valuable: it risks lowering expectations for some, and it can add unnecessarily to workload.\n\nTo adapt your teaching without creating separate distinct tasks you should:\n\n- intervene within lessons with individuals and small groups (e.g. as Mr Andrews did with Molly)\n- divide your support between the whole class, specific groups and individuals (e.g. it is often possible to set up a whole-class independent task, freeing you to give extra support to a group or individual)\n- while maintaining high expectations for all, you can vary the quantity of work you demand from some or the amount of time you allow some to complete it\n- use and reuse templates, writing frames, key concepts mats and other worked examples as scaffolds you can easily introduce or withdraw as you adapt your teaching\n\n$I\nMr Andrews (as you will see next) mainly adapted his teaching for Molly in this lesson by dividing his support between her and the whole class, and by using visual prompts as a scaffold he could introduce and gradually remove.\n$I\n\nDeliberate, purposeful **practice** is essential if pupils are to retain the new knowledge and skills they have been taught. This requires the pupils themselves to put sustained effort into improving their performance within a given domain. Deliberate practice is positively correlated with performance. Each time memories are recalled, they are strengthened. In order to embed new learning in their long-term memory and be able to retrieve it for future use, pupils need to regularly retrieve new knowledge and skills, and apply them in new and diverse contexts.\n\nTo help your pupils with specific learning needs to learn through practice you should:\n\n- design learning sequences that give your pupils regular opportunities to practise, and to retrieve from memory what they have previously learned (so much the better if you can make this low-stakes and low-stress)\n- design practice tasks to ensure a high success rate for your pupils, but\n- over time, increase the challenge, for example by removing scaffolding or by increasing the length of time between visits to the topic\n\n$I\nMr Andrews planned a Year 8 lesson on the ‘problems of living in a city’. The pupils were provided with several paragraphs of information on the given topic. Pupils needed to break down the information via a series of small illustrations/symbols, which would later serve as visual memory prompts. Pupils could write only a maximum of four key words to support their work.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    For Molly, the next step to secure this knowledge further was to have her\n    use her illustrations and word prompts to recall this information verbally\n    to a study partner, before attempting any comprehension work or written work\n    about the topic. Beforehand, Mr Andrews modelled for them how he wanted them\n    to conduct their paired talk. He knows that pairings such as this can\n    increase success for Molly, but also that he needs to give her and her\n    partner clear guidance. He has discovered that, for now at least, this\n    pairing seems to have improved the behaviour and motivation of both Molly\n    and her partner, but he is keeping an eye on this and will assess the impact\n    also on their attainment.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Using easy visual prompts gave Molly an extra step in embedding the\n    information. Using these regularly across a series of lessons, and gradually\n    taking the visual prompts away, ensured Molly could transfer this\n    information more easily into her long-term memory. Mr Andrews is prepared to\n    give Molly this specific type of support because he is aware that she learns\n    at a different rate to most of the other pupils in the class.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic.

You might further apply your knowledge of how flexible grouping can impact upon pupil achievement. You consider again the adapted support that pupils with barriers to learning, including SEND, may need to progress in their learning.\n\nYou can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  Teaching new vocabulary to a group with a wide range of needs – a Year 5 class\n</h3>\nMiss Gascoigne has a Year 5 class consisting of pupils with a variety of learning\nneeds. She is beginning a new topic – the Ancient Egyptians – which will require\npupils to understand challenging vocabulary and employ it with accuracy in their\nown writing.\n\n<strong>\n  Which of the strategies in this summary could she use to plan for the needs of\n  her class?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Pre-teaching** is the process of teaching a new concept to selected pupils prior to a lesson on the subject. This might, for example, involve teaching new vocabulary or a new mathematical concept before the first lesson on a topic, so that pupils who may otherwise struggle are able to access and keep up with the learning. The approach works equally well for all pupils.\n\nFurther examples of pre-teaching include:\n\n- setting pre-reading as homework, so that pupils are more able to engage with the vocabulary and ideas in the lesson itself (this can be supported by parents/carers)\n- independent research into a topic (e.g. the works of a famous artist, designer or musician) as a stimulus for the following lesson\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Do you think Miss Gascoigne is likely to want to pre-teach the vocabulary for\n  the new topic?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nAs you have seen already, one of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ prior knowledge within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there, rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load. As children develop, they accrue more knowledge across a range of contexts, and this reduces the load on their working memory, allowing them to solve problems more rapidly.\n\nTo help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils, particularly as they learn at different rates, you should:\n\n- wherever possible, talk to colleagues who taught them before, or who teach them in other areas now, so you can benefit from their experience\n- carefully assess their prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (you may have to adapt your teaching in lesson, as you realise that their prior knowledge is not secure)\n- provide explicit modelling and guidance, breaking problems down into steps (e.g., keywords and sentence starters for written work, simple teacher demonstration for practical tasks)\n- use worked examples with clear and minimal steps (including step-by-step visual guides)\n- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (if you are able to co-plan with colleagues, that will help here)\n- give them regular purposeful practice so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory\n\n$I\nBefore beginning the topic, Miss Gascoigne does a word reading test to identify vocabulary that is familiar to pupils and to what extent they understand it. The list included: archaeology, pyramid, pharaoh, slavery, River Nile, and Nefertiti. Her aim is for pupils to be able to identify words and then be able to place them in context and remember them. This will reduce the load on their working memory as they learn new information. This small piece of pre-teaching allowed her to circumvent some of the misconceptions that may have become established.\n$I\n\n**Formative assessment** (or assessment for learning) is used to directly inform the teaching and learning process (i.e. when evidence gathered on pupils is used to make adaptations to teaching and learning). Dylan Wiliam describes it in terms of how ‘teachers and learners use information about student achievement, to make adjustments to the student’s learning that improve their achievement.’\n\nTo support pupil learning through effective formative assessment, you could draw on five key strategies for embedding formative assessment, outlined by Dylan Wiliam:\n\n- clarifying, understanding and sharing learning intentions (e.g. by sharing clear success criteria for pupils at the outset of learning activities)\n- engineering effective classroom discussions, tasks and activities that elicit evidence of learning (e.g. by using questioning and other forms of gathering information on pupil learning regularly throughout and across lessons)\n- providing feedback that moves learners forward (e.g. by being explicit about what pupils should do next to improve their learning)\n- activating students as learning resources for one another (e.g. by explicitly teaching strategies, such as peer-assessment)\n- activating students as owners of their own learning (e.g. by explicitly teaching pupils strategies to monitor and regulate their own learning)\n\nYou will return to formative and other forms of assessment in Module 4.\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Why is formative assessment so important to Miss Gascoigne as she teaches her\n  pupils the vocabulary for the new topic?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Reframing questions** is more than simply rewording them. If a pupil can’t answer a question, reframing it can allow them to approach it from a different angle. For example, rather than asking a pupil to ‘explain their reasoning’ for statement X, the teacher might ask them to provide reasons for and against believing statement X to be true. This may help the pupil realise they don’t always have to align themselves with one particular line of reasoning, and to view problems and topics more holistically. Reframing questions can also help the teacher diagnose barriers to learning and help pupils think problems through rather than simply giving up at the first sign of difficulty.\n\nTo help all your pupils make better progress, you can reframe questions to:\n\n- provide more support for those who need it by offering greater scaffolding (e.g. by narrowing down the options in an answer: ‘What were causes of the Great War?... Name me an important cause of the War... Was it important that the great powers had been building up their armies and navies before the War?’)\n- stretch those pupils who are ready for it (e.g. by politely challenging their reasoning: ‘Shamim, why do some people in the class disagree with your answer?... Shamim, try to change my mind about this...’)\n\n**Relationships** between teachers and **parents/carers** are generally considered crucial to a child’s educational experience. Sometimes, we use other terms to mean similar things (e.g. parental involvement, engagement, participation). Attending a parents’ evening may be considered as ‘parental involvement’ with the school, whilst parents/carers regularly reading with their child would come under the heading of ‘parental engagement’ with learning. Building effective relationships with families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success; it can help teachers to better understand their pupils’ individual circumstances so that they can be effectively supported in school. Schools always need to nurture their relationships with families, but this is probably even more important for families of children with special educational needs or disabilities.\n\nTo help you to build effective relationships with parents, carers and families, you should:\n\n- speak to the pastoral teams in your school and get their advice\n- prepare well for parents’ evenings, making sure you know well what your pupils’ strengths are, what they need to do to improve and what families might be able to do to help\n- where you have concerns about how best to communicate with a family, ask a trusted colleague to help you to script some scenarios\n\nSchools work with parents/carers in diverse ways depending upon the community in which they serve. The Education Endowment Foundation’s (2015) ‘Working with parents to support children’s learning’ is a very useful guidance report.\n\n$I\nAfter the pre-lesson word reading test, Miss Gascoigne sent the test home with the pupils with a request that parents rehearse the words with their children.\n\nBy identifying the prior knowledge of her pupils, Miss Gascoigne was able to plan effectively for the range of needs in the classroom, using strategies to both support and challenge pupils learning at different rates. To ensure mastery of more complex vocabulary, she used a range of strategies:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>she explained the meaning with child-friendly definitions</li>\n  <li>she provided examples of how the vocabulary is used</li>\n  <li>she asked the children to repeat the word at least 3 times</li>\n  <li>\n    she planned activities to use the word correctly (verbal sentences,\n    sentences on whiteboard, word searches, act out the word, close texts)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    to support their long-term memory, the vocabulary was posted on a word wall,\n    and the words were reviewed daily for a week or so\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBefore teaching the topic, Miss Gascoigne conducted a word reading test because she\nrealised that, for many, lack of prior knowledge of the words would be a barrier\nto their learning on the topic. This test also doubled as a form of pre-teaching,\nwhich was an extra assistance for those who are learning at a different rate. Because\nshe has built good relations with the parents of her pupils, she was confident of\ntheir support when she sent the word test home for them to rehearse with their children.\nThe range of strategies that she then used in the lesson supported all the pupils\nto expand their working vocabularies. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic.

You will remember, as you script, your 3 pupils A, B and C, and that:\n\n- 5.1 pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed\n- 5.2 seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching\n- 5.7 pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential\n\n| Parts of the lesson                  | Ideas for your script                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Introducing learning intentions      | Who can tell me what our learning intentions mean?                                                          |\n| Asking and responding to questions   | Would someone like to agree with C’s answer there, and give a reason?                                       |\n| Giving instructions                  | Now you have heard the instruction from me, tell your partner in your own words what it is I want you to do |\n| Setting up peer- and self-assessment | What were the 3 best parts of the work?

In your script, you reframed questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch.\n\nIn this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of why it is important to evaluate pupils’ knowledge, understanding and skills - this could be via discussions with pupils, during whole class feedback, checking classwork or summative assessment of their work. When certain pupils need more help to improve their knowledge, understanding and skills, it is crucial that the teacher identifies what help they need and the best way to adapt their teaching to support them. It is best if this does not involve creating a separate lesson plan, tasks or set of resources. The idea that lessons need to cater for pupils’ ‘learning styles’ has been debunked and does not improve learning.\n\nYou can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>\n  Making new concepts accessible through targeted support – Year 12 Psychology\n</h3>\nConn is struggling with his Year 12 A Level Psychology class: the pupils are having\ndifficulties communicating their prior understanding of complex concepts and so are\nfailing to apply this knowledge to solving problems. He has tried a number of things,\nincluding personalising resources for each member of the class and teaching them\naccording to what they have told him are their preferred learning styles. He is now\noverloaded with work and still not happy with the progress his pupils are making.\n\n<strong>\n  Why might pupils be struggling to communicate their prior knowledge?{\" \"}\n</strong>\n<strong>\n  Why might Conn’s hard work not be producing the outcomes he wants?{\" \"}\n</strong>\n<strong>\n  How might he better target his support so that the pupils access the new\n  concepts?{\" \"}\n</strong>\n<strong>\n  Which of the strategies in this summary could he use to plan for the needs of\n  his class?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Adaptive teaching** involves the teacher being flexible and responsive about the methods they use in lessons to ensure that they can meet the needs of all their pupils and deviate from the lesson plan where necessary. Adaptive teaching requires a reflective approach, since the teacher needs to be able to acknowledge the need to change the strategy being used. Although adaptive teaching is easier with experience, it can be achieved early in a teacher’s career through careful planning – by anticipating pupil misconceptions before they arise, for example. It is important that this is done in response to pupils’ needs, not an artificial process which breaks the flow of the lesson.\n\nAdaptive teaching includes providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, but creating separate, distinct tasks for different groups is less likely to be valuable: it risks lowering expectations for some, and it can add unnecessarily to workload.\n\nTo help your pupils make progress you should:\n\n- use formative assessment to identify those who need content further broken down\n- adapt your lessons but keep your expectations high for all\n- change your groups frequently\n- rather than plan different tasks and lessons, intervene within lessons with individuals and small groups\n\n$I\nConn changed his approach. Alongside better scaffolding of information, the teacher decided to group his pupils based on current assessment data. In order to target his support, he planned a group work lesson on ‘attachment’, which used a variety of scaffolding prompts to remind the students of the concepts and knowledge required to show an understanding of attachment. These prompts included a short video on the ‘nature v nurture’ debate and some key associated words such as ‘secure’ and ‘insecure avoidant’ and ‘insecure resistant’. He stopped planning towards his pupils’ preferred learning styles because it wasn’t helping.\n$I\n\n**Critical knowledge** is the essential information and concepts pupils need to learn the next steps in an area of the curriculum. It is linked to the idea of foundational concepts. Critical knowledge might be a key concept or piece of vocabulary, for example, or a mathematical process without which the next steps can’t be made.\n\nIt is important that the curriculum is carefully sequenced so that pupils learn **foundational concepts** first – concepts that are needed in order to understand more complex information. Examples of foundational concepts include learning the alphabet and phonetic sounds in literacy; learning to count, add and subtract in mathematics; and learning about cells and atoms in science. Over time, building up foundational understanding can help pupils develop confidence in their ability to recall relevant information while their knowledge gradually becomes more complex, and external support (or scaffolding) is gradually withdrawn.\n\nTo help your pupils master foundational concepts, you should:\n\n- with your colleagues, identify what these are and ensure they are prioritised in your curriculum\n- with your colleagues, identify the likely common misconceptions that can hamper understanding of the important concepts\n- give concrete examples and metaphors as these are often useful in helping pupils understand abstract concepts (e.g. stories and narratives, sayings, rules, mnemonics, equations and models)\n\n$I\nConn’s pupils were able to use the scaffolds and prompts to access their prior understanding and work collaboratively to produce a labelled diagram of nature versus nurture. By using current assessment data, he was able to identify knowledge gaps that were common across particular groups of pupils and group them according to their more specific needs. Conn was able to focus more time in lesson to help specific groups develop their diagrams. He could reframe questions and give extra modelling to the groups with struggling pupils when required to maintain the level of discussion in the group and promote deeper understanding. He didn’t produce a different lesson plan or resources for them or have a separate set of learning outcomes. Instead, he focused on foundational concepts. Other groups could work independently of the teacher, without additional scaffolding, to complete the finished product.\n\nDuring the lesson, the teacher moved around the room and used questioning to check individual pupils’ understanding. By doing this, he was able to identify where additional/less scaffolding was required and adapt his intervention accordingly.\n$I\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  What did Conn learn about making new concepts accessible through targeted\n  support?\n</h3>\nConn saved time by not producing extra resources for the class, instead refocusing\nhis attention in lesson to target his support where it was needed. Grouping his pupils\nusing their current assessment data helped him to achieve this in a way that meant\nhe did not need to have separate learning objectives or resources. He learned that\nteaching to preferred learning styles didn’t help the pupils and only added to his\nworkload. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n**Analyse artefacts**\n\nConn adapted his teaching, and avoided having to produce separate lesson resources, by distributing his attention across the groups he had formed using his Year 12 current assessment data. He was able to teach his class the new concepts they needed. Another way to achieve this outcome is by making adaptive use of a teaching resource.\n\nThink of a lesson that you have coming up, or a topic that you will need to teach soon. Find a single rich resource that you can use to teach your whole class. It might be a textbook or a curriculum resource that already exists in a shared staff area; alternatively, it could be an online resource such as a video or animation.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\n**1. Independent planning**\n\nWrite a plan for a lesson that will be observed by your mentor (or you can record a 15-minute section of the lesson.) The purpose of this observation is to demonstrate specific targeted support to groups of pupils with the aim of encouraging the learning of the key concepts but without having to artificially produce separate resources or tasks. You will use the single rich resource you found above.\n\nYou should think about what you have learned about adaptive teaching, e.g.,\n\n- how you identify pupils who need extra support\n- how you identify what they need extra support with\n- how you give the extra support, without creating additional resources and tasks but by adapting the single rich resource for all pupils\n- how you might use more intensive pre-teaching, peer-assisted learning, small group discussions or additional homework and questions\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nArrange to record 15 minutes of this lesson or for your mentor or another colleague to observe 15 minutes of it. If neither is possible, make sure you write a detailed lesson plan, and then annotate it later with notes on how the strategies you tried succeeded or not.\n\n", nil, "b4fe1482-325c-425d-8b04-f02b4b312306"],

We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>High-quality expositions and efficiency – Year 9 English</h3>\nMrs Turner has found that her Year 9 English class are struggling to grasp some foundational\nconcepts in the current scheme of learning on War Poetry. They produce a lot of written\nwork but when she has marked their books, she has found that there are misconceptions\nand misunderstandings. She has spent a lot of time during the lesson explaining background\ninformation to the concepts but the pupils’ knowledge hasn’t improved.\n\n<strong>\n  What strategies could Mrs Turner employ to tackle these problems?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Efficiency** can be thought of as ‘the reduction of waste’. The most common resource that can be wasted in teaching is time, leading to an overall increase in teachers’ workload. Reducing wasted time is a key priority for teachers and school leaders.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of efficiency as the relationship between time taken and quality of outcome, because it doesn’t always follow that reducing time spent on an activity is a good thing per se. Teaching is intellectual labour, and some parts of a teacher’s work take time because they are hard to do well. For example, when planning to introduce a new foundational concept, rushing the planning of a lesson may mean that pupils do not learn that concept well, affecting many future lessons.\n\nSchools and multi-academy trusts develop their own policies and practices around assessment, marking and feedback. They are encouraged to be mindful of the impact upon teacher workload of assessment practices, which can be onerous. Teachers need to be aware of their school’s expectations of marking and should also seek ways of minimising the potentially negative impacts of doing it excessively. Self- and peer-assessment both have pedagogical advantages and can help reduce marking workload.\n\nTo help you save time without significantly impacting the quality of outcomes, you could make marking manageable and effective by:\n\n- recording data only when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes\n- working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback (e.g. using whole-class feedback via a visualiser, or well-supported peer- and self-assessment)\n- using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons where possible. (Some schools may encourage using verbal feedback stamps, but remember this also uses up time and may not help improve outcomes for your pupils)\n- using departmental or phase team time to moderate and standardise assessment (this is also a great form of subject-specific professional development)\n\nAnd you can make planning manageable by:\n\n- making use of existing well-designed resources (e.g. textbooks, exam board-approved exemplars, online stores of graphics and animations, carefully selected commercial schemes of work)\n- doing it collaboratively with colleagues (e.g. during shared PPA time or during time set aside for department/phase development)\n\n$CTA\n\n<strong>\n  Which strategies might be effective in reducing wasted time both in and out of\n  lessons?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nIt is important that the curriculum is carefully sequenced so that pupils learn** foundational concepts** first – concepts that are needed in order to understand more complex information. Examples of foundational concepts include learning the alphabet and phonetic sounds in literacy; learning to count, add and subtract in mathematics; and learning about cells and atoms in science. Over time, building up foundational understanding can help pupils develop confidence in their ability to recall relevant information while their knowledge gradually becomes more complex, and external support (or scaffolding) is gradually withdrawn.\n\nTo help your pupils to master foundational concepts, you should:\n\n- with your colleagues, identify what these are and ensure they are prioritised in your curriculum\n- with your colleagues, identify the likely common misconceptions that can hamper understanding of the important concepts\n- give concrete examples and metaphors as these are often useful in helping pupils understand abstract concepts (e.g. stories and narratives, sayings, rules, mnemonics, equations and models)\n\n$I\nMrs Turner decided to take a look at the scheme of learning and identify where there may be misconceptions and misunderstandings in future lessons. A key problem pupils had was understanding historical context in relation to the themes of the text they were studying. She identified potential pitfalls in future lessons and found time to sit with her class’s history teacher, who helped her locate a five-minute video which depicted conditions in trenches on the Western Front. He also gave her a history textbook from which she was able to compile a glossary of key terms, such as ‘trench-foot’, ‘morning hate’ and ‘no man’s land’. Collaborating with this teacher saved them both time, as he now has a better idea of the war poetry they study. Mrs Turner was able to create resources to support and challenge her pupils.\n$I\n\n**Exposition** refers to the process of explaining concepts, ideas and information with great clarity. It requires the teacher to have sound knowledge of the curriculum area and involves ensuring that pupils are able to understand new information in the context of their prior knowledge and understanding. Exposition is about more than simply telling pupils information. It also involves providing examples to illustrate and illuminate the material to be learned. Examples can include visual and conceptual models, application of rules, and contextual information. Good exposition may also involve modelling. Exposition does not require pupils to make discoveries themselves: by moving from the general to the specific, it allows pupils to understand increasingly detailed explanations of the material to be learned and link those explanations to information presented previously as part of a general overview.\n\nTo help your pupils learn through more effective exposition, you should:\n\n- plan what you are going to say and how you are going to model to your pupils (e.g. by rehearsing how you will explain foundational concepts)\n- think about the visuals and examples you can use that will help your pupils connect this new learning with what they already know\n- be prepared to break down your expositions further for those pupils who may need it\n- allow time also for pupils to practise: don’t simply rely upon exposition (in your plan, allot a time limit to your expositions; this will help you keep to your point)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What Mrs Turner did</h3>\nMrs Turner showed the five-minute video she had borrowed from her history colleague\nto her class, at the end of the previous lesson. She said she would be quizzing them\non it in the next lesson. She also gave them the glossary of terms connected with\ntrench warfare for them to learn at home.\n\nShe started her next lesson with the promised quiz on the video. She rearranged the pupils’ seating plan as a result, creating a ‘support table’ for those who had done less well on the quiz. She showed the video to the whole class again because she believed that would ease the load on their working memories. In her plan, she scripted her main exposition to the class, being careful to include several of the terms from the glossary and to connect these to the concepts she wanted them to grapple with in 2 poems by Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. This all took 15 minutes, and she was able to allow her pupils to spend most of the remainder of the lesson on independent practice, first in groups of four to generate and refine ideas, and then individually. Mrs Turner was able to use the independent practice time to target her support on the ‘support table’ of pupils who had done less well on the video quiz. With them, she reused her quiz questions and glossary as the main resources to re-teach them.\n\nMrs Turner recognised that her class’s hard work was not the same as effective learning: they were still stumbling over foundational concepts, even though they were producing a lot of writing. She used the resources of her history colleague – the video and glossary – knowing that they would be of high quality and pitched correctly for the age of her pupils. She used these to pre-teach (through homework and the last few minutes of the previous lesson) some of the keywords and concepts she would need her class to be familiar with. That meant in her lesson, through the quiz and exposition, she was able to connect new content to their existing knowledge. Her exposition was brief and – because she had scripted it – she made sure it was to the point. This allowed her class plenty of time to work independently. In turn, this afforded her the chance to give extra in-class support to the group who had struggled with the quiz on the video. Rather than create new resources for them, she reused the same materials as with the whole of the class. This made more efficient use of her planning time.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic.

She’s\ntaught this topic before and knows that pupils typically struggle with some of the\ncore ideas underpinning the topic.\n\n<strong>\n  What could Seda do to check her pupils’ existing understanding of these core\n  ideas at the start of the topic?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Assessment** is a broad term, covering a wide range of teaching and learning activity. ‘Assessment of learning’ (or summative assessment), used after a period of teaching/learning, aims to find out what pupils know or can do at a given point in time. ‘Assessment for learning’ (or formative assessment), used during a period of teaching/learning, aims to find out where pupils are now and where they need to go next, as well as to provide feedback on how to get there. Assessment may also be used to establish pupils’ prior knowledge and understanding at the outset of a sequence of learning. With these different purposes come different methods of assessment. Assessment can add significantly to a teacher’s workload, so it is important to become familiar with your school’s expectations and to learn efficient methods from colleagues.\n\nPeer-assessment and self-assessment can be valuable tools that enable pupils to check their own progress against agreed success criteria. However, pupils first need to be trained in how to do this well, and the approaches work best alongside teacher assessment rather than as an alternative. These approaches are explored further in week 4 of this module.\n\n**Formative assessment** (or assessment for learning) is assessment which is used to directly inform the teaching and learning process – i.e. when evidence gathered on pupils is used to make adaptations to teaching and learning. Dylan Wiliam describes it in terms of how ‘teachers and learners use information about student achievement to make adjustments to the student’s learning that improve their achievement.’\n\nTo support pupil learning through effective formative assessment, you could draw on five key strategies for embedding formative assessment, outlined by Dylan Wiliam, which are:\n\n- clarifying, understanding and sharing learning intentions (e.g. by sharing clear success criteria for pupils at the outset of learning activities by using a checklist or by modelling ‘what a good one looks like’)\n- engineering effective classroom discussions, tasks and activities that elicit evidence of learning (e.g. by regularly using questioning and other ways of gathering information on pupil learning throughout and across lessons - this could include: quizzes, observing pupils as they work independently or discuss ideas with peers, checking pupils’ work during lesson time to monitor their progress, structured class discussions)\n- providing feedback that moves learners forward (e.g. by being explicit about what pupils should do next to improve their learning)\n- activating students as learning resources for one another (e.g. by explicitly teaching strategies such as peer-assessment)\n- activating students as owners of their own learning (e.g. by explicitly teaching pupils strategies to monitor and regulate their own learning)\n\n$I\nSeda could use these strategies with her class by planning some activities at the beginning of the topic which encourage pupils to share their current understanding about the core ideas. This would give her the information she needs to plan the rest of the topic. She could devise a few diagnostic questions and use whole-class response techniques to gather responses from all pupils. Pupils could respond by:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    writing short answers (up to a sentence) on a mini-whiteboard and holding\n    these up so the teacher can see all answers at once\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    using their fingers to respond to a multiple-choice question with numbered\n    optional responses (i.e. if they think the answer is option 1, they hold up\n    1 finger; if option 4, 4 fingers)\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBefore collecting answers from pupils, Seda could give them a chance to discuss their\nideas in small groups or with talk partners. This gives pupils a chance to share\ntheir thinking in a low-stakes environment and build confidence before sharing their\nanswers with the whole class. $I\n\n**Summative assessment** sums up, at a given time (for example, the end of a unit), where learners are in their learning. It is also referred to as ‘assessment of learning’, in contrast to ‘assessment for learning’. Summative assessments are often more useful and reliable when compared against an external benchmark and conducted in controlled conditions. This should improve the reliability of the information that the teacher gets from the assessment.\n\nIt can be helpful to schedule your summative assessment a little before the end of the time available for teaching a given topic (e.g. in week 4 of a 5-week topic). This allows time (e.g. in week 5) for you and your pupils to address any learning needs picked up in the assessment by revisiting content that pupils have learned less well.\n\nTo help you make effective summative assessments, you could:\n\n- use externally validated materials where possible, such as a previous national test paper and mark scheme\n\n- if several classes in one year group are to take the same summative assessment\n\n  - give all the pupils the same notice and chance to prepare, so that you can compare across groups more accurately\n  - work with your colleagues to plan the assessment, minimising excessive workload for individuals\n\n**Questioning** is one way that teachers can check pupils’ prior knowledge and understanding and identify misconceptions or gaps in knowledge. Questions also have other purposes, as explored in Module 3.\n\nQuestions can be structured in different ways according to their purpose. Multiple-choice questions are useful for identifying common misconceptions and determining whether pupils can ‘recognise’ correct answers – a helpful stepping stone toward their being able to retrieve or recall information in the absence of retrieval cues. However, writing successful multiple-choice questions is complex if they are to be of most impact in both developing and assessing pupil learning. Hinge questions are a particular type of multiple-choice question that help teachers check whether pupils have understood important information that has to be mastered before moving on to the next part of the learning sequence. Hinge questions will be explored further in week 3 of Module 4.\n\nTo use questions to support the accurate and productive use of assessment, you could:\n\n- use multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions during lessons (a good source of well-constructed multiple-choice questions can be past examination papers, if these are available in your phase and specialism)\n- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that correct answers stem from secure understanding (e.g. ‘tell me how you reached that answer’, ‘what tells you that this is the correct answer?’ or ‘can you explain to me why this answer is incorrect?’)\n\n$I\nHigh-quality multiple-choice questions make use of all options to tell the teacher something about pupils’ understanding:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>there can be one correct answer or more than one</li>\n  <li>\n    the incorrect answers, or ‘distractors’, are linked to common errors or\n    misunderstandings - the design of these incorrect answers should be\n    approached as carefully as the design of the correct answer(s)\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBy noting which incorrect answers pupils give, teachers can learn more about the\nmisunderstandings that pupils hold. This helps the teacher to decide what to do next\nin their teaching.\n\nIn Seda’s case, she could use her knowledge of the typical errors that pupils have made when she taught this topic previously to help her to write a usefully diagnostic question, or questions, to frame her initial assessment of pupils’ understanding.\n$I\n\n**Performance** is used to describe ‘what a pupil can do at a given moment.’ How well they do in a test, for example, can be described as their performance. Teachers draw inferences about what pupils have learned by looking at their performance in assessments. Externally validated assessment instruments – exams and standardised tests – are useful for determining a pupil’s current level of performance within a particular domain. However, there are disadvantages to the use of high-stakes tests, since a single point of assessment (performance) is, by definition, not a reliable measure of what a pupil has really learned. It is therefore more valid and reliable to draw conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments. You will explore this idea further in the ECT training session for this module.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Seda do? The principles of assessment in practice</h3>\nSeda decides to write several multiple-choice questions as a starter activity, with\ncommon misconceptions built into the distractors (wrong answers). Pupils quickly\ntackle the questions. Seda asks them to then discuss and justify their answers with\ntheir talk partners – talk partners are set by the seating plan and have been arranged\ntaking account of pupils’ prior attainment, behaviour for learning and personalities. She\ncirculates the room to listen to discussions, noting where pupils have strong understanding\nin some cases and important misconceptions in others.\n\nSeda selects some pairs to explain their answers to each question and the reasoning behind these answers. She uses further questioning and discussion to encourage pupils to expand on their answers and to highlight and correct the misconceptions she noted previously in relation to Puritan beliefs and roles in Elizabethan society.\n\nSeda was aware of the typical confusion pupils experience in differentiating religious groups in Elizabethan England; she knew that identifying and clarifying those misconceptions was essential to pupils understanding the new topic. Using multiple-choice questioning with deliberate distractors allowed her to quickly identify her pupils’ prior knowledge and misconceptions so that these could be addressed before they interfered with the new topic. She wanted pupils to justify their answers to the multiple-choice questions in order to better understand why some may have confused their thinking and to reassure herself that others’ correct answers were built on secure knowledge. Doing this in talk partners gave less-confident pupils the opportunity to check understanding in a low-stakes way and the teacher the chance to monitor this. As a result of this lesson, Seda was able to better organise future lessons. In this case, she decided to incorporate some quizzes and concept-matching starter activities throughout the lesson sequence to revise the Puritans’ basic beliefs and to help her give more tailored support for those who needed the content further broken down.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan: 10 mins\n\n#### Discuss with a colleague\n\nArrange to speak to an experienced colleague about how they use assessment in their practice.\n\nLook for connections between the outcomes from this discussion and the research summary above. Make notes as appropriate in your Learning Log, if you are using one.\n\nYou could ask them:\n\n- how they use formative assessment at the start of a topic to find out what pupils know already\n- how they use formative assessment during a topic to monitor pupils’ progression\n- how they use summative assessment at the end of a topic to make judgements about learning\n- the factors they consider when selecting a formative or summative assessment tool to use in their teaching\n\nIf you are not able to speak to a colleague with the required expertise, you can refer to the video resources that accompany this session.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 20 mins\n\n#### Practical exercise / independent planning\n\nSelect a lesson that you will be teaching soon. Look at the learning objectives (LOs) for this lesson and identify three different ways that you could assess pupils’ learning in relation to these LOs (for example: different types of questions, observation, quizzing, peer-assessment task, self-assessment task, marking work).\n\nUsing the concepts in this week’s Research and Practice Summary and other knowledge that you have in this area, reflect on each of your chosen three options by completing the table below. Put an * by the strategy that you think is the most effective strategy for this lesson, based on your assessment.

You will follow this up with your mentor in your next ECT mentor meeting.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Improving assessment in Year 4 science</h3>\nRobbie recently taught a series of lessons about the digestive system to his Year\n4 class and was really pleased with how things went. However, he was surprised when\nthe end-of-topic test revealed that pupils had not learnt what he wanted them to\nlearn – they had not understood core ideas about the digestive system. Over the topic,\npupils had done lots of writing and been really engaged in each lesson. Robbie had\nalso covered all of the content to be learnt, and pupils had been really enthusiastic\nduring class discussions and activities.\n\n<strong>\n  What could have misled Robbie about how well his pupils were learning? What\n  could he do to identify these issues sooner and adapt his teaching to improve\n  pupils’ learning?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nIn every lesson, teachers are gathering information about what their pupils know and can do and where misunderstandings or misconceptions lie. Teachers do this through the different forms of assessment that they use in the classroom. This diagnostic process is a vital part of formative assessment, in which teachers introduce, for example, effective classroom discussions that elicit evidence of learning.\n\nMaking a fair assessment of where pupils are in their learning is often complex, as teachers have to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as pupils appearing busy. Rob Coe has summarised some of the classroom behaviours and practices that may interfere with accurate assessments of pupils’ learning, which he terms Poor Proxies for Learning. These are activities which are easily observed but don’t necessarily signify learning (bear in mind that they are often not ‘negative’: they may contribute to a positive environment in which desired learning is more likely to occur, but they are not in themselves indicators of learning).\n\n1. students are busy: lots of work is done (especially written work)\n2. students are engaged, interested, motivated\n3. students are getting attention: feedback, explanations\n4. classroom is ordered, calm, under control\n5. curriculum has been ‘covered’ (i.e. presented to students in some form)\n6. (at least some) students have supplied correct answers (whether or not they really understood them or could reproduce them independently)\n\n$I\nRobbie was misled by his students completing lots of work and appearing engaged and enthusiastic. The challenge here is that these factors, although often supportive of learning, can also be observed where learning is not taking place – think, for example, about pupils who work hard to copy from a textbook or who write (or discuss) a lot without really engaging in ‘hard thinking’. Pupils may sit quietly and be highly engaged in watching an enjoyable video in a lesson, but the content of the video and how the teacher uses it will determine what and how much pupils learn.\n$I\n\nSometimes, a pupil can produce a ‘correct’ response to a question or task without knowing that they have done so, or without knowing how they did it. In other words, their underlying understanding may not be secure. To test this underlying understanding, it is important that teachers regularly prompt their pupils to elaborate upon their answers. Elaboration means explaining and describing ideas in greater detail. It may also involve making connections between the ideas pupils are trying to learn and their own experiences, prior knowledge and understanding, and day-to-day life.\n\nTo prompt pupils to elaborate further, you could say:\n\n- 'say it again in your own words’\n- ‘show me the steps you took to achieve that answer’\n- ‘prove to me that X is the wrong answer’\n- ‘give me two reasons why you think this is correct’\n- ‘explain it to someone who has a different answer’\n\nYou could also repeatedly ask ‘why?’ as a prompt to elaboration.\n\n$I\nRobbie noticed that his pupils were ‘enthusiastic’ during class discussions and made the inference that this meant they were learning. Instead of making this inaccurate inference, Robbie could have asked pupils to elaborate on the points they were contributing, using some of the prompts above. This would have given him more detailed data on pupils’ understanding, and he could then have adapted his teaching immediately to address any gaps in knowledge or pupil misconceptions.\n$I\n\n**Hinge questions** are a type of question that teachers use to learn more about pupils’ understanding. They are a useful way for teachers to formatively assess their pupils and pinpoint gaps in their knowledge. These are used at pivotal ‘hinge’ points in a lesson or sequence of lessons – often at the end of a phase of learning, when a teacher wants to check pupils’ conceptual understanding to determine whether, and in which direction, they are ready to move on. The teacher asks a hinge question to all pupils and uses their responses (perhaps on mini-whiteboards or using traffic-light cards) to determine the extent to which pupils have understood key concepts and whether any misconceptions are still present. Hinge questions often use a multiple-choice format - the teacher can structure the multiple-choice options to reflect different levels of understanding, including common misunderstandings.\n\nThe pupils’ responses to the hinge question should provide the teacher with valuable evidence about what their pupils know, don't know and need to do next. The teacher should be able to collect (view) and interpret responses from all pupils in less than 30 seconds - e.g. by glancing at each mini-whiteboard or traffic-light card. Teachers will then make adjustments to their teaching to respond to any misconceptions.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Developing a hinge question</h3>\nThis is Robbie’s first attempt at a hinge question:\n\n<strong>Everything made of metal is an electrical conductor</strong>\n\nA) True\n\nB) False\n\nAfter speaking with an experienced colleague, he rewrites his question so that each answer provides more useful information about pupils’ understanding:\n\n<strong>\n  Put these objects into three groups based on if they do, do not or maybe\n  conduct electricity\n</strong>\n<ol>\n  <li>A metal ruler</li>\n  <li>A plastic ruler</li>\n  <li>A shiny ruler</li>\n  <li>A ruler</li>\n  <li>A wooden ruler</li>\n  <li>A long ruler</li>\n</ol>\nThe second question is a better question because the answers that students give\n– both correct and incorrect – reveal something about their understanding to the\nteacher.\n\nFor the first question, pupils have a 50% chance of simply guessing correctly. The ‘wrong’ answer also reveals limited information about why pupils are incorrect. The answers to the second question could identify specific misconceptions – such as believing that because most metals are shiny, other shiny objects will also conduct electricity.\n$I\n\nWriting hinge questions takes careful preparation. To help you write a successful hinge question, consider these key characteristics as outlined by Dylan Wiliam:\n\n- it should not be easy to guess the correct answer\n- alternative answers should represent common misconceptions\n- more than one answer may be correct (AND, not OR)\n- pupils should not be able to arrive at the correct answer using incorrect reasoning\n- pupils should be able to respond to the question in no more than two minutes (ideally, less than a minute)\n\n**Misconceptions** typically occur when a pupil incorrectly applies prior knowledge to a new context, perhaps due to weaknesses in prior knowledge or because new ideas are introduced too quickly. For example, they might mis-remember a spelling rule, they might confuse definitions of important concepts or they might mis-apply a mathematical procedure by consistently leaving out an important step. Misconceptions can also arise from mis-hearing or mis-reading.\n\nOnce ‘learned’, misconceptions can become embedded in a pupil’s thinking and assumed to be true. As a teacher’s subject knowledge deepens, they learn to anticipate where these misconceptions commonly arise in their subject or phase. You were introduced to the idea of misconceptions in Module 2.\n\nTo help you anticipate and overcome misconceptions, you should:\n\n- discuss with experienced colleagues what the common misconceptions are for an area of study and the steps they take to help pupils master the important concepts in this area while avoiding common misconceptions\n- use assessments at the beginning of new topics to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions\n- structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions and by targeting areas that you know pupils typically find particularly tricky)\n- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that correct answers stem from secure understanding\n\n$I\n\n<h3>What did Robbie do next? Applying good assessment practice</h3>\nAfter learning more about good assessment, Robbie realised that he had been focusing\ntoo much on things that were not directly related to learning. During the next topic,\nelectricity, he made the following changes and was impressed with the improvements\nin pupils’ learning.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Before teaching the topic, Robbie made sure that he understood common\n    misconceptions about electricity by speaking to colleagues and researching\n    them online. He then analysed his class’s responses to five carefully\n    written diagnostic questions and used this to inform his planning – he\n    started with what his pupils knew, not what he hoped they knew.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Before teaching each lesson, Robbie thought carefully about how he would\n    efficiently check the understanding of all pupils – not just the pupils who\n    were keen to volunteer answers. He built in frequent activities throughout\n    the topic that generated whole-class responses, including quick quizzes,\n    multiple-choice questions and pupils showing their working on\n    mini-whiteboards. He was careful to avoid relying on ‘poor proxies for\n    learning’, instead targeting his planned assessments at the evidence that\n    would tell him how his pupils were achieving the lesson objectives.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    During each lesson, Robbie used the formative assessment techniques he had\n    prepared, including forensic follow-up questions, to make his teaching more\n    responsive to his pupils’ developing understanding. Where this identified\n    widespread misconceptions, he spent more time addressing these issues with\n    the whole class. Where particular pupils were struggling, he provided more\n    targeted support, including dynamically re-grouping his students (e.g.\n    pairing pupils who were less secure in their learning with peers who could\n    effectively support them).\n  </li>\n</ul>\nAfter this topic, Robbie created the following checklist to help him design questions\nto check pupils’ understanding in the future:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    what does it look like when pupils understand this concept accurately and\n    completely?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    what common misconceptions or knowledge gaps do pupils experience in\n    relation to this concept?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    what question will prompt pupils to show me their understanding/\n    misconceptions/knowledge gaps relating to this concept?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    how can I capture each misconception or knowledge gap as an option in the\n    list of possible answers?\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    is it possible to reach the correct answer with a process of incorrect\n    reasoning? (In which case, the question needs further work)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    what actions will I need to take to address each misconception or knowledge\n    gap in my pupils, if these are evident in pupils’ responses?\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBy following his new approach, Robbie is now much more aware of how his pupils are\nlearning – and is less distracted by potentially misleading factors. This means he\nis more able to adapt his teaching to his pupils’ needs and capabilities. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic.

This difficulty might be related to particular pupils, classes and/or lesson content. Use Rob Coe’s Poor Proxies for Learning, from the Research and Practice Summary above, to reflect on how these ‘proxies’ might be contributing to the difficulties you have in assessing the learning of these pupils.\n\nNow focus on two or three pupils whose learning you find it difficult to assess accurately. Ask yourself:\n\n1. What gets in the way of forming a clear picture of their learning?\n2. What forms of assessment might best clarify my understanding of what they know and can do?\n3. How might I introduce particular forms of assessment to develop a clearer picture of their learning?\n\nDraw on this week’s Research and Practice Summary to help you here.\n\n#### 2. Independent planning\n\nDrawing on your reflections (above) and this week’s Research and Practice Summary, develop a plan for how you might gather additional evidence of learning about each of these pupils. The plan may be different for each of the pupils (e.g. for a reluctant writer, it may involve more oral dialogue). You might find it helpful to consider both general strategies for each pupil and specific strategies that you will use in a particular lesson that you will be teaching soon.\n\nWrite your plan and any additional notes or questions in your Learning Log, if you are using one. Bring this to your next mentor meeting for further review.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nReview the outcomes of your thinking about how to apply assessment practice in the classroom to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear. Add to your Learning Log any additional notes, actions and/or questions arising from this session.\n\nBe ready to share these reflections and your independent planning on assessment with your mentor in your next meeting with them.\n\n", nil, "0b149c50-b739-401d-af4c-bdbb524d0049"],

In this self-study session, you will focus on what you do with this information, extending your knowledge about giving high-quality feedback.\n\nYou will explore how assessment information can be used to inform your decision making and the feedback pupils receive, as well as how they can use this feedback to move forward in their learning. With practice, pupils will increasingly be able to monitor and self-regulate their own learning through self-assessment. You will learn that the key to effective feedback is that it provides specific guidance, either verbal or written, that is clear and accurate, and that pupils are given the opportunity to act on it.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Giving high-quality feedback</h3>\nHelen and Aaron have been marking their Year 3 English books together and are really\npleased with how much their pupils have improved since September. They have been\ndiscussing how to make the most of feedback and realise that they disagree about\nsome key ideas. Helen believes the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>the more feedback you give pupils, the better</li>\n  <li>written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback</li>\n</ul>\nAaron disagrees. He says that Helen has developed some common misconceptions about\nfeedback.\n\n<strong>\n  What do you think? Who do you agree with? In your judgement, what is most\n  important about effective feedback?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Feedback** is information given to the pupil or teacher about the pupil’s performance relative to the intended learning. It is a key component of high-quality teaching and can dramatically affect learning, both positively and negatively. When giving feedback to pupils, it is important to get the details right – details both of what feedback is given and how it is given.\n\nLast week you learned about how to use approaches to assessment to gather useful information about your pupils’ understanding, including any misconceptions that they might hold. This data gathering is the first stage of high-quality assessment practice, as it provides feedback to the teacher. The impact on pupils’ learning depends on what is done next with this information:\n\n- first, the teacher needs to process the information that they collect: ask yourself ‘what does this tell me about pupils’ current understanding?’ and ‘who needs to take what action now to move pupils’ learning on?’\n- then, the teacher needs to take, or support pupils to take, the action identified. This might be adapting teaching so that it takes account of current pupil understanding (perhaps to address misconceptions or to build on sound existing understanding); it might also be to give feedback to pupils so that they can do something to improve their learning further\n\nThere are lots of ways to categorise approaches to giving high-quality feedback to pupils, including:\n\n- **what the feedback is about** – it can be about the person (e.g. how much effort was put into the work), products of learning (e.g. a piece of written or practical work) or about the learning process itself (e.g. how the pupil approached a task)\n- **who gives the feedback** – feedback can be provided by a teacher, peers, pupils themselves or using digital technology\n- **how the feedback is given** – it can be written, verbal, non-verbal (e.g. a nod of reinforcement, a physical gesture that models a practical activity)\n- **when the feedback is given** – feedback can be immediate or delayed\n- **how public the feedback is** – in busy classrooms, even one-to-one feedback can sometimes be picked up by other pupils: the message in the feedback should determine how public the feedback should be\n\nThere is no one ‘best’ approach to giving feedback. When providing any feedback, it is necessary to match it to your pupils’ characteristics and learning needs and to the nature of what is being learned. A quick verbal correction during a class discussion or a brief one-to-one chat while a pupil completes an extended activity are sometimes as powerful as detailed written comments in a pupil’s workbook. Messages of praise may be given publicly, whereas more challenging feedback may best be given privately and with the opportunity for pupils to clarify understanding in detail.\n\nUsing the categories above may help you to think more critically about the options available to you, and the choices you make, as you plan and teach lessons.\n\n$I\nHelen’s belief that ‘written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback’ is clearly incorrect. We could re-write this as ‘sometimes, written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback’. As so often in teaching, the choice the teacher makes in any given situation should draw on their understanding of critical features of the context to select a suitable approach for that situation.\n$I\n\nMore feedback is not necessarily better. Research syntheses, such as the Education Endowment Foundation’s Teaching and Learning Toolkit, suggest that feedback is most effective when it is used sparingly, for a number of reasons.\n\nToo much feedback, especially focusing on weaknesses, can be dispiriting.\n\nProviding excessive feedback can also cause cognitive overload, reducing pupils’ ability to process the feedback successfully. Even if pupils can process a lot of feedback at once, excessive volume can be overwhelming and confusing, meaning that pupils struggle to separate out, and take on board, key messages. Therefore, when giving feedback, you should consider what to prioritise and what may more helpfully be left out. It may be helpful to consider, ‘what is the best next step in learning?’\n\n$I\nHelen’s belief that ‘the more feedback you give, the better’ is also incorrect. Teachers who give too much feedback in one go may actually reduce the benefit that pupils get from it.\n$I\n\nTo ensure that your use of feedback contributes to pupils’ learning, you should:\n\n- **be accurate** – effective feedback needs to be based on an accurate assessment of pupils’ learning\n- **be clear** – consider how you can ensure pupils understand feedback received (verbal and non-verbal feedback in the moment is sometimes more powerful than written feedback after the event, for example; opportunities for clarification also help to ensure that pupils understand fully)\n- **be specific about what pupils should do** – focus on specific actions for the pupil (e.g. rather than saying ‘you need more detail here’, say ‘add a paragraph explaining how you reached this conclusion’ and provide pupils with suitable prompts to support them in doing this)\n- **encourage further effort** – recognise effort as well as attainment in the feedback you give (e.g. ‘I can see that you’ve worked hard to make this progress in your work. Keep going; you can do this’)\n- **develop self-regulation** – provide feedback on the process as well as the products of learning (e.g. ‘the plan that you wrote at the beginning really helped you to structure your writing clearly into strong paragraphs’). Self-regulation is also developed by teaching your pupils how to peer- and self-assess\n- **provide opportunities to act on feedback** – this requires allocating lesson time or incorporating it into home learning\n- **know your pupils** – tailor your language, feedback and tone to the characteristics of your specific pupils, while maintaining and demonstrating high expectations of all\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Improving feedback</h3>\nAaron and Helen shared some examples of feedback that they’d written for pupils recently\non some English homework. <strong>\n  Which do you think better exemplifies the characteristics of high-quality\n  feedback?\n</strong>\n\nHelen had written:\n\n<blockquote>\n  <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">\n    I like your story. It was exciting, and you used some good words. It would\n    be better if you used more adjectives.\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nAaron had written:\n<blockquote>\n  <span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">\n    Well done for working so carefully on this story. The way you used\n    adjectives like ‘exciting’ and ‘dramatic’ helped to add tension, as we\n    discussed in class. To improve this work further, you could use paragraphs\n    to organise your writing so that the reader can follow the story more\n    easily. You can do this during ‘review time’ on Thursday.{\" \"}\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nHelen’s feedback is too vague to be helpful and could further confuse her pupil.\nThey will not be clear from this feedback what ‘good’ words are, for example.\n\nAaron’s feedback is of higher quality as he is more specific than Helen, both in describing what is good about the work (with specific examples from the text) and how and when it can be further improved. This means the pupil should be better able to self-assess and improve their writing in the future.\n\nHowever, Aaron’s comment is also quite long and detailed, which could make it harder for his pupil to act on the feedback. It also assumes that the pupil knows how to use paragraphs appropriately. Aaron could restructure his comment to make it more likely that the pupil will get the most from it:\n\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">WWW: Exciting adjectives!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">\n  EBI: New time or place = NP.\n</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Task: Rewrite highlighted section in three paragraphs.</span></blockquote>\nIt might be helpful for Aaron to provide specific examples of exciting adjectives, but if he judges that the pupil clearly understands how to use them effectively, this might be unnecessary.\n$CTA\n\nIn week 1 of Module 4, you looked at formative and summative assessment. As part of formative assessment, peer-assessment and self-assessment can be valuable tools that enable pupils to monitor and improve their own progress against agreed success criteria. However, pupils first need to be trained in how to do this well, and the approaches work best alongside teacher assessment rather than as alternatives. Assessment can add significantly to a teacher’s workload, so it is important to become familiar with your school’s expectations and to learn from colleagues.\n\n**Peer-assessment** can positively affect achievement and improve self-regulation. When pupils assess each other’s work and give feedback, this is peer-assessment. Peer-assessment offers multiple benefits when structured and scaffolded appropriately, including:\n\n- helping pupils focus on the learning process, not simply the outcomes (which often happens with teacher assessment)\n- it can be very timely, compared to pupils waiting for written feedback from the teacher\n- pupils learn how to apply their critical process to their own work\n- it can reduce the teacher’s workload when done well\n\nPeer relationships may influence the effectiveness of peer-assessment. Teachers should be careful to ensure their pupils understand the success criteria for a task before expecting them to use the criteria to assess their peers.\n\n**Self-assessment** is when pupils work with their teachers to agree a set of success criteria against which they can assess their current performance. It is most useful when deployed formatively (while a task is ongoing). Self-assessment will be allied with a set of ‘targets-for-self’, steps the pupil sets themselves to improve upon their work. Self-assessment has similar benefits as peer-assessment and is a key element in formative assessment. It is good way of teaching pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Supporting pupils in monitoring and regulating their own learning</h3>\nHelen is pleased with the quality of her class’s writing so far. Now she wants them\nto do more to monitor and regulate their own learning. Specifically, she would like\nher pupils to edit their own writing for common errors, including basic punctuation.\n\nHelen decides that she can use peer-assessment to support this, especially as pupils are often reluctant to revise and edit their own work. Helen knows that effective peer-assessment takes careful planning so begins by modelling the process of self-editing for her class. She uses a visualiser and thinks aloud to share her thought processes as she assesses a short piece of writing that she created as a model. By doing this, Helen is further clarifying what good writing looks like (sharing success criteria) and supporting pupils to better understand how they can edit work themselves.\n\nNext, Helen provides structured opportunities for pupils to peer-assess each other’s work. As part of this, she helps her pupils to better understand how to give effective feedback, highlighting how to make this specific and helpful. She gives pupils a framework for feeding back on ‘two stars and a wish’, using sentence stems such as ‘a strength of your work is…’ and ‘one way to improve this is…’. Her pupils are now more able to accurately review each other’s work and provide appropriate feedback. As they practise peer-assessment, they become more confident and skilled in assessing the quality of writing. Finally, Helen supports her pupils in applying this new competence to their own writing.\n$I\n\nTo help you to improve the quality of peer- and self-assessment, you should:\n\n- share clear success criteria and revisit these before (and even during) the activity - ensure that pupils understand these criteria by, for example, asking them to express the criteria in their own words\n- scaffold activities by sharing models of good work (e.g. with a visualiser or interactive whiteboard) and identifying how their key features meet the success criteria\n- explain why you are teaching pupils to self-assess: this helps pupils focus on the processes behind their learning and not simply the outcomes (which can be the case when they are assessed by their teacher); self-assessment enhances metacognitive thinking\n- think carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer-assessment (e.g. by asking pupils to highlight a limited number of improvements to their partner’s work and to give clear examples of how to act on each improvement)\n- carefully match your pupils during peer-assessment to reduce tensions that can arise when pupils provide feedback to each other\n- explain to your pupils that there are benefits to giving feedback as well as receiving it - it can help the assessor to develop a better understanding of the most effective approaches to take to complete a task well\n- invite your pupils to feed back to each other on how it felt to be peer assessed (this can build mutual trust and cooperation)\n\n$I\n\n<h3>\n  Combining feedback approaches as part of a learning cycle in GCSE business\n</h3>\nAlessia has a clear structure to the feedback that she provides on substantial pieces\nof pupils’ work. She makes sure that her feedback covers the following, using the\nacronym SIT.\n\nStrengths: these are elements of the work that are good. Alessia highlights strengths throughout the text using yellow highlighter, then writes a summary at the end which helps pupils to understand why they are strengths. For example, ‘This is a strong evaluation because you are using key concepts (elasticity and demand) to justify why the business should take a particular action in this situation (reduce costs rather than raise prices).’\n\nImprovements: Alessia highlights one part of the text in green and writes guidance at the end of the work for pupils which tells them how and why this section needs improving. Pupils are expected to re-work this part of the text during dedicated classroom time. For example, ‘Improve your analysis in this paragraph by explaining the steps in your reasoning that link raising prices to falling overall revenue. Use connectives such as ‘this should lead to’ and ‘as a consequence’ to build your chain of reasoning.’ Alessia keeps the improvements focused and manageable so she doesn’t overwhelm pupils.\n\nTargets: Alessia identifies a target that each pupil should address in future work. For example, 'Extend lines of reasoning so that you always develop your arguments fully. Aim for at least 3 steps in each chain of analysis.’\n\nWhen pupils start their next substantial piece of work, Alessia asks them to write their previous target at the top of their work. When they have finished the task, pupils write a comment next to the target to self-assess the extent to which they have met it. They also circle the part of their work where they feel they have best demonstrated this target.\n\nThis approach builds clarity into Alessia’s feedback so that pupils understand how to improve. It combines short-cycle feedback (on the immediate task, which is addressed in the following lesson) and medium-cycle feedback (which looks forward to the next piece of work). Having pupils comment on how they have met their target also helps Alessia to judge the extent to which each pupil has understood her feedback and develops pupils’ self-regulation and ability to self-assess.\n$I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### Self-assessment\n\nNow use the ideas in the Research and Practice Summary to reflect in greater depth on your own feedback practice in relation to how you give feedback.\n\nYou might ask yourself:\n\n- how accurate and clear is my feedback typically?\n- to what extent does my feedback encourage further effort from pupils?\n- is my feedback specific enough for pupils to improve?\n- what opportunities do I generally give pupils to act on feedback?\n- how does my feedback support pupils to increasingly monitor and regulate their own learning?\n\n### Theory to Practice: 25 mins\n\nYou have a range of activities to engage with this week. Choose one or two of these activities that are most suited to your teaching context and learning needs.\n\n#### 1. Analyse artefacts / reflect\n\nCollect a few samples of written feedback that you have given recently. If you do not give written feedback often in your phase/specialism, briefly note the details of some verbal feedback that you have given recently. Review these samples of your own feedback on pupils’ work and note where they reflect characteristics of high-quality feedback.\n\n1. Connect these characteristics to the Research and Practice Summary for this session and to the guide questions in the previous activity. Where can you see opportunities to further improve your feedback?\n2. Having analysed some physical examples of your own feedback, consider how accurate you were in your reflections on feedback practice in the Review activity. Do you want to modify your self-assessment now that you have looked as samples of your feedback? What does this tell you about reflecting on and self-assessing your own practice, if anything?\n\n#### 2. Discuss with pupils\n\nIf possible, arrange to **talk to a few pupils** in your school about their views on feedback. They don’t have to be pupils that you teach.\n\nYou might explore:\n\n- how they understand the purpose of feedback\n- whether they prefer verbal or written feedback and why\n- what kind of action they typically take in response to feedback received\n- what they think the relationship is between receiving feedback and their learning\n\n#### 3. Discuss with a colleague\n\nTalk to a colleague about realistic expectations for how independent and self-regulating pupils should be when they enter/leave each age range/phase/year in your setting. Reflect on your own expectations to date of pupils and how you might adjust these in light of your conversation, if at all.\n\nMake notes in your Learning Log, if you are using one, about what you have learned from the previous activities. Note how you will draw on this learning to further improve the impact of your own practice in relation to giving verbal and written feedback.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nWhile teaching during the coming week, make a point of connecting learning from this session to your practice by:\n\n- reflecting on the sort of feedback you give to your pupils and how this relates to the characteristics of high-quality feedback that you have learned about\n- focusing on how you create opportunities for pupils to act on your feedback\n- noticing specifically the impact this seems to have on their learning\n\nWrite a reminder to yourself to capture key learning from this activity in your Learning Log, if you are using one.\n\nBe ready to share this and your other learning from this session with your mentor in your next meeting with them.\n\n", nil, "64b8e81b-bdff-4d48-8112-4dceca58e228"],

It was clear to Sara where she needed to focus her teaching in the next\nlesson to address pupils’ learning needs, but she was just too tired to get started\non planning this now. The lesson would have to wait.\n\n<strong>\n  What could Sara have done differently in this situation? How could she make\n  more efficient use of her time to assess pupils’ work, respond to this in her\n  teaching and give pupils feedback?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n**Efficiency** can be thought of as ‘the reduction of waste’. The most common resource wasted in teaching is time, leading to an overall increase in teachers’ workloads and negatively impacting learning. Reducing wasted time is a key priority for teachers and school leaders.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of efficiency as the relationship between time taken and quality of outcome (i.e. ‘value for money’), because it doesn’t always follow that reducing time spent on an activity is a good thing per se. Teaching is intellectual labour, and some parts of a teacher’s work legitimately take time because they are hard to do well. For example, when planning to introduce a new, foundational concept, rushing the planning of a lesson may mean that pupils do not learn that concept securely, affecting many future lessons.\n\nSchools and multi-academy trusts develop their own policies and practices around assessment, marking and feedback. They are encouraged to be mindful of the impact on teacher workload of assessment practices, especially around written marking on individual pieces of work, which can be onerous. You need to be aware of your school’s expectations of marking; you should also seek ways of minimising the potentially negative impacts of marking to excess. Time invested in marking and giving feedback must be used efficiently in order to make the most of the limited resource that you have. Self-assessment and peer-assessment both have pedagogical benefits and can help reduce marking workload for teachers, too.\n\nTo help you save time without significantly impacting the quality of outcomes, you could make marking manageable and effective by:\n\n- recording data only when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes\n- working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback (e.g. using whole class feedback or well supported peer- and self-assessment)\n- using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons, where possible\n- understanding that written marking is only one form of feedback (other forms include verbal feedback, peer- and self-assessment)\n- reducing the opportunity cost of marking (e.g. by using abbreviations and codes in written feedback)\n\nAn important strategy for maximising efficiency when marking is to prioritise the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather than careless mistakes.\n\nMistakes are usually accidental – the pupil could identify and self-correct the mistake if prompted to. Errors can be more serious for learning because they arise from a lack of knowledge or misunderstanding. Although it can be tempting to point out to pupils the full range of mistakes across a task, this has two potentially negative consequences - the time it takes you to mark and the chance of overwhelming pupils with comments across their work. Aim to focus feedback on errors relating to the core concepts of the lesson. To reinforce the importance of good literacy across all subjects, you might correct the first three mistakes of general spelling, punctuation and grammar in a piece of work, then focus only on errors related to misunderstandings in the rest of the task. A general prompt to proof-read work carefully might be useful if careless mistakes are a common occurrence, but the focus of your feedback time can then be dedicated to securing and deepening pupils’ understanding of the concepts most central to their learning.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3\n  class=\"rich-text block-editor-rich-text__editable\"\n  role=\"textbox\"\n  contenteditable=\"true\"\n  aria-multiline=\"true\"\n  aria-label=\"Write heading…\"\n>\n  Using codes to improve Sara’s approach to marking\n</h3>\nWhat could Sara do differently in the situation described above? Rather than spend\ntime repeatedly writing individual comments in pupils’ books, Sara could note the\ncommon comments across her pupils’ work and capture these as a set of codes. In the\nsame way that ‘SPaG’ is often used as a code to indicate the need to address Spelling,\nPunctuation or Grammar, other codes can be used to represent common subject- or phase-specific\ncomments. Marking each piece of work then becomes a case of noting the codes on each\npupil’s work, saving the teacher many minutes or hours. This time can then be used\nto plan lesson activities that support pupils to understand and act on what the codes\nin their work mean.\n\n<strong>Using codes in your teaching:</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      what comments do you often find yourself making on your pupils’ work?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      can you group these comments into categories that are helpful for making\n      sense of the type of feedback being given? For example, presentation (e.g.\n      underlining titles, writing clearly), subject-specific assessment criteria\n      (e.g. English AO2 – effect on reader), conventions of the subject (e.g.\n      describing scientific experiments, drawing graphs, safe use of equipment)\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>\n      what codes would usefully capture these comments for your pupils in your\n      context, relevant to your specialism?\n    </strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$CTA\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices that you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 min\n\nAs explained in the Research and Practice Summary, ‘efficiency’ refers to the reduction of waste. You can think of efficiency as having two key aspects in relation to assessment: time taken and impact on learning. The more efficient an approach is, the more impactful the time taken is for pupil learning. In relation to marking and feedback, ‘waste’ could relate to each of the factors in the table below. The table includes ways to improve efficiency, in each case:\n\n| Factor affecting overall efficiency** **                                                     | **Improving efficiency **                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| The amount of time teachers spend assessing pupils’ work and providing feedback.                 | Ask pupils to hand in workbooks open at the page to be marked to save time when marking a set of books.Reduce time spent assessing pupils’ work and writing feedback by, for example, using codes or abbreviations to reference common actions/comments on work or giving verbal instead of written feedback.Give feedback to pupils in small groups or as a class rather than individually.Engage pupils in peer-assessment and/or self-assessment, where appropriate. |\n| The amount of time pupils take to make sense of, engage with and respond to feedback.            | Improve clarity and/or organisation of feedback so it clearly highlights guidance on how to improve and encourages further effort.Reduce the volume of feedback given to avoid the chance of ‘the signal being lost in the noise’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The time lag between pupils completing a task and receiving feedback.                            | Give feedback during lessons where possible, or as soon after the task is completed as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| The consistency of messaging to pupils about what constitutes high-quality work and/or progress. | Be clear about success criteria before pupils begin working.

Practical exercise\n\nIdentify two contrasting occasions on which you have given feedback to your pupils over the last half term. Write brief notes that describe each occasion. There are two examples shown below - your statements will differ according to the phase and specialism in which you are teaching:\n\n$I\nDuring a practical lesson in the workshop, I circulated around the room as pupils worked on cutting their wood pieces. I gave verbal feedback to each pupil as I observed their work. The main topics of feedback were health and safety, how well they were using tools, the quality of techniques used and reminding them of the objectives of the task.\n$I\n\n$I\nThe end of term assessment was a written test. I collected pupils’ books (already open at the page I needed to mark). I annotated each answer to highlight strengths and mistakes and then wrote a summative paragraph at the end of each test with the overall mark. I put a star by the question that pupils should focus on during improvement time. I gave back the books in the following lesson, and pupils had half an hour to read my feedback, re-draft the starred question and then do independent study to improve their knowledge of any topics that they didn’t get full marks on in the test.\n$I\n\n#### 2. Reflection / self-assessment\n\nNow, evaluate these two occasions with a specific focus on how efficient the process was on each occasion. Use the details in the table above to help you think about the time taken and the impact on learning on each occasion.\n\nAs you reflect, you could ask yourself:\n\n- ‘how and why did I decide which forms of feedback were most appropriate in different situations?’\n- ‘what impact did these choices have on me in terms of the time taken to assess my pupils and give the feedback?’\n- ‘what impact did these choices have on my pupils in terms of the time taken to engage with, and act on, the feedback?’\n- ‘what impact did these choices have on the quality of learning for my pupils?’\n\nBased on this activity, identify two key strengths in your approach to efficient assessment. Identify two actions that you will take going forward to make your approach to assessment even more efficient. Note these in your Learning Log, if you are using one.\n\n#### 3. Discuss with a colleague\n\nNow that you have thought about efficiency in your own assessment practice, have a short discussion with a colleague about the strategies they use to make their assessment practice as efficient as possible.\n\nAdd to the notes in your Learning Log, if you are using one, any ideas that you gain from this discussion.\n\nTo help structure this discussion, you could ask:\n\n- ‘what strategies do you use to minimise the burden of assessment in your teaching?’\n- ‘what do you see as the strengths and challenges of these approaches?’\n\nIf you are not able to speak to a colleague with the required expertise, you can refer to the video resource that accompanies this session.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBe ready to share your reflections from this session and any notes that you have made in your Learning Log with your mentor in your next meeting with them. You will work with your mentor to continue to explore efficient approaches to assessment.\n\n", nil, "16486adb-c11f-4446-a74d-a6aa4e0764a7"],

This has been expanded through subsequent sessions in the module. In this week’s self-directed study session, you have the opportunity to revisit your thinking around professional development and to explore opportunities to continue to develop yourself over time.\n\n## Research and Practice Summary\n\nThis reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions on how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Improving Harry’s questioning</h3>\nHarry is a very effective teacher who works hard to keep improving. His pupils are\ndoing well and enjoy their English lessons, and Harry’s colleagues recognise the\nexcellent work he is doing.\n\nFollowing a series of peer observations with colleagues, Harry has decided that he wants to further develop his use of questioning.\n\n<strong>\n  What should Harry think about when planning relevant professional development?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\nDuring the early years of your career, you can make rapid progress in your development as a teacher through effective professional development. Not all professional development is equally powerful, though – the types of professional development and how you engage with it make all the difference.\n\nOverall, there is limited evidence that directly tests different forms of professional development. However, there are a number of important features that researchers think are associated with effective professional development.\n\nKey features of effective professional development include:\n\n- **focus** – having a specific focus on something that is likely to improve pupil outcomes is a central feature of effective professional development. If professional development is too broad or focuses on things unlikely to benefit pupils, then it is unlikely to be effective at improving teaching overall\n- **collaboration and expert challenge** – working with colleagues, particularly with relevant expertise, can make professional development more motivating. Colleagues can also provide support and challenge to help you develop, both informally and through a more formalised coaching relationship\n- **sustained** – one-off professional development tends not to be very effective. Most changes to how you teach require sustained focus and effort. This is especially important for changing habits, such as how you get a class to pay attention\n- **practice** – there is often a big gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’. Practice, sustained over time, can help you to embed habits and routines so that you can move from simply knowing about an aspect of effective teaching to using it regularly and purposefully\n\nAs you have already learnt, reflection is an important part of developing as a professional. It can help you to identify progress made, recognise strengths and weaknesses, and identify next steps in your continued improvement.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that your judgement alone can be fallible, but you can complement your reflections with information from other sources. Combining these sources of information with your professional judgement gives you the best chance of developing as a teacher.\n\nOther sources of information to guide your professional development:\n\n- **research evidence** – using high-quality research evidence can guide you towards ‘best bets’ which are most likely to improve learning. This includes focusing your effort where it is most likely to matter, working out how to use your energy most effectively and avoiding fads that are not supported by evidence. When using evidence, it is crucial to remember two guiding questions: ‘is this evidence credible?’ and ‘is this evidence applicable to my own context?’\n- **feedback from colleagues** – colleagues can bring a fresh perspective and may have specialist knowledge that can help you to improve. Seeking their constructive challenge, feedback and critique can help you to improve\n- **pupil data and views** – ultimately, effective teacher professional development is about improving pupil outcomes. Therefore, it is important to use information about pupils, including their views, to inform your reflections. However, it is important to be mindful of the limitations of the data you are using and to exercise professional judgement in interpreting this data, as you would in all cases\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Harry’s professional development</h3>\nHarry knows that effective questioning can fulfil many different purposes, including\nchecking pupils’ prior knowledge. Therefore, questioning is a powerful way of supporting\npupils’ learning. Harry also knows about some of the things that research evidence\nsuggests can improve questioning, including:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to ensure that correct answers\n    stem from a secure understanding\n  </li>\n  <li>allowing sufficient thinking time after posing questions</li>\n  <li>\n    targeting a range of pupils to answer questions, rather than relying on\n    volunteers to respond to provide a better overview of the understanding of\n    all pupils in a group\n  </li>\n</ul>\nDespite knowing these things, Harry routinely finds that he does not do them consistently,\ninstead reverting to old habits in the midst of classroom activity – this is the\ngap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’. These ‘old habits’ are well-embedded, and it will\nrequire sustained effort to improve Harry’s approaches to questioning. To achieve\nthis, Harry decides to focus on the three areas identified and to make this a sustained\nfocus of his professional development. He actively plans lots of opportunities to\npractise, sometimes scripting out key questions or interactions in advance of a lesson.\nHe also works with colleagues who provide advice about refining his questioning techniques,\nand he arranges to have some coaching and feedback over a 6-week period from an expert\ncolleague. Harry’s coach provides ongoing support and challenge around his goal of\nimproving his questioning. Harry finds that this sustained focus on the 3 areas he’s\nidentified over a period of time really helps him to embed improved approaches to\nquestioning in his practice. $I\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 10 mins\n\nRead the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. the practices you are already doing well\n2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently\n3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet\n\nAs you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.\n\n### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins\n\n#### 1. Reflection\n\nNow repeat the activity in step 1 but with reference to other professional development activities that you have engaged with this year. These could include:\n\n- in-school activities such as weekly teaching and learning updates\n- external activities supported by your school, such as attendance at exam board training\n- activities you have undertaken in your own time, such as reading relevant literature or attending a weekend conference\n\n#### 2. Practical exercise\n\nDrawing on the Research and Practice Summary for this week, and on your own knowledge and experience of teacher professional development, sketch out a ‘menu’ of professional development opportunities that you think are relevant and useful to teachers in your phase and specialism. You will work further on this exercise in your next mentor meeting.\n\nAs you draft your notes, consider:\n\n- any costs associated with the opportunity (include time and monetary costs)\n- how the opportunity meets the criteria for effective professional development\n- how relevant the opportunity is for teachers in your phase and specialism\n- how easily accessible the opportunity is\n- why you think this is good professional development – how is it expected to improve your professional practice?\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your draft ‘menu’ of professional development opportunities to your next mentor meeting.

Last week, at the annual conference, you examined the principles of practitioner inquiry, learning how to form an exploratory question, which examines the impact upon pupils of your normal practice (ECF Standard 8a); and how to collect evidence about your practice (ECF Standard 8d). By the end of the conference you should, with your mentor, have agreed what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence about what impact your normal practice has on your pupils now.\n\nThis week, in advance of your mentor meeting, you should use your self-study time to define what your normal practice is like in this area and collect evidence of the impact of your practice upon your pupils.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>\nSchools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries, first of all,\nmake use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’\nwork and the ECT’s assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils\nand what the ECT has heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection,\nin the main, we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they\nare saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you\ndo this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a\nfew pupils for five minutes at the start of break time, or you might share lunch\nwith a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class.\n$I\n\n## Case Studies\n\nThese case studies explore how two teachers developed their own teaching and conducted their own practitioner inquiries into setting high expectations and managing behaviour effectively. Both are interesting but you should focus on the one most closely related to the exploratory question you are working on. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice and how they used the research embedded in the ECF to decide how to introduce an alteration to the way they taught.\n\n**When studying these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Setting high expectations</h3>\nSam, a Year 5 teacher, believes that he is good at forming positive relationships\nwith his class. He has a proactive approach to behaviour management, and he encourages\nhis pupils to work hard through the use of praise and reward points. As a result,\nSam doesn’t have many problems with behaviour, and his pupils say they enjoy his\nlessons. However, progress data indicate that a number of pupils in Sam’s class (including\nlower and higher prior attaining pupils) are not achieving age-related expectations\nin maths. To investigate this further, Sam decided to develop his teaching in this\narea and to undertake a practitioner inquiry.\n\nFollowing a discussion with his Head of Year (who advised him on which pupils to concentrate on), he decided to undertake some pupil voice work, to see what his pupils thought about his normal practice and how far they agreed that the expectations he had of them were challenging.\n\nSam wrote an initial, exploratory question:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  What do Year 5 pupils say, think and feel about the work they are set in\n  maths?\n</p>\nTo answer this question, Sam decided to give his class a short survey, which consisted\nof hands-up/ hands-down responses to 5 questions; this took just 2 minutes at the\nend of a lesson. He then interviewed a small, representative sample of pupils in\n3 focus groups of 3. He did this during 5 minutes of morning break, on three mornings\nof one week. The data Sam collected suggested the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    pupils like receiving praise and encouragement when they feel they deserve\n    it\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    sometimes, pupils feel the work is too easy, or that they have ‘done it\n    before’\n  </li>\n  <li>sometimes pupils don’t understand the expectations Sam has of them</li>\n  <li>\n    sometimes, pupils don’t understand how they are supposed to respond to the\n    feedback Sam gives them about how to push their learning on to the next\n    level\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  What alteration to his teaching might Sam make to improve the levels of\n  challenge, support and feedback he provides for pupils?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### A multifaceted approach to setting high expectations\n\nReflecting on the data he had collected, Sam looked again at the research on high expectations in the Early Career Framework – particularly 1a to 1d – to help him plan an intervention based around setting high expectations. He realised that setting high expectations is a complex process, with many moving parts. Sam therefore decided to create a multifaceted ‘high expectations plan’, comprising the following elements:\n\n- set pupils a short weekly quiz to determine their current level of knowledge and understanding; he made sure that this was non-threatening so that the pupils were supported by a positive environment and recognised that they could learn from their mistakes (1c)\n- write explicit, descriptive success criteria for each maths lesson and refer to these success criteria intentionally and consistently in lessons – this was so the pupils would understand the challenge he was setting them and how to achieve it (1b)\n- he wanted to model for them how pupils like them might respond to a classroom environment where the expectations were high – he invented a fictional pupil, ‘risk-taking Sam’, but told them that Sam was based on himself; he did this to a) model what it looks like to take risks and push yourself out of your comfort zone; b) model common mistakes and misconceptions made by pupils in the class; c) help pupils anticipate common misconceptions and identify solutions before they arise; and d) create an environment where risk-taking and mistake-making are embraced as a part of the learning process – he hoped in this way to influence the attitudes of his pupils (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1a)\n- contact the parents and carers of three pupils each week to celebrate success where pupils have reached or exceeded expectations in maths (1d)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Managing behaviour effectively</h3>\nMeera knows that behaviour in her Year 8 classes needs to improve. Each week, she\nspends several hours setting, running and chasing up detentions. Often, these detentions\ninvolve the same pupils each week. Because she has to spend time in lessons dealing\nwith low-level disruption, this has a detrimental impact on Meera’s ability to teach\neffectively, and on the progress of pupils in her classes. To improve her practice\nwith regard to managing behaviour effectively, Meera decided to undertake a practitioner\ninquiry. Knowing that many of her colleagues have excellent behaviour-management\nskills, Meera wrote the following, exploratory question:\n\nHow do high-performing teachers normally establish a positive climate for learning at School X?\n\nMeera’s school encourages teachers to observe each other informally, and her inquiry coincided with an ‘observe-to-learn fortnight’, which made it easy for her to arrange to observe three colleagues, teaching similar classes to her own—one from within her own department and two from other departments. She followed their advice to come in just for the first 10 minutes of their lessons when they were reinforcing routines. Meera was pleasantly surprised and encouraged to see the pupils she found challenging working diligently in other lessons. She noticed that the teachers had little poor behaviour to react to: they had already done the hard work when they had set up their routines. The observations helped her to understand that teachers, by being good role models themselves, can affect the motivation and behaviour of their pupils. (1.1, 1.2)\n\nWhen Meera spoke to the teachers together one lunchtime, they gave her their top tips. She also read again her Learning Log notes for Module 1, where she had recorded her insights into demonstrating high expectations of behaviour. From these chats, and from her reading, Meera collated the following insights:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    that it’s best, where possible, to establish routines at the beginning of\n    the year, but it is more important to keep practising them – reinforcing\n    positives; for example, by highlighting the behaviours she wants to see more\n    of (7i)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    pupils with SEND especially – but all pupils really – respond best when they\n    know clearly what the teacher’s expectations are. Meera decided she would\n    always praise effort, always praise when a pupil reacted well to making a\n    mistake, always correct a pupil if they spoke out of turn (7.2, 1h)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    it is useful to use rewards and sanctions consistently and predictably (1g);\n    however, this should not be the sole method of behaviour management as it is\n    ‘after the fact’\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    it is important to have high expectations with regard to behaviour and to\n    stick to them rigorously (1f)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    it is important to give pupils manageable, specific and sequential\n    instructions – short routines – to make expectations really clear and to\n    minimise misbehaviour caused by confusion (7c)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    it is a good idea to use consistent language and non-verbal signals for\n    common classroom directions (7e)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    when dealing with low-level disruption, it is important to use minimally\n    invasive interventions in the first instance, to avoid escalating conflict\n    and to give pupils the opportunity to respond (7f)\n  </li>\n</ul>\nMeera also analysed the behaviour data relating to her classes and noticed a pattern\nthat most of the pupils she regularly sets detentions for are boys who speak English\nas an Additional Language (EAL) in Year 8.\n\n<strong>\n  What alterations to her practice might Meera begin to try to improve the\n  behaviour of pupils in her lessons?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### A multifaceted approach to managing behaviour effectively\n\nAfter she had pulled together all her evidence, Meera identified a number of strategies she wanted to try in order to improve behaviour in her Year 8 lessons, centred around memorable behaviour routines:\n\n- Create a set of short, positively worded, three-step routines to make clear her expectations with regard to pupils’ behaviour in each part of a lesson (7h) – for example:\n\n  - entering the room – enter in silence, planner on desk, start the ‘do now’ task\n  - when the teacher is talking – hands empty, perfect silence, eyes on me\n  - during class discussions – take turns, give reasons, track the speaker\n  - during independent work – collect resources, check understanding, work in silence\n  - at the end of the lesson – chair under desk, stand behind chair, wait to be dismissed\n\n- create visual reminders of the above and non-verbal signals to help pupils understand behaviour expectations for each part of a lesson (7e)\n\n- deliberately practise the routines until the pupils can do them without thinking (7i), and mention the routines regularly using clear, consistent language and non-verbal signals – for example, her hand up means she is waiting for quiet (7j)\n\n- make sure all pupils understand her expectations with regard to behaviour (as well as tasks) in each part of a lesson, especially those pupils who receive detentions most frequently – she would nominate a pupil to repeat back an instruction if she suspected the class were confused (7c)\n\n- reinforce these routines and expectations through the consistent and predictable use of rewards and sanctions (e.g. not allowing pupils to speak while the teacher is speaking) (7a)\n\n- because she often found herself at a loss for what to say in the heat of the moment, she would use scripted responses when responding to incidents of low-level disruption, to avoid escalation and to give pupils time to respond – for example, she made a habit of always referring off-task pupils back to the learning intentions of the lesson (7f)\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 5 mins\n\nRead the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation\n2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you\n3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### Action planning\n\nAt the conference, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.\n\nPlan out how you are going to do that; for example:\n\n- If you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, from whom will you collect it, and when will you do it? Will you be able to collect it during a lesson?\n- If you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be, and when will they observe you? Are there more time-efficient ways of doing this – for example, if they could observe you for 10 minutes, which 10 minutes should they watch?\n\nRemember, this is a very short inquiry, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect are valid for your inquiry (i.e. that they offer evidence to help you answer your question).\n\n### Theory to Practice: 40 mins\n\nHow you collect your evidence will depend upon the area of practice you are developing. However, it is likely to include the following:\n\n#### 1. Analyse artefact and reflection\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘What do my pupil data say about the progress of high prior attaining girls?’\n- ‘Which parents are more likely to engage in their child’s learning?’\n- ‘In what conditions do my pupils behave well so that they can learn productively?’\n\nData for all of this will be near to hand; you won’t need to look hard to find these data.\n\nSchools retain data on all sorts of aspects pertaining to the behaviour of pupils and how they respond to the culture of expectations around them. Your data management system will store much of this; administrative staff may help you access data on attendance and punctuality; other colleagues, including pastoral staff and specialists such as the SENCO, can tell you about previous behaviour patterns, levels of parental engagement and support the pupils have received in the past.\n\nWhen collecting these sorts of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:\n\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |\n| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – are they still true now? For example, is a pupil’s past behaviour record reliable evidence of their behaviour patterns now?                                                                                           |\n| Manageability | For a short inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Look first for the naturally occurring data: those which are available to you as a normal part of your job.                                                                       |\n\nMeera looked at the behaviour data on the school’s system relating to all her classes but noticed that most problems were occurring in her Year 8; hence, she decided to look further only at those data. By doing so, she noticed a pattern that most of the pupils she regularly set detentions for were boys who speak English as an Additional Language (EAL).\n\n#### 2. Discuss with pupils\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘What do my pupils say about the expectations I have of them about the quality of their work?’\n- ‘When are my pupils more likely to respond positively when faced with challenging problems?’\n- ‘In what conditions do my pupils behave well so that they can learn productively?’\n\nWhen collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. When can you collect pupil voice data? Can you do it in your lesson by a show of hands, or by speaking to a small group for 3 minutes while their classmates get on with independent learning? Do you need 5 minutes of a break time? Don't use up more of your – or their – time than is strictly necessary. |\n\nSam decided to give his class a short, hand-up survey. Because he wanted to be sure he understood those findings and could rely on them, he then interviewed a small, representative sample of pupils in focus groups over three morning breaks.\n\n#### 3. Self-assessment\n\nIn preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about your normal practice. This does not have to be definitive: it just describes what you think the evidence is saying about your practice now.\n\ne.g.,\n\nSam, in Case Study A, said:\n\n> ‘The feedback from my pupil survey seems to indicate that my pupils like me, and they feel safe in my classroom. However, some of my pupils also feel that I let them get away with producing work of a lower standard than I should. One lower-attaining pupil said that I seemed to be satisfied if he just “made an attempt”. Other evidence – from the last pupil progress meeting – also showed that my higher-attaining pupils’ work is not yet at the same level as similar pupils in the other class. The pupil survey suggested that my higher-attaining pupils would like me to model for them with more clarity what a high-quality outcome might look like for them. Overall, I need to have higher expectations of my pupils and make those explicit for them.’\n\nMeera, in Case Study B, said:\n\n> ‘I am exhausted after every lesson with this class because I am struggling to manage their behaviour effectively. I had the impression that every pupil was misbehaving but, of course, that wasn’t true. Our data management system tracks the behaviour points and merits for all pupils. I realised that my difficulties were mainly in Year 8. I noticed that, for this class, 90% of the behaviour points I was logging was for boys, often boys with EAL. Also, other teachers were not logging so many behaviour points for the same boys. This seems to suggest that there are things I could do to more effectively manage their behaviour, which would help the whole class.’\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this with your mentor. In that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.\n\n", nil, "0c7fdc8c-0636-415d-8e6a-e4bf828db5be"],

You also constructed with them an exploratory inquiry question, which will help you focus your development across this module. Last week, in your ECT Training session, you looked again at the nature of school-based evidence and discussed issues of ‘sufficiency’ and ‘validity’.\n\nNext week, you have another mentor meeting. To prepare for that, you should use your self-study time to define what your normal practice is like in your focus area and to collect evidence of the impact of your practice upon your pupils. It is helpful for any teacher to get into habits of monitoring your practice, reviewing its impact and implementing useful changes.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>\nSchools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make\nuse of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’\nwork—and the ECT’s assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils—and\nwhat the ECT has heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in\nthe main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are\nsaying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do\nthis looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few\npupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with\na colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I\n\n## Case Studies\n\nThese case studies explore how two teachers—improving their practice and without adding to their workload—conducted their own practitioner inquiries into promoting good progress and demonstrating good subject and curriculum knowledge. Both are interesting, but you should focus on the one most closely related to the development area you are working on and your exploratory question. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice, and how they decided to introduce an alteration to the way they taught.\n\n**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Embedding retrieval, practice and challenge</h3>\nYemi is a chemistry specialist teaching a Year 10 class who are motivated and able\nto work independently. She notices that some students are able to finish sets of\nproblems involving drawing the atomic structure of an element quickly and accurately,\nwhilst others need support and are often left behind. She also feels that they are\nnot able to then apply this knowledge in thinking about which elements are more reactive.\nShe talks to a colleague who she shares this class with, and they suspect that recall\nof key points about atomic structure and the periodic table might be at play here.\n\nThey decide they need to develop their practice in this area so come up with an exploratory inquiry question together:\n\n<blockquote>\n  To what extent do we give pupils opportunities to recall key knowledge about\n  atomic structure and the periodic table?\n</blockquote>\nThe two teachers decide to work together to investigate this. In one lesson, they\nask pupils to try to answer a set of problems which ask them to draw the atomic structure\nof a few elements and to then explain how reactive they are. They do not provide\nany resources for this and explain to the pupils that they are setting a very challenging\ntask and that pupils should try and identify where they struggle if they can. In\nthe next lesson, the other teacher gives them a similar set of problems but makes\nthis ‘open book’, allowing them to draw on a textbook to help, but asking them to\nnote down what they have to look up.  From considering their exercise books and talking\nto the pupils afterwards, they find that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    pupils need to recall the basic facts of the structure of atomic shells\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    pupils who answer questions quickly already know ‘rules’ about which groups\n    in the periodic table are more reactive\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    pupils who complete questions are able to relate their knowledge of atomic\n    structure to their knowledge about reactivity\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Conclusion: all pupils need to know the ‘rules’ about which groups in the\n    periodic table are more reactive before they can answer questions with a\n    high degree of success, or apply this knowledge to other problems; they\n    realise that this is probably always true about the importance of core\n    knowledge (3.5)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  What alteration to her teaching might Yemi make to improve her pupils’ recall\n  of key concepts so they can apply their knowledge quickly and reliably to\n  other situations?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### Yemi’s approach to embedding retrieval, practice and challenge\n\nYemi and her colleague look at the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 2, in particular those covering ECF 2h, 2i, 2j and 2k; they realise that they need to build in retrieval practice as well as increasing the challenge of the exercises over time, and they decide to plan three revision activities, which they will spread over the next three lessons (whilst still teaching other content)—in them, they will:\n\n- repeat questions which ask pupils to recall the structure of atomic shells, and practise drawing structures (2i)\n- as their recall becomes more secure, ask pupils to make predictions about reactivity based on which group and element is in the periodic table, and based on the atomic structure (2j)\n- increase the complexity of the task, by challenging the pupils to consider reactions that occur between different (ionic) elements (2k)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Supporting a class with reading comprehension</h3>\nKishan is a Year 3 teacher in an inner-city school, and is pleased with how his class\nare developing fluency with reading. Having learned about this during his ITT year,\nand in Module 2 of his ECF year 1, Kishan has promoted reading for pleasure by reading\naloud with his class and using a range of different texts and genres including fairy\ntales, poetry, fiction and some non-fiction. However, he notices that they sometimes\nstruggle to comprehend and discuss the feelings and thoughts that characters might\nhave and to draw on the texts to understand the motives involved. This becomes clear\nin his whole-class questioning and pupil written work around comprehension. Following\na discussion with another Year 3 teacher, Kishan decides to consider the details\nof which texts they struggle with and which they find easy to comprehend or think\ncritically about.\n\nHe drafts an exploratory inquiry question:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Under what conditions are pupils more likely to be able to comprehend the\n  motivations of characters in a range of texts?\n</blockquote>\nTo answer this question, Kishan and his colleague decide to review a sample of pupil\nwork on reading comprehension and see if there was any relation to the types of texts\nbeing read. What they find suggests that:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    when the pupils know the context well, they comprehend motivations more\n    easily, and they can make critical connections (3.6); the pupils are able to\n    explain the actions of characters more readily when they know the story and\n    context well, e.g., when it is about a child rather than a magical creature\n    in a fairy tale—they also found a text more difficult when it was set around\n    a farm\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    skills that pupils demonstrate in one area do not necessarily transfer to\n    another (3.8); pupils are sometimes able to make claims about the intentions\n    and feelings of characters in fiction, including in fairy tales, but seem to\n    really struggle in poetry\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    pupils can connect details more readily, and understand the relationships\n    between them, when they appear more closely together; in non-fiction, pupils\n    are able to infer motivations if they are described in the same paragraph as\n    a description of the character but struggle when reference to the character\n    is a long way from the context which leads to the action—for example, a\n    newspaper-style account of why an elderly lady is waiting by the letterbox\n    is a long way from text saying that people receive a card from the queen\n    when they are 100 years old\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  What alteration to his normal practice might Kishan make to support his class\n  in reading comprehension?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### Building critical thinking and transfer skills\n\nReflecting on the evidence he had gathered so far, Kishan went back to the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 2, in particular relating to 3g, 3k, 3n and 3p. He found the useful reminder around how pupils need to be secure in their understanding before they can think critically or transfer their knowledge or skills from one domain to another. He thought it would be helpful if his pupils could experience models of how to question, make predictions or summarise to improve reading comprehension. He therefore decided to reorganise the next sequence of learning with the following principles in mind:\n\n- using himself as a model first, thinking out loud as he was reading: asking questions—‘Why do I think Biff did that?’, making predictions—‘I think Biff is going to find the key’ and summarising — ‘So I think that the children all got home safely because they helped each other when they needed it’ (3p)\n- make sure that pupils have a clear understanding of the context presented within the text, and support them in asking questions to do this (3k)\n- present the same type of narrative first (e.g. fiction) until they are confident in comprehending motivations of characters before introducing other forms (e.g. poetry)\n- as those new forms are introduced, be explicit about how the same skills of comprehension might still apply, despite the different form (3g)\n- use succinct texts to start with, and consider using more involved or lengthy texts for those pupils who seem to have a good grasp early on (3n)\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 5 mins\n\nRead the case studies on this week’s topic or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating; as you read, reflect on:\n\n1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation\n2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you\n3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### Action planning\n\nIn your mentor meeting at the start of this module, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.\n\nPlan out how you are going to do that, e.g.,\n\n- If you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, who will you collect it from and when will you do it without adding to your workload?\n- If you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be and when will they observe you?\n- If you are going to collaborate with a colleague, like Yemi and Kishan, who will that be and how will you manage your time?\n\nRemember, as with Module 6, this is a very short inquiry, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect is valid for your inquiry (i.e. that it offers evidence to help you answer your question).\n\n### Theory to Practice: 40 mins\n\nHow you collect your evidence will depend upon the exploratory question you are asking and the sources of evidence you decided you needed. However, it is likely to include the following:\n\n#### 1. Analysing artefacts and data\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘What does my recent marking and recording of assessment data say about the prior knowledge of middle prior attaining boys?’\n- 'What are the misconceptions that pupils typically have about the topic I am about to start teaching?’\n- ‘How appropriate are the textbooks I have for the curriculum I want to teach and the stage my pupils are at?’\n\nIt is useful to remember that pupil work—whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written—is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question.\n\nWhen collecting this sort of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:\n\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |\n| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past—is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s past behaviour record reliable evidence of their behaviour patterns now?                                                                                                |\n| Manageability | For a short inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes—for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources—is a handy way to make sense of the data.                                                            |\n\nKishan and his colleague reviewed samples of pupil work from both their classes on reading comprehension to see if the same problems arose in different types of text. This seemed like a reliable way of checking the problems their pupils had with comprehension and misconceptions.\n\n#### 2. Discuss with pupils\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘What do my pupils say about how effective I am at breaking new material down into smaller steps?’\n- ‘How comfortable are my pupils with sharing their ideas when their understanding is still insecure, and they still have points of confusion?’\n- ‘How easily do my high prior attaining pupils find it to transfer their knowledge from one area so they can apply it in another?’\n- ‘Do my boys like to read?’\n\nWhen collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but… |\n| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them.                                                                                                                                                         |\n\nYemi and her colleague got useful data when they asked their pupils to write their answers to questions and to note when they used supporting texts. They followed this up with three or four focused interviews to gain a more reliable understanding of their pupils’ problems in chemistry.\n\n#### 3. Self-assessment\n\nIn preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying. This does not have to be definitive.\n\ne.g.,\n\nYemi, in Case Study A, said:\n\n> ‘My Year 10 pupils are really motivated, and they like working independently. Many of them can quickly and accurately solve problems, but others are left behind—which seems to get worse when I make the task more complex. When my colleague and I examined their books and spoke to a few pupils, we found that some lacked knowledge of basic science facts and rules, and so could not move on to more complex tasks. I realise now that I need to give them lots of opportunities to recall and practise the fundamentals. I need to think about when I give extra scaffolded support, and when I can withdraw it.’\n\nKishan, in Case Study B, said:\n\n> ‘My pupils seem to be fluent readers, but I noticed that they have problems with reading comprehension. When with a colleague I analysed samples of their work, I found that they appeared to struggle to comprehend motivation when they were unfamiliar with the contexts; that when connected details appeared closer together in a text they seemed to comprehend more readily; and they didn’t easily transfer their comprehension skills in one genre to another. I have decided I need to help build my pupils’ skills with critical thinking and transfer. I suspect the best way of doing this will be to help them become really good at comprehending motivation in short fiction first, before moving to other genres. I also suppose that I could model good questioning, predicting and summarising to help with their comprehension.’\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.\n\nIn that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.\n\n", nil, "2fe8ced4-36ec-4ae1-b82e-f3bf007989db"],

You might have chosen a focus which combines different elements of these standards.\n\nThe teachers in the case studies remind you that you have learned that:\n\n| **Case Study A**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **4.9** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.                                                                           |\n| **4.10** How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.                                                              |\n| **5.5** Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils. |\n\n| **Case Study B**                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **4.3** Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.                  |\n| **4.4** Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases. |\n\n| **Case Study C**                                                                                                                                                           |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **6.5** High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.  |\n| **6.7** Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload. |\n\n| **Case Study D**                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **4.5** Explicitly teaching metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.                |\n| **4.6** Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems. |\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt the start of this term, you reviewed your development needs in relation to Standards 4, 5 & 6 with your mentor, using the Module 8 audit (this was based on the audits from Module 3 and 4 that you completed last year). You also constructed with them an exploratory inquiry question, which will be your focus for the first part of this module. Last week, in your ECT Training session, you looked at how to design different types of inquiry questions, about the advantages of collaboration on an inquiry and how to present your findings so that others can also learn from your inquiry.\n\nNext week, you have another mentor meeting. To prepare for that you should use your self-study time now to define what your normal practice is like in your inquiry focus area, and to collect evidence of impact of your practice upon your pupils.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>\nSchools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make\nuse of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’\nwork, and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils,\nand what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in\nthe main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are\nsaying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do\nthis looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few\npupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with\na colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I\n\n## Case Studies\n\nThese case studies explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment. All are interesting but you should focus on the one or two that most closely relate to the exploratory question you are working on. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice, and how they decided to introduce an alteration to the way they taught. (Later in the module, you will return to these case studies to learn what they did next.)\n\n**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>\nAndy has several vulnerable children in his Year 1 class: very many suffer from low\nself-confidence or poor self-regulation. At the start of the year, he organised his\ntable groups randomly, making only small changes when he sensed that two or more\npupils in a group were disengaging. He was unhappy with their apparent levels of\nmotivation and found that he was struggling to offer the more tailored support to\ngroups that he felt they needed. To explore how he might overcome these problems\nby improving the effectiveness of his grouping strategy, Andy decided to undertake\na practitioner inquiry.\n\nAndy first wanted to get to the bottom of what the impacts were of his current practice of random grouping, and why it appeared not to be working. He had a highly experienced teaching assistant (TA), so he began with this exploratory question:\n\n<blockquote>\n  What has the class TA noticed about the grouping of pupils and its effect on\n  their attainment, behaviour and motivation?\n</blockquote>\nSince the start of the year, Andy and his TA have established the habit of taking\n10 minutes for a cup of tea at the end of the day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays\nto talk about how the pupils have been progressing. He uses one of these informal\nmeetings to gather his TA’s thoughts on what effects his grouping strategy is having\non their pupils’ attainment, behaviour and motivation, and compares this with his\nown reflections.\n\nTheir joint conclusions were that:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    some pupils were reluctant to work with others because they didn’t know them\n    – this was causing low-level disruption to occur in the lesson\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    some were worried about what the other pupils might think if they made a\n    mistake with their learning – they were becoming averse to trying out their\n    ideas\n  </li>\n</ul>\nNeither the TA nor Andy was being effective in how they were targeting their support\nfor their pupils, neither for those who required greater scaffolding nor for those\nwho were ready for more challenge.\n\nAndy also undertook some reading around pupil groupings, to explore a range of options. He re-read the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 3 of the programme and checked his Learning Log. He was especially interested in how, when grouping pupils, care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation (4.10); that, when this was done, paired and group activities can increase pupil success (4.9); changing groups regularly can help avoid the perception that groups are fixed (5n); and flexibly grouping pupils within a class could help him provide more tailored support (5.5). He understood that one important factor in supporting effective collaborative or paired work would be building his pupils’ familiarity with routines (4o).\n\n<strong>\n  What alteration to his teaching might Andy make to improve the effectiveness\n  of his pupils’ work in groups?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively\n\nFollowing discussion with his TA, Andy devised a system whereby all pupils would be obliged to work regularly with two different groups. He took the following steps:\n\n- from the start of a half-term, he introduced a ‘dual grouping’ system in which each pupil was assigned one table group by mixed attainment; and another by a hierarchy of need – where pupils were grouped with others with similar prior attainment for their literacy lessons\n- Andy and his TA kept a close eye on the effects of the mixed attainment groups on motivation and behaviour: in the thrice weekly meetings, they discussed these arrangements and were prepared to make adjustments – these adjustments might help communicate to the pupils that their grouping (and their attainment levels) were not fixed\n- he made sure each day that there was a structured opportunity for the mixed attainment groups to talk together - for example, about their favourite toys, pets, subjects or favourite television programmes: he hoped this would improve motivation and behaviour\n- in their literacy lessons the pupils were regrouped by near attainment. He gave them paper, coloured pencils and a stimulus – such as a toy – for the group to create a story, which they would tell back to the class. Andy concentrated his support on two groups, his TA on one group, and two groups were allowed to work independently. The extra support was to ensure that all pupils were involved in contributing to the group’s story. He was also able to stretch the higher attaining pupils to expand upon their stories by asking them some ‘what if’ questions.\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>\nVashti (a Year 4 teacher) wants to develop an aspect of her practice in relation to literacy. She has found that around one-third of her pupils are still making basic errors with writing week in, week out – in particular, that they are inconsistent in their use of capital letters, full stops and finger spacing. They don’t seem to respond to her written feedback, and she often has to spend time in lessons going over the same ground. She decides she must develop this aspect of her practice so, with her mentor, she agrees to undertake a practitioner inquiry. To begin her inquiry, she writes two exploratory questions:\n<blockquote>How do effective teachers of literacy at Key Stage 2 provide scaffolding and support for struggling writers?\n\nWhat are the characteristics of pupils who struggle with written literacy in Year 4?</blockquote>\nTo answer these questions, Vashti first looked at the evidence she already had to hand:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    She analysed progress data in her mark-book to identify particular pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    She inspected those pupils’ literacy books to compile a list of their common\n    errors\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    She also looked back at her Research and Practice Summary from Module 2 and\n    in her Learning Log where she had noted writing composition strategies\n    through modelling and supported practice\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    She did one extra thing: for twenty minutes, she observed a colleague from\n    Key Stage 2 who is known for making good progress in literacy.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nHaving pulled together this exploratory data, Vashti drew the following tentative\nconclusions:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    effective teachers use physical resources to provide scaffolding for\n    struggling writers – e.g. laminated sheets\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    effective teachers teach different forms of writing by modelling the\n    processes of planning, drafting and editing\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    effective teachers use symbols and icons alongside short, written prompts\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    effective teachers harness the power of classroom talk to help children\n    organise their thoughts before they put pen to paper\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    effective teachers often pair up struggling writers with higher attaining\n    writers.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nOf the six pupils she had identified as struggling, she noticed that five were identified\nas having a Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN).\n\n<strong>\n  What alteration to her normal modelling and scaffolding might Vashti make to\n  support her class to improve their writing?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### **Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing**\n\nVashti decided to create a ‘speaking sentences’ intervention, comprised of the following elements:\n\n- create a physical resource – a laminated sheet with an icon and a key word to remind pupils of the basic features of sentence-writing (e.g. capital letter at start of sentence, capital letter for any names, quote marks to denote spoken language, full stop at end of sentence, finger spacing between words) (4a). She used this scaffold first with all pupils, monitored how her pupils used it then gradually withdrew it from those who were successful without it (4c)\n- model the use of the resource, graphically and verbally using the visualizer (4g) – she modelled this first, narrating her thought processes explicitly (4i), then three confident pupils used the visualizer to show their classmates how they used the laminated sheet\n- create talk partners where target pupils are paired up with stronger writers (4o)\n- model and then require high-quality pair talk as a way of supporting the development of their writing – by practising the talking together in full sentences (3r)\n- in pairs, each pupil talks through the stages of writing a successful sentence, using the laminated sheet as a scaffold (4p) and then they practise writing together for 10 minutes (4d)\n- model the planning, drafting and editing process, whereby pairs have the opportunity to use the laminated sheet to do some interim peer assessment and make improvements to each other’s work (3s)\n- after a writing exercise, ensuring peer feedback is specific and helpful (6k), all pupils use the laminated sheet as a checklist to check their partner’s work and suggest corrections if necessary\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>\nLouise (secondary history) is concerned about her marking workload. Department policy\nstates that books should be marked at least once every two weeks. Louise teaches\n9 classes this year, and it takes her 2 hours to mark a set of books. This means\nthat she typically spends 8 to 10 hours a week marking books. Louise is concerned\nabout the fact that she isn’t able to spend as much time planning lessons as she\nwould like. She is also concerned that some of her pupils don’t seem to find her\nwritten feedback useful, as they often make similar mistakes to those she has corrected\nthe previous week. Following a meeting where she asked her Head of Department whether\nshe could try some different approaches to marking, Louise agreed with him that she\nshould develop this area of her practice. She decided to undertake a practitioner\ninquiry to explore some other approaches to providing her pupils with feedback. To\nget started, she wrote the following, exploratory question:\n<blockquote>\n  What alternative approaches to providing children with feedback are there, as\n  an alternative to written marking?\n</blockquote>\nTo answer this question, Louise first looked at the evidence she could access easily:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    she raised it as an item in a department meeting, and noted her colleagues’\n    alternative ideas about assessment and feedback (6m)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    she looked back to her learning log from Module 4, in particular the\n    references to ‘Making marking manageable and effective’ (6l, 6m, 6n, 6o, 6p,\n    6q)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    she re-read the Research and Practice Summary for Week 5 of Module 4, which\n    gave practical guidance on alternative approaches, and she read again the\n    example of Sara on ‘Reducing the opportunity costs of marking’\n  </li>\n</ul>\nLouise then chose to read more widely. (ECTs will not often have time to do this.)\nShe read online Education Endowment Foundation (2016) <em>\n  A marked improvement? A review of the evidence on written marking.\n</em> Accessible from: <a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf\">\n  https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf\n</a>\n.\n\nAs a result of this exploratory data collection, Louise identified two approaches that she wanted to explore further:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>whole-class verbal feedback (6.5, 6n)</li>\n  <li>\n    an approach known as ‘minimal marking’ whereby the teacher provides feedback\n    in the form of abbreviations and codes, rather than making corrections and\n    writing out ‘what went well / even better if’ comments in longhand (6p)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  What alteration to her marking might Louise make so that it is both effective\n  and manageable?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### Louise’s new approach to marking\n\nLouise consulted her department’s marking policy. Then she:\n\nUse of codes (6p):\n\n- created a set of codes to represent the most common kinds of feedback relating to spelling, punctuation and grammar\n- created codes to represent the success criteria for each written task she set: whether the pupils had referred to source material (SM), and whether they had written a balanced argument (BA), etc. (6k)\n- when marking books, instead of writing comments, wrote short codes in the margin (she found that this took around 1 minute per book, or 30 minutes to mark the class set) (6o)\n- created a slide with a key explaining what each code meant\n\nVerbal feedback (6.5):\n\n- in the feedback lesson, she would also provide whole-class verbal feedback to highlight any common misconceptions she had noticed when marking the books (6n)\n- made sure that her codes led to specific actions for pupils, and provided 15 minutes at the start of lessons for her pupils to respond to the feedback (6h)\n\n$CTA\n\n<h3>Case Study D: Questioning</h3>\nMo wants to work on his use of questioning with his Year 11 GCSE PE class. He finds\nthat lots of lesson time is spent on providing pupils with detailed instruction and\nfeedback about how to meet particular assessment objectives for the exam, and he\nsometimes feels that he is working harder than his pupils in lessons. He wants to\nimprove his use of questioning as a way to stimulate pupils to think, talk and write\nmore in lessons. Following a meeting with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning,\nMo decides to undertake a practitioner inquiry to help him improve and evaluate his\nuse of questioning in lessons.\n\nTo begin, Mo writes two exploratory questions:\n\n<blockquote>What kinds of questions do I typically ask in lessons?\n\nWhat kinds of questioning are effective for teachers to use?</blockquote>\nMo’s school has video cameras installed in classrooms for professional development purposes so, to answer the first question, Mo decided to film himself teaching a typical lesson and then watch it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning. (If the technology had not been available, nor a colleague free to observe him, he could instead have trained a pupil to observe him for how he asks questions.) He made a tally of the kinds of questions he asked during the lesson, and brief notes on the way pupils responded to his questioning. He made the following observations:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Mo asked a total of 23 questions in the lesson</li>\n  <li>\n    of these, 17 were to do with classroom management, rather than content –\n    e.g. “Are you OK?”, “Have you got what you need?”, “Do you know what you’re\n    supposed to be doing?”\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    when he did ask questions about the content of the lesson, they tended to be\n    closed questions (e.g. “Can you name the three bones in the ankle?”, “Who\n    can tell me what the difference is between concentric and eccentric muscle\n    contractions?”)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    of the 6 questions he asked about lesson content, 3 were addressed to the\n    whole class, rather than directing them at particular pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    of 3 questions he directed to particular pupils, Mo did not give the pupils\n    much “wait time” – if they paused for more than a second or two, he would\n    ask another pupil in order to maintain the pace of the lesson, and to avoid\n    the pupil feeling embarrassed if they did not know the answer\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    on one occasion, Mo gave the pupils the opportunity to look up and discuss a\n    question before asking them publicly. When he did this, the pupil was able\n    to provide a much more in-depth answer. However, Mo did not ask the pupil to\n    elaborate further on the answer they provided\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    during the observation, the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning noticed\n    that:\n    <ul>\n      <li>boys spoke more than girls in the lesson</li>\n      <li>5 pupils did not speak at all, other than to their table partner</li>\n      <li>of these, 4 were Pupil Premium girls</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTo answer the second question, Mo spoke informally over lunch to some experienced\ncolleagues in other subjects. He looked back in his Learning Log from Module 3, and\nre-read the Research and Practice Summaries from weeks 3 and 4, paying particular\nattention to the example of Christine, teaching metacognitive strategies to her class.\nThrough this, he identified three key ideas he wanted to explore further – direction,\nelaboration and metacognition. In order to develop a more dynamic, responsive approach\nto questioning, Mo wrote a plan based around these three key ideas. In particular,\nhe planned the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    direction - direct questions at particular pupils, having given them time to\n    prepare and discuss and answer (4n)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    focus on the ‘third turn’ (i.e. what he says in response to a pupil’s answer\n    to a question), asking follow-up questions to encourage pupils to dig deeper\n    in their thinking, and to build on one another’s ideas (5k, 6f) and\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ask questions that promote metacognition, asking pupils to reflect on their\n    existing (and emerging) knowledge and understanding, and helping them plan,\n    monitor and evaluate their own learning (4.5, 4l)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n  What alteration to his approach to questioning might help Mo to stimulate his\n  pupils to think, talk (and write) more in GCSE PE lessons?\n</strong>\n$CTA\n\n### **Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improving questioning**\n\nHe printed out a set of prompt questions and left them on his desk, so that he could refer to them at a glance during the lesson if he needed a reminder. (E.g. What if I told you the opposite was true? Why does that answer make sense to you? How do you know? How might you argue against this? Which ideas make the most sense and why?)\n\nMo understands that questions can be used for many purposes (4.6), therefore the kinds of questions teachers ask need to be adapted in relation to the purpose of the questioning. As a general guide, Mo creates a list of principles of ‘responsive questioning’ that he can draw on at different times, to suit the aims of the lesson:\n\n- organise the class into pairs\n- when I ask a question, give each pair 2 minutes to discuss it, and to consult their notes / the textbook if need be (4.7, 4n)\n- use a class list to make sure I direct at least one question at each pupil at some point in the lesson (direction) (5.3)\n- ask a variety of questions: open, closed, content-based, process-based, exploratory, retrieval, checking, linking ideas (4m)\n- where appropriate, give up to 10 seconds of wait time before moving on (e.g. if they haven’t had time to prepare an answer in advance) (4n)\n- where possible/appropriate, ask pupils to elaborate on their answers on the ‘third turn’ (elaboration) (6f)\n- use the question list to build on each pupil’s answer, reframing questions and directing questions to other pupils in the class (5k)\n- ask pupils questions that help them see the constituent parts, to encourage them to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning (metacognition) (4e)\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 5 mins\n\nRead the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation\n2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you\n3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### **Action planning**\n\nIn your mentor meeting at the start of this module, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.\n\nPlan out how you are going to do that, e.g.\n\n- if you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, who will you collect it from and when will you do it?\n- if you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be and when will they observe you?\n- if you are going to collaborate with a colleague, like Vashti, Louise and Mo, who will that be and how will you manage your time?\n\nThe exploratory phase of your inquiry – just like with Modules 6 and 7 – is very short, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect is valid for your inquiry, i.e. that it offers evidence to help you answer your question.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 40 mins\n\nHow you collect your evidence will depend upon the exploratory question you are asking and the sources of evidence you decided you needed. However, it is likely to include the following:\n\n#### 1. Analyse artefact and data\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘To what extent do my lesson plans suggest that I am organising activities around what I want my pupils to think hard about?’\n- ‘What aspects of my current teaching of pupils with SEND are recommended within the SEND Code of Practice?’\n- ‘Looking at the data I have over a number of assessments, what tentative conclusions can I draw about the patterns of my pupils’ performance?’\n\nIt is useful to remember that pupil work – whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written – is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question. School policies and codes of practice are useful artefacts to explore, as are curriculum plans and mark books.\n\nWhen collecting this sort of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:\n\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |\n| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s previous learning record reliable evidence of their learning patterns now?                                                                                            |\n| Manageability | For a short exploratory inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes – for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources – is a handy way to make sense of the data.                                            |\n\nVashti analysed progress data to identify particular pupils who needed support with writing, and she conducted a book scrutiny to compile a list of common errors in those pupils’ books. Louise raised an item in a department meeting to discover alternative approaches to marking. Mo filmed himself teaching a typical lesson and then watched it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning.\n\nAll of these methods were manageable and gave them a reliable snapshot of their (or their colleagues’) normal practice.\n\n#### 2. Discuss with pupils\n\nYour question may have been something like:\n\n- ‘To what extent do I currently take account of my pupils’ levels of prior understanding when I introduce new content to them? What do my pupils say about this?’\n- ‘Do all my pupils – regardless of prior attainment – agree that I have high expectations of them? Do I adapt lessons appropriately to support and challenge all pupils?’\n- ‘When I use peer assessment, is the feedback from the pupils specific enough to help move their learning on?’\n\nFor all of these questions, it would be useful to make pupil voice part of your evidence gathering. When collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                |\n| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. Open questions may give you rich data, but it can be arduous to analyse; closed questions (or ones when you ask pupils to place themselves on a 1-5 scale) are easy to analyse but might tell you less than you wish to know. Some combination of open and closed might be a good way forward for you. |\n\n#### 3. Self-assessment\n\nIn preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about your normal practice. This does not have to be definitive.\n\ne.g.\n\nAndy, in Case Study A, said:\n\n> ‘At the start of the year with my Year 1s, I arranged my groups randomly because I did not know them very well. I found in my exploratory inquiry, by talking to my TA, that some pupils were apparently reluctant to work with others because they didn’t know them, and others were worried about what the other children might think if they make a mistake with their learning. I realised also that my TA and I were unable to give our pupils the levels of support and challenge they needed. I have decided that I need to build their confidence to work with others, not just their friends. I also need to group them so I can better tailor my support to them.’\n\nLouise, in Case Study C, said:\n\n> ‘I teach 9 different history classes so it can take me up to 10 hours a week to mark their books according to the department policy. I spoke to the other teachers in my department and found that they were keeping within their policies but taking other approaches, like whole-class verbal feedback. They also told me about something they called ‘minimal marking’ whereby the teacher provides feedback in the form of abbreviations and codes, rather than making corrections and writing out ‘what went well / even better if’ comments in longhand. I definitely need to try methods like these, to see if my pupils can maintain their current progress without me marking so much.’\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.\n\nIn that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.\n\n", nil, "fe9093ce-823c-40a2-9f87-ee6bbce2ea58"],

You may have introduced an adjustment – e.g. because you felt your pupils were ready for a different challenge, or because you wanted to expand the focus of your inquiry. Last week, your mentor observed you and gave you feedback which adds to your evidence base.\n\nThis week, you have some time to collate your evidence to this point. What are you learning about the way you are teaching now – and the impact this has on your pupils? Can you make a tentative claim for what you know so far?\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>\nSchools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make\nuse of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’\nwork – and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils\n– and what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection,\nin the main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are\nsaying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do\nthis looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few\npupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with\na colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I\n\nNext week, you have another mentor meeting. It will be the mid-point review of your inquiry, when you will revisit the audit you conducted at the start of Module 8.\n\n## Case Studies\n\nYou have seen these case studies before: they explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment.\n\nYou can read back to Weeks 3 or 5, if you want to remind yourself of the issue they wanted to tackle and the alterations to their practice that they implemented.\n\nWe pick them up here from the point where they have framed their evaluative inquiry question. We see the methods they decide to use to collect evidence; we see how some of them choose to make a further adjustment to their practice after starting their inquiries; and we begin to see evidence of impact on them and their pupils as this begins to emerge.\n\n**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>\n<h4>Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively in Year 1</h4>\nTo evaluate the impact of his pupil grouping intervention, Andy wrote the\nfollowing evaluative question:\n<blockquote>\n  How can I use group activities over two half-terms to improve the engagement\n  and attainment of my Year 1 pupils?\n</blockquote>\nAndy considered the following sources of data:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    brief observation notes made by himself and the Teaching Assistant (TA)\n    during the lessons and shared briefly after school three times a week\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    his own observations and reflections on the extent to which the pupil\n    grouping intervention was having the desired effect on their engagement\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    the progress records for his class that he had been updating twice weekly to\n    measure their attainment\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Further adjustments</h4>\nAndy was aware that this intervention might cause some pupils some distress, as he\nwas nudging them out of their comfort zones. He was therefore prepared to experience\na certain amount of pushback at first, while the children adjusted to this new way\nof working. He made time to listen to any of their concerns at the beginning of lunchtime,\nand found that after a few days, the complaints dried up as the children adapted\nto this new way of working.\n\nThe following half-term as he monitored the impact of the group activities, Andy decided to make a further adjustment, whereby pupils were required to work in near attainment groups for all literacy and numeracy lessons: this would help him to target his and his TA’s support for particular groups of pupils. The pupils would then return to their mixed attainment group tables when studying other topics. He reminded himself of some of the other reading he had done of Research and Practice Summaries in year 1, this time relating to setting high expectations (Standard 1) and managing behaviour effectively (Standard 7). Throughout the inquiry period, Andy repeatedly reminded the children of the aim they were all working towards – to be able to work and talk productively with everyone in the class (1.3). Andy reinforced good behaviour with the use of verbal praise and by awarding house points, publicly celebrating the features of productive talk he wanted to see more of, such as listening carefully, sharing resources and building on the ideas of others (7.6, 7o).\n$I\n\n### Evidence of impact so far\n\nThe ECF statements, across several standards, helped Andy to make sense of what his evidence was telling him.\n\nFrom the evidence he has collected so far, Andy understands that:\n\n**1.3** Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.\n\n- by repeatedly making his intentions clear, he has been able to ‘bring the children with him’ on this journey to helping them to work productively with any of their peers\n\n**4.9.** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.\n\n- by using the same method in every literacy lesson for a term, and extending this to numeracy lessons after one half-term – and switching between mixed and near attainment groupings - he has given the children many opportunities to practise working with others, and therefore to get better at doing so over time\n\n**4.10.** How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.\n\n- a small number of the mixed attainment groupings have proven problematic, but\n- several of his pupils have become much more confident in working with a wider range of peers\n\nThrough engaging in the inquiry so far, Andy has also learned better how to:\n\nCommunicate a belief in the academic potential of all of his pupils, by:\n\n**1a.** Using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration.\n\n- his TA – who had been working in Key Stage 1 for many years – feels the class have made much faster progress than other classes she has known\n\nAnd he has:\n\n**1e.** Created a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils).\n\n- publicly celebrating the features of productive talk he wanted to see more of, such as listening carefully, sharing resources and building on the ideas of others\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>\n<h4>Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing in Year 4</h4>\nTo ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Vashti devised this\nevaluative inquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  How can I use ‘speaking sentences’ well, over the space of two terms, to\n  reduce the prevalence of basic errors in written literacy among pupils with a\n  Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN) in Year 4?\n</blockquote>\nVashti considered the following evidence she already had to hand:\n<ul>\n  <li>data from her marking of writing assessments from the target class</li>\n  <li>\n    data from her colleagues’ marking of writing assessments from her control\n    group, the two other year 4 classes (they record such data centrally in her\n    school)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    personal reflections and observations generated through dialogue in her\n    mentor meetings, and recorded in her Learning Log\n  </li>\n</ul>\nAdditionally, she held a short, 5-minute ‘focus group’ with the 4 target pupils\nat the start and end of the intervention.\n<h4>Further adjustments</h4>\nHalfway through the study period, Vashti noticed that the pupils were improving\nin some aspects of their writing. However, they were still often mis-spelling\nhigh frequency words. As a result of this mid-cycle analysis, she realised she\ncould use her scaffold to more deliberately plan for her pupils to be exposed to\nhigh-utility, high-frequency vocabulary (3o): she decided to add a table of\nhigh-frequency words to the laminated scaffold sheet, with the correct spelling\nin the ‘tick’ column, and common mis-spellings in the ‘cross’ column. Because\nshe was encouraged by her early observations and reflections, she also expanded\nthe use of ‘speaking sentences’ to all pupils in her class, with three levels of\nscaffold sheets adapted for her pupils’ prior attainment, monitor their use and\nwithdraw them as her pupils became more successful (4a, 4c). $I\n\n### Evidence of impact so far\n\nThe ECF statements, across several standards, helped Vashti to make sense of what her evidence was telling her about her own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, she learned better how to:\n\n**6b.** Draw conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance).\n\n- 5 of the 6 target SpLCN pupils have made significant progress in the summative writing assessment\n\n**4d.** Provide sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and practise applying new knowledge and skills.\n\n- several pupils are able to describe how they have benefited from using the laminated sheet and the speaking activity to organise their thinking and their writing\n\nReflecting on her findings, Vashti drew the following interim conclusion for her own teaching:\n\nClassroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful\ndriver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4. (4a, 4p)\n\nShe realised that she should continue with this approach to supporting her pupils’ writing, but keep a careful eye on the successful use of the scaffold, so her pupils could still succeed when she withdrew it.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>\n<h4>Louise’s new approach to marking in Secondary History</h4>\nTo ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Louise devised this\nevaluative inquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  How can I implement codes and verbal feedback well, so that my Year 9 History\n  pupils are able to correct misconceptions and make progress, and I am able to\n  reduce the amount of time I spend marking?\n</blockquote>\nTo evaluate the impact of her ‘minimal marking’ intervention, Louise decided to\ncollect the following naturally occurring data:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    pupil voice – using a hands-up survey in class – with the experimental class\n    (before and after the half-term), to capture how well they felt they had\n    been guided to improve their work\n  </li>\n  <li>book scrutiny of a sample of target pupils</li>\n  <li>\n    summative assessment of a written piece, from both of her classes so she\n    could compare\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    focus group conversation (5 min lunchtime conversation with target pupils)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Further adjustments</h4>\nAfter using her new method once, Louise noticed that some of her pupils didn’t seem\nto understand how they were supposed to respond to the coded feedback. She also realised\nthat she was not always allowing them enough time in lesson to respond to her feedback.\n\nIn the next lesson, she used a visualizer to model how she expected pupils to respond to each of the codes, and gave her pupils a second chance to respond to her feedback. (4a)\n\nIn addition to the slide, where she had explained the most common codes, she added a ‘Time to Respond’ box – as a reminder both to herself and her pupils. (6h)\n$I\n\n### Evidence of impact so far\n\nThe ECF statements, across several standards, helped Louise to make sense of what her evidence was telling her about her own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, she learned better how to:\n\n**6p.** Reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal feedback.\n\n- she was able to cut the marking time for a set of books from 2 hours to 30 minutes\n- her two Year 9 classes (one experimental, one control group) achieved a very similar distribution of scores in a summative written assessment\n- her pupils in the experimental group had not encountered any significant problems as a result of the new way of marking\n\n**6h.** Give whole-class feedback so they know what they need to do to improve and have the time to do it.\n\n- she practised giving whole-class feedback, having created a standard slide, which reminded her to give specific feedback and 15 minutes a lesson to do it\n\nBased on these findings, Louise made the following tentative claims from her inquiry:\n\n- using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress, compared with a standard written marking approach\n- on average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher over an hour a week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach\n\nHaving reviewed her practice in this way, she will use this insight to now apply the same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and Year 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study D: Questioning</h3>\n<h4>Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improve questioning in GCSE PE</h4>\nTo ensure he was developing his practice effectively, Mo devised this evaluative\ninquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  How can I best adapt the way I ask questions, implemented every lesson for one\n  term, to improve the quality and amount of talk among Pupil Premium girls in\n  Y11 GCSE PE?\n</blockquote>\nTo help him answer this question, Mo decided to collect the following data:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    arrange a follow-up lesson observation with the Assistant Head for Teaching\n    and Learning, using the school’s in-class video technology\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    interview a sample of pupils, including Pupil Premium girls, in a focus\n    group lasting 5 minutes after final period on a Wednesday\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    book scrutiny, sampling 6 of the target pupils, compared with a sample of 6\n    high attaining pupils – Mo marks these books every other week, so this data\n    is near to hand\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Further adjustments</h4>\nOnce he started collecting evidence, Mo decided he needed to make one adjustment\nto his approach for the inquiry. In particular, based on his marking of books, he\nwrote key questions that he would target at particular pupils, to make sure that\nhe was able to check understanding and fill gaps as they progress from one lesson\nto the next. (6a)\n\nMo also started using his new approach to ‘responsive questioning’ with his other classes. (4m)\n$I\n\n### Evidence of impact so far\n\nThe ECF statements, across several standards, helped Mo to make sense of what his evidence was telling him about his own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, he learned better how to:\n\n**4m.** Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils.\n\n- he saw much more evidence of high-quality questioning in his second filmed lesson\n- all 16 pupils were asked a question at some point in the lesson\n\n**6f.** Prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.\n\n- all were asked follow-up questions to help them elaborate on their thinking\n- there was a change in the books of the Pupil Premium girls during the inquiry period – their written responses were far more articulate and well-structured, reflecting the discussions they had had in class\n\n**4n.** Provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required.\n\n- all were given sufficient wait time\n- the pupils liked the fact that he gave them time to prepare an answer before calling on them\n\nBased on this, Mo made the following tentative claim from his inquiry so far:\n\n> Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality\n> of talk and writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.\n\nAnd because he had developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo decided to apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 5 mins\n\nRead the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation\n2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you\n3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### Action planning\n\nTake a few minutes to plan how you will use your self-directed study time this week. Think about:\n\n- what evidence you already have for the way you teach now, and the impact it has on your pupils, e.g.\n\n  - your module audit\n  - observation notes from last week\n  - the work your pupils are producing\n  - what your pupils are saying in class, how they are responding to feedback\n\n- what evidence it would still be useful for you to collect, e.g.\n\n  - the views of your pupils about this change in your practice – how has it altered their attitudes to learning?\n  - how the responses of your pupils to the change in your teaching may have altered over time – some may have started well but begun to level off. Can you track that?\n  - how the change in your practice is affecting different pupils in different ways\n  - the impact of your inquiry on yourself\n\nSo, this week you might divide your time between analysing evidence you already have and designing a collection tool for evidence you don’t.\n\n### Theory to Practice: 40 mins\n\nHow you collect your evidence will depend upon the area of your practice that you are seeking to improve and the evaluative inquiry question you are asking. However, it is likely to include the following:\n\n#### 1. Analyse artefacts and data\n\nRemind yourself of the area of your practice that you are trying to improve and of your evaluative inquiry question, and think again about the sources of evidence that might shed light upon it. These might include ‘artefacts’ such as the following:\n\n- your pupils’ work – whether written, spoken, performed, or created\n- your assessment of pieces of work, and your assessment of the pupils over time – and how that compares with other pupils, or expected outcomes\n- policy and guidance documents\n- lesson plans, curriculum plans, learning resources\n- observations by you or of you\n\nIt is useful to remember that pupil work – whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written – is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question. You should realise that this is work you have already done – not extra work.\n\nSchool policies and codes of practice are useful artefacts to explore, as are curriculum plans and mark books.\n\nWhether analysing data you already have, or creating an evidence collection tool, it is helpful to bear in mind:\n\n|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |\n| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s previous learning record reliable evidence of their learning patterns now?                                                                                            |\n| Manageability | Be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes – for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources – is a handy way to make sense of the data.                                                                                                   |\n\nAndy asked his TA to keep brief observation notes and discuss them with him at the end of the day; he also took a note of his own observations of the extent to which the pupil grouping intervention was having the desired effect.\n\nVashti inspected progress data from writing assessments for her own class, and compared this with two other Year 4 classes (which are acting as her control group); she is also keeping a note of her personal reflections.\n\nLouise analysed a summative assessment (and compared this with another of her classes, her control group); she also conducted a book scrutiny of her class’s books with a colleague.\n\nMo filmed a second lesson to compare it with the first, and likewise watched it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning; like Louise, he also conducted a book scrutiny of his PE class’s books with a colleague.\n\nAll of these methods were manageable and gave them a reliable insight into the emerging effects of the alterations to their practice and their evaluative inquiries.\n\n#### 2. Discuss with pupils\n\nRemind yourself of the area of your practice that you are trying to improve and of your evaluative inquiry question and think again about the sources of evidence that might shed light upon it. These might include examples of pupil voice such as the following:\n\n- focus interviews with ‘target’ pupils – you can often do these during a lesson, while others are working independently\n- surveys conducted in class (e.g. where you ask pupils to put their hand up if they agree, or they answer a small number of questions instantly)\n- when you ‘eavesdrop’ on pupils as they discuss an issue with a partner\n- whole class discussion on the issue you want feedback on\n\nWhen analysing evidence of pupils’ attitudes to learning, or creating a pupil voice evidence collection method, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                |\n| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. Open questions may give you rich data, but it can be arduous to analyse; closed questions (or ones when you ask pupils to place themselves on a 1-5 scale) are easy to analyse but might tell you less than you wish to know. Some combination of open and closed might be a good way forward for you. |\n\nVashti also carried out individual interviews with each of the 4 target pupils at the start and end of her inquiry (taking 5 minutes each with them, while other pupils worked independently); similarly, Mo interviewed a sample of pupils, including the Pupil Premium girls who were his focus.\n\nLouise carried out a hands-up pupil survey with her experimental class (before and after the half-term), to capture their thoughts on marking, and followed this up with a focus group conversation with a small group of pupils for 10 minutes at lunchtime.\n\n#### 3. Self-assessment – making the claim\n\nIn preparation for your mentor meeting next week (where you will revisit your Module 8 audit), write a ‘claim’ to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about the impacts of your alteration to practice. This will still not be definitive: there are still some weeks to go before your inquiry is finished. It is useful to get into the habit of evaluating the impact of what you are doing, to help you decide in the future what you will continue to do, what you will do more of, and perhaps what you will stop doing.\n\nIf you have been using multiple methods of data collection – however simple – this will strengthen your claim. If you feel something is so, if your pupils say it is so, and if your progress data suggests it is so, then you can make a fairly strong claim.\n\nNot all inquiries lead to positive results. Inquiries that lead to uncertain conclusions are not a waste of time – quite the reverse, such inquiries often generate more questions for further investigation. Disappointing findings can also be incredibly valuable.\n\nHere are the claims made by some of the teachers featured in the case studies.\n\n**Vashti:**\n\nThrough her inquiry, Vashti was learning better how to plan effective lessons, by (4a) using scaffolds for pupils who needed more structure; better how to stimulate her pupils’ thinking, by (4p, 3r) providing scaffolds for talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue; and better how to provide frequent opportunities for her pupils, in pairs, to plan, draft and edit their writing. Her claim is:\n\n> Classroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful\n> driver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4.\n\nShe is going to keep monitoring her use of the ‘speaking sentences’ scaffold.\n\n**Louise:**\n\nThrough experimenting with ‘minimal marking’ as an alternative to always giving full written feedback, she learned better how to reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal feedback (6p). She also learned better how to give whole-class feedback so they knew what they needed to do to improve, and had the time to do it (6h). Her claims therefore are:\n\n> 1. Using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress, compared with a standard written marking approach.\n\n> 2. On average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher about an hour a week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach.\n\nShe will use this insight to now apply the same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and Year 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.\n\n**Mo:**\n\nThrough expanding his range of questioning approaches, Mo learned better how to include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (4m), provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required (4n), and prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding (6f). Based on this, his claim is:\n\n> Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality\n> of talk and writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.\n\nAnd because he has developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo has decided to apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your claim to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.\n\nIn that meeting, you will revisit the audit that you completed at the start of Module 8. To that end, you may also bring other supporting evidence to discuss your progress across Standards 4, 5 and 6.\n\n", nil, "4df1a9ff-8d32-4538-82a4-841d71060d32"],

You might have chosen a focus which combines different elements of these standards.\n\n$I\nLook at the individual case studies below to see what the featured teachers had learned by this stage of their inquiries.\n\nIn this session you will learn that engaging in practitioner inquiry, focused on the evidence base of the ECF, can have positive effects, not only on your practical knowledge, but also your beliefs, your workload and your professional relationships.\n$I\n\n## Introduction\n\nLast week with your mentor you considered the wider range of emergent evidence for your inquiry: not just the evidence you collected deliberately (and for which you had an anticipated outcome) but the overheard and unexpected evidence too. Before that, you reminded yourself of the counter-evidence, or the potential negative consequences of your inquiry. Last week, you updated your ‘claim’ to take account of inferences you can make from all of these forms of evidence.\n\nHow valid are the inferences you made? In this week’s self-study time, you should firm up the evidence to support the inferences you made last week.\n\nFinally, you are going to create an account of the impact on you of engaging in practitioner inquiry.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>\nSchools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make\nuse of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’\nwork and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils\nand what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in\nthe main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are\nsaying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do\nthis looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few\npupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with\na colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I\n\n## Case Studies\n\nYou have seen these case studies before: they explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment.\n\nYou can read back to Weeks 3 or 5, if you want to remind yourself of the issue they wanted to tackle and the alterations to their practice that they implemented.\n\nHere we see the inferences they make from the range of evidence they collected. We also begin to see the range of impacts the inquiries have had upon them personally: on their beliefs, workload and relationships with colleagues.\n\n**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>\n<h4>Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively in Year 1</h4>\nAndy devised this evaluative question:\n<blockquote>\n  How can I use group activities over two half-terms to improve the engagement\n  and attainment of my Year 1 pupils?\n</blockquote>\nAfter making small adjustments to his inquiry to account for pupils’ feedback,\nhe was able to draw these insights from the deliberate evidence:\n<ul>\n  <li>his pupil grouping interventions have largely been effective</li>\n  <li>\n    a small number of the mixed attainment groupings have proven problematic\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    by repeatedly making his intentions clear, he has been able to ‘bring the\n    children with him’ on this journey to helping them to work productively with\n    any of their peers\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    by using the same method every literacy lesson for a term, extending this to\n    numeracy after one half-term and switching between mixed and near attainment\n    groupings, he has given the children many opportunities to practise working\n    with others, and therefore to get better at doing so over time\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    several of his pupils have become much more confident in working with a\n    wider range of peers\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    his TA – who had been working in Key Stage 1 for many years – feels the\n    class have made much faster progress than other classes she has known\n  </li>\n</ul>\nFrom the wider emergent (overhead and unexpected) evidence, Andy made these\ninferences:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    he overheard his pupils say things like ‘I used to not like working with X,\n    but now I like it’ – the new pupil grouping is having the desired effect\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    his Year 1s overall made unexpectedly rapid progress with the accuracy of\n    their mark making – the new pupil grouping improved the pupils socially and\n    in their written literacy\n  </li>\n</ul>\n$I\n\n### The impact the inquiry has had on Andy’s beliefs and professional relationships\n\nThe inquiry involved Andy working more productively with his TA. He is now much firmer in his belief that:\n\n**1.1** Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.\n\n**1.3** Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.\n\n**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge.\n\n**4.7** High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.\n\n**4.9** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.\n\n**5.5** Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.\n\n**7.6** Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).\n\n**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>\n<h4>Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing in Year 4</h4>\nTo ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Vashti devised this\nevaluative inquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    How can I use ‘speaking sentences’ well, over the space of two terms, to\n    reduce the prevalence of basic errors in written literacy among pupils with\n    a Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN) in Year 4?\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\nAfter making small adjustments to her inquiry – because her pupils were still\noften mis-spelling high frequency words – she was able to draw these insights\nfrom the deliberate evidence:\n\n<strong>6b.</strong> Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking\nat patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments\ndraw inferences about learning from performance).\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    5 of the 6 target SpLCN pupils have made significant progress in the\n    summative writing assessment\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4d.</strong> Providing sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate\nand practise applying new knowledge and skills.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    several pupils are able to describe how they have benefited from using the\n    laminated sheet and the speaking activity to organise their thinking and\n    their writing\n  </li>\n</ul>\nReflecting on her findings, Vashti drew the following interim conclusion for her\nown teaching:\n<blockquote>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    Classroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful\n    driver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4.\n    (4a, 4p)\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\nShe realised that she should continue with this approach to supporting her\npupils’ writing, but keep a careful eye on the successful use of the scaffold,\nso her pupils could still succeed when she withdrew it.\n\nFrom the wider emergent (overhead and unexpected) evidence, Vashti made these inferences:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    she overheard several of the non-SpLCN pupils, but who also have other\n    additional needs, say that the ‘speaking sentences’ approach made them much\n    more confident when writing – the approach can work with all pupils who have\n    additional needs\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    unexpectedly, the oracy of the SpLCN pupils also improved markedly over the\n    period – scaffolds which reduce basic errors in one area of literacy may\n    also have a similar effect in others\n  </li>\n</ul>\nShe inferred that this was because she had learned better how to:\n\n<strong>3r.</strong> Model and require high-quality oral language, recognising that\nit underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond\nto questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary).\n\n<strong>3s.</strong> Teaching different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting\nand editing.\n\n<strong>4a.</strong> Use modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that\nnovices need more structure early in a domain.\n\n<strong>4d.</strong> Provide sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and\npractise applying new knowledge and skills..\n\n<strong>4p.</strong> Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour\nof dialogue. $I\n\n### The impact the inquiry has had on Vashti’s beliefs, workload and professional relationships\n\nThe inquiry involved Vashti observing three colleagues. She is now much firmer in her belief that:\n\n**3.10** Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines.\n\n**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge.\n\n**4.4** Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.\n\n**4.7** High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.\n\n**5.1** Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.\n\n**5.3** Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.\n\n**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve.\n\nShe has also saved on her workload because she has learned that:\n\n**5.4** Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.\n\n$I\n\n<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>\n<h4>Louise’s new approach to marking in Secondary History</h4>\nTo ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Louise devised this\nevaluative inquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    How can I implement codes and verbal feedback well, so that my Year 9\n    History pupils are able to correct misconceptions and make progress, and I\n    am able to reduce the amount of time I spend marking?\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\nLouise noticed that some of her pupils didn’t seem to understand how they were\nsupposed to respond to the coded feedback. After making small adjustments to her\ninquiry she was able to draw these insights from the deliberate evidence:\n\n<strong>6p.</strong> Reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal\nfeedback.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    she was able to cut the marking time for a set of books from 2 hours to 30\n    minutes\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    her two Year 9 classes (one experimental, one control group) achieved a very\n    similar distribution of scores in a summative written assessment\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    her pupils in the experimental group had not encountered any significant\n    problems as a result of the new way of marking\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6h.</strong> Give whole-class feedback so they know what they need to do\nto improve and have the time to do it.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    she practised giving whole-class feedback, having created a standard slide,\n    which reminded her to give specific feedback and 15 minutes a lesson to do\n    it\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBased on these findings, Louise made the following tentative claims from her\ninquiry:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress,\n    compared with a standard written marking approach.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    On average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher about an hour a\n    week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nHaving reviewed her practice in this way, she will use this insight to now apply\nthe same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and\nYear 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.\n\nFrom the wider emergent (overheard and unexpected) evidence, Louise made these inferences:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    she overheard several high prior attaining girls in her experimental Year 9\n    class say that they preferred the new form of feedback, because they\n    received it much more quickly – pupils don’t necessarily ‘miss’ having their\n    work marked all of the time\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    she overheard a few pupils in her control Year 9 class say they heard what\n    she was doing in her other class, and ‘why can’t we have that?’ – verbal and\n    coded feedback might be popular with pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    expectedly, she saved time on marking; unexpectedly, she used that gained\n    time to prepare better lessons – reducing unnecessary marking can have an\n    overall positive impact on her teaching\n  </li>\n</ul>\nShe inferred that this was because she had learned better how to:\n\n<strong>6h</strong> Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for pupils\nto respond to feedback.\n\n<strong>6i</strong> Appreciate that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending\non a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains…).\n\n<strong>6n</strong> Use verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback\nafter lessons where possible.\n\n<strong>6p</strong> Reduce the opportunity cost of marking (e.g. by using abbreviations\nand codes in written feedback). $I\n\n### The impact the inquiry has had on Louise’s beliefs and workload\n\nShe is now much firmer in her belief that:\n\n**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning.\n\n**6.1** Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.\n\n**6.4** To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.\n\n**6.5** High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.\n\n**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve.\n\nShe has also saved on her workload because she has learned that:\n\n**6.7** Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.\n\n$I\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Case Study D: Questioning</h3>\n<h4>Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improve questioning in GCSE PE</h4>\nTo ensure he was developing his practice effectively, Mo devised this evaluative\ninquiry question:\n<blockquote>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    How can I best adapt the way I ask questions, implemented every lesson for\n    one term, to improve the quality and amount of talk among Pupil Premium\n    girls in Y11 GCSE PE?\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\nAfter extending his approach to his other classes, he was able to draw these\ninsights from the deliberate evidence:\n\n<strong>4m.</strong> Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to\nextend and challenge pupils.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    he saw much more evidence of high-quality questioning in his second filmed\n    lesson\n  </li>\n  <li>all 16 pupils were asked a question at some point in the lesson</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6f.</strong> Prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning\nto check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    all were asked follow-up questions to help them elaborate on their thinking\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    there was a change in the books of the Pupil Premium girls during the\n    inquiry period – their written responses were far more articulate and\n    well-structured, reflecting the discussions they had had in class\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4n.</strong> Provide appropriate wait time between question and response\nwhere more developed responses are required.\n<ul>\n  <li>all were given sufficient wait time</li>\n  <li>\n    the pupils liked the fact that he gave them time to prepare an answer before\n    calling on them\n  </li>\n</ul>\nBased on this, Mo made the following tentative claim from his inquiry so far:\n<blockquote>\n  Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality of talk and\n  writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.\n</blockquote>\nAnd because he had developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo decided\nto apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.\n\nFrom the wider emergent (overheard and unexpected) evidence, Mo made these inferences:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    he overheard pupils outside of his focus group comment on his new approach\n    to questioning. ‘Sir makes us think much harder these days’ – this approach\n    can work for all, not just some, pupils\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    a colleague in the staffroom told him he had heard about Mo’s approach to\n    questioning, and asked for more information – doing an inquiry about an\n    aspect of teaching can improve collaborative relationships with colleagues\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    the Pupil Premium girls also improved with their practical PE work –\n    although tempted, Mo could not infer from that that his approach to\n    questioning improves their sporting skills\n  </li>\n</ul>\nHe inferred that this was because he had learned better how to:\n\n<strong>4l.</strong> Plan activities around what you want pupils to think hard about.\n\n<strong>8f. </strong>Contribute positively to the wider school culture and\ndevelop a feeling of shared responsibility for improving the lives of all pupils\nwithin the school. $I\n\n### The impact the inquiry has had on Mo’s beliefs and professional relationships\n\nThe inquiry involved Mo watching videos of his lessons with an Assistant Headteacher. He is now much firmer in his belief that:\n\n**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge.\n\n**4.5** Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.\n\n**4.6** Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.\n\n**4.7** High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.\n\n**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve.\n\nWith regard to professional relationships, Mo has also learned that:\n\n**8.3** Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues.\n\n## Self-Study Activities\n\n### Review: 5 mins\n\nRead the case studies on this module’s topics, or the one or two that are most relevant to the evaluative question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:\n\n1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation\n2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you\n3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry\n\n### Plan: 5 mins\n\n#### Action planning\n\nTake a few minutes to plan how you will use your self-directed study time this week. Think about:\n\n- what evidence you already have e.g.\n\n  - the evidence you have been deliberately collecting all along\n  - the counter-evidence i.e. that which might point you to negative outcomes of your inquiry\n\n- what evidence you still need to collect e.g.\n\n  - overhead evidence – you didn’t collect this deliberately, but it was there\n  - unexpected evidence – for outcomes you did not anticipate\n\nSo, this week you might divide your time between collecting this wider evidence and making inferences from it (such as you did in your mentor meeting last week), and analysing the broader impacts of the inquiry on yourself. Remember, the evidence you should look for first is that which is near to hand.\n\n### Theory to practice: 40 mins\n\n#### **1. Practical exercise**\n\nRemember, in your mentor meeting last week, you updated your claim using this matrix.\n\n|                                                                                      |                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Deliberate**                                                                       | **Overheard**                                                                                     |\n| The evidence you collected in a systematic, planned way for outcomes you anticipated | The evidence that fell into your lap, for example chance conversations with colleagues and pupils |\n| **Unexpected**                                                                       | **Counter**                                                                                       |\n| The evidence for outcomes you did not anticipate                                     | The evidence, possibly negative, which sits at odds with your overall claim                       |\n\nIn making ‘reasonable inferences’ keep this in mind:\n\n- know the detail of what you altered in your practice\n- observe the changes in outcomes/ behaviours for your pupils\n- is it fair to infer that the outcomes were caused by the alterations to practice?\n\nSome things you might do to actively collect the wider evidence:\n\n- interview briefly the pupils or colleagues you overheard\n- analyse the data for the outcomes you were not anticipating, e.g. take in another set of books\n- speak to/look again at the work of the pupils who appear not to be progressing in the way you hoped\n\n#### **2. Self-assessment**\n\nEngaging in practitioner inquiry is a powerful form of professional development. It can have a direct impact upon your…\n\n**Practical knowledge** – the fluency with which you use your expanded repertoire\n**Beliefs** – in yourself and your pupils\n**Workload** – by learning to do less of what doesn’t (and more of what does) work\n**Professional relationships** – what you learn from each other\n\nIt is important to recognise the impacts that your inquiry has had on you. Where should you look?\n\n- your Learning Log\n- your Module 8 audit\n- the ECF statements for the standard you have focused on (but look across the ECF too)\n- your colleagues – what have they noticed about how you have developed?\n- take another look at the featured case study teachers – what did they notice about their beliefs, workload and professional relationships?\n\n#### **3. Rehearsal**\n\nNext week your mentor is going to ask you about the impact your inquiry has had on you.\n\nSpend a few minutes this week rehearsing what you are going to say to them.\n\n### Next Steps: 5 mins\n\nBring your self-assessment of the impact upon you of your inquiry to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.\n\nIn that meeting, you will also talk about how you will present your final inquiry findings. Come with your own ideas!\n\n", nil, "c7c43aeb-ac72-4b41-966e-c03e170dea36"]
