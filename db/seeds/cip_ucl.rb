## Introduction

This module focuses on Teachers’ Standards 1 and 7. These can be considered as foundational to your teaching because they address how you set up your classroom as a learning environment. As you work through the weeks of this module you will reflect on the different ways that you can influence your environment, and learn practical strategies that keep pupils safe, motivated and focused on learning.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

$I

<h3>A new year and a fresh start</h3>
Sam is excited – and nervous – about starting a new job in September. At her current
school she is happy: pupils respect and trust her, see her as a role model, and know
that she believes in them.

However, it took Sam a couple of years to reach this point and she knows she made some mistakes along the way. To make the most of her fresh start, Sam’s current mentor suggests that she considers how to communicate her expectations to her new pupils and create a positive learning environment from day one.

What do you think Sam should consider in order to embed expectations early on with her new classes, in order to recreate the respect and trust she had fostered at her old school?
$I

Teachers can be extraordinarily influential – you can improve the motivation, wellbeing and behaviour of your pupils. In turn, this will help you to improve their life chances, especially for the most disadvantaged pupils. Ultimately, the quality of your teaching is what matters most, but creating secure foundations by acting as a role model, clarifying your expectations and creating a culture of trust and respect will help your teaching to have the greatest possible impact. You can do this by:

- **acting as a role model** – your actions can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of your pupils. For instance, modelling a joy of reading may influence your pupils’ attitudes to reading. Therefore, you should be purposeful and consider the attributes you wish to foster through your example. Pupils may be especially impressionable if they identify with you, or if they lack existing positive role models
- **clarifying your expectations** – your expectations of pupils can affect their outcomes. This is sometimes known as the Pygmalion effect, through which pupils can internalise expectations of them held by others. Setting challenging, yet achievable goals will help you to communicate your high expectations and support pupils to achieve more. You should set similar expectations about behaviour by, for instance, not tolerating low-level disruption
- **creating a culture of respect and trust** – this can be achieved by doing lots of simple things well, such as actively modelling and reinforcing the courteous behaviour you expect pupils to show you and their peers. For instance, by respectfully listening to others’ ideas and actively modelling how to do this and why it matters

$I

<h3>A culture of trust and respect</h3>
Just like in Sam’s previous school, the first time she set a collaborative activity
for her new class, she spent time discussing and agreeing with them a set of class
rules aimed at fostering a culture of respect and trust. Rules included ‘listening
carefully to others’ views’ and ‘respecting each other’s views’. Taken together,
the rules that Sam’s class agreed helped to reinforce their shared value about the
importance of fairness.

The rules were similar to those from previous years, but this time Sam paid more attention to the details of how these rules were embedded with the class, having learnt how important this is. For instance, she systematically modelled the rules with her own behaviour, sometimes exaggerating this for effect. Furthermore, Sam reinforced the rules by highlighting successes and reminding pupils consistently of expectations if they violated the rules. As part of reinforcement, Sam also emphasised the positive link between time on task and learning.

Over time, Sam’s pupils began to remind each other about the rules, and the culture of respect and trust helped all pupils to succeed. Notably, it became much easier for Sam to teach and for pupils to learn in these conditions – the initial investment of lesson time was worth it for its overall benefit across the year.
$I

**Routines** are a sequence of actions regularly followed. School life is full of routines and teachers can influence these routines so that they are both effective and efficient – this helps to maximise the time available for learning. Routines can also help create a predictable and secure environment for all pupils, which may be particularly helpful for pupils with special educational needs.

Routines can be helpful in many different situations. These will depend to an extent on your own context. Common situations where routines are useful include:

- **transition points** – moving from one activity to another, especially when physical movement is needed, such as younger pupils moving from working at tables to sitting on the carpet
- **using equipment** – excess time taken in distributing and gathering equipment is time that could be better spent learning, so establishing efficient routines is important here
- **entering and exiting lessons** – simple routines to support entry and exit include the use of seating plans and ‘board activities’ for pupils to begin as soon as they enter the classroom
- **collaborative and paired work** – pupils benefit from clear routines to support them to work effectively and efficiently together. Working with others is most impactful when pupils are clear about how to do this well – for example, having defined roles for each member of a group; clarifying strategies for contributing and listening to ideas within the group; and establishing processes for feeding back outcomes to the class at the end of the task
- **safety** – different subjects pose different risks, but establishing routines, such as how pupils wear goggles in science, can help maintain safety for everybody

**Establishing and maintaining routines,** like any behaviour, takes effort – especially in the early stages of working with a new class. It can be helpful to think of this as a four-stage process; the speed and emphasis placed on each stage will depend on your pupils’ characteristics, your classroom context and the focus of the routine. It may be necessary to re-model or provide further practice if adherence to a given routine decreases over time.

- **clarify** – begin by clarifying exactly what the routine involves and why you are using it. For instance, the aim of the routine may be mainly about maximising time for learning safely
- **model** – show pupils how to perform the routine and explain its purpose, highlighting the core principles or elements of the routine. It can help to show non-examples, that represent common misinterpretations of the routine, as part of this
- **practice** – scaffold opportunities for practice when first using the routine. Including an element of competition may be appropriate here – for example, timing groups of pupils to see who can clear away equipment and be ready to exit the classroom in the least time
- **reinforce** – regularly reinforce the routine by acknowledging when it is done well and providing reminders and further practice where it is not

$I

<h3>Establishing and maintaining a routine for gluing in sheets</h3>
Following her mentor’s advice, Sam spent some time thinking about the routines that
she wanted to establish with her new class. One area where she needed a stronger
routine was gluing sheets into pupils’ books. Initially, Sam thought it might be
too trivial an action to focus on, but on reflection she found that it really did
matter to her.

Too often in the past, this had been a slow process which some pupils did so ineffectively that their books were messy or resources got lost. Sam had even found herself sometimes gluing in sheets when she was marking books, which was a poor use of her time. This time Sam was clear with her new pupils about the routine she wanted to embed:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>clarify</strong> – Sam clarified to pupils how she wanted sheets
    stuck into books: open, not folded; edges inside the book, not hanging out;
    a single line of glue around each edge, not across the whole sheet. Sam then
    thought about the routine pupils needed to embed to achieve this. She
    already kept glue sticks on the table, but she added in a stage of peer
    checking, too
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>model </strong>– Sam explained to pupils why the routine mattered,
    which included showing the class two old exercise books: one where the
    routine had been followed, and one where it had not. Sam also modelled the
    process using her visualiser and a volunteer peer checker, and pointed out
    common mistakes as well as how to avoid these
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>practice</strong> – Sam purposefully built in time for practice
    during the first weeks of term. As she built in peer checking of books it
    naturally became a little competitive and pupils enjoyed trying to glue in
    their sheets both efficiently and effectively
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>reinforce</strong> – the peer checking became a powerful way of
    reinforcing the routine and this also contributed to the wider class culture
    of high expectations. Sam also regularly reinforced the rationale for the
    routine and its link to pupils’ learning. If sheets had not been glued in
    correctly, Sam provided targeted reinforcement of her expectations
  </li>
</ul>
$I

To make the most of your routines, consider the following questions:

- What is the purpose of each routine?
- What – exactly – do you expect to happen during each routine?
- How will you provide sufficient high-quality practice for each routine?
- How will you reinforce each routine?

You could then consider each routine from your pupils’ perspective:

- Do pupils understand the purpose of each routine?
- Do pupils understand, exactly, what to do with each routine?

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

- the practices that you are already doing well
- the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
- the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 15 mins

#### Analyse artefacts / discuss with a colleague

Spend some time exploring the culture and values of your school, then capture what you think are the main features of this culture / these values in a way that suits you. This could be in a short narrative, a bulleted list or a diagram, for example.

To help you, you might:

- read paperwork that outlines your school’s culture and values – for example staff induction documentation or promotional materials (you could also look on your school’s website for this information)
- walk around the building and notice what this tells you about the culture and what is valued. What is on display, and on noticeboards? What is celebrated? How do staff and pupils interact with each other?
- speak to a colleague who has been at the school for a while and ask them what they feel characterises the culture and values of the school

### Theory to practice: 15 mins

#### 1. Observe a colleague

As you have read above, how you set the expectations in your classroom will significantly shape the learning that happens within it. Arrange to observe the beginning (first 5 minutes) of an experienced colleague’s lesson. Make brief notes on all the ways that this colleague communicates their expectations about attitudes, values and behaviour in their classroom. Ask your mentor to suggest a suitable colleague, if necessary.

To shape this observation, you could look out for:

- How the colleague manages entry to the room: how do pupils enter? Do they line up first? Is entry controlled in any way? What happens if pupils are not following expectations?
- What pupils do on entry to the room: do they have a routine for dealing with their bags and outdoor coats? Do they sit down immediately? How quickly do they settle? Is there work or an activity ready for them to get on with?
- How the teacher communicates their expectations verbally and non-verbally: what words do they use? What tone, volume and pitch? How are facial expressions and gestures used to communicate with pupils?
- How the colleague uses aspects of the model described above: clarify; model; practice; reinforce

#### 2. Scripting

**Use the ideas in the research and practice summary above, and your notes from this session so far, to script your own routine for how pupils will enter your classroom. If relevant to your setting, you may want to consider the role of parents and carers as part of this, too.**

Your script should address the ‘clarify’ and ‘model’ stages of the process described in this week’s research and practice summary. Include in this script:

- your expectations about how pupils will enter the room: will they line up? Where? Who decides when pupils enter? What will happen if pupils aren’t following expectations?
- instructions you will give pupils about what to do on entry: how will they deal with bags and coats? Will they sit down immediately? What are your expectations about how quickly they settle? What should pupils ‘do’ once they are settled?
- how you will model your expectations to your pupils
- notes for yourself on how you will create opportunities for pupils to practise your new routine
- notes for yourself on how you will communicate your expectations verbally and non-verbally: what language could you use to greet different pupils? How will you use tone, volume and pitch? How will you use facial expressions and gestures to help reinforce your expectations?

Be as specific as you can in the detail you give. The purpose of this activity is to help you think in detail about how you can set clear expectations about behaviour on entry to your classroom, and create a predictable and secure environment that supports effective learning.

### Next steps: 5 mins

Bring your script and any notes you have made from the other activities in this session to your mentor meeting this week. Be ready to discuss your script with your mentor and work together to refine it further. You will have a chance to rehearse this script with your mentor before putting it into practice in your teaching.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Behaviour in KS3 design technology</h3>
Toby teaches design technology and only teaches each of his Key Stage 3 classes once
per week. Behaviour is especially important in design technology, both for pupils’
learning and their safety.

Toby knows that setting and reinforcing consistently high behavioural expectations is important, but he lacks confidence about how to do this, especially as he does not see his classes very often. This makes it harder to establish effective relationships.

Toby asks a senior colleague, Muhammad, for advice. <strong>What strategies do you think Muhammad might suggest?</strong>

You saw last week how maintaining high expectations, particularly about behaviour, is important. This week you will further examine practical techniques that you can use to do this.

Demonstrating consistently high behavioural expectations can help you to create a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils. Doing this will support pupils’ overall school experience, improving their learning and reducing opportunities for bullying.

To consistently demonstrate high behavioural expectations, you should:

- **create a culture of respect and trust** – this can be achieved by doing lots of simple things well, such as actively modelling and reinforcing the courteous behaviour you expect pupils to show you and their peers. For instance, by respectfully listening to others’ ideas and actively modelling how to do this and why it matters
- **teach and maintain your expectations** – explicitly teaching and reinforcing your expectations is important. Last week, you used the ‘clarify, model, practice, reinforce’ framework to establish routines. You could also apply this to your expectations about behaviour
- **use school policies** – schools typically have detailed policies and procedures, especially relating to rules, sanctions and rewards. Ensure that you understand and apply these policies consistently and fairly. This will support pupils to understand your high expectations, provide predictability and support your colleagues in using the same policies
- **acknowledge pupil effort and progress** – maintaining appropriate behaviour is harder for some pupils than others. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and praise when pupils are making an effort and to try to link this to the progress pupils are making. For instance, ‘Lucy, well done for focusing and settling down to work quickly today. I can see how hard you’re trying to follow the rules. You’re getting faster at this, which means more time for your learning’

$I

<h3>Using school systems and colleagues for support</h3>
As Toby has limited time with each of his classes, it is harder for him to demonstrate
and rigorously reinforce his high behavioural expectations. Muhammad suggested that
it is particularly important for Toby to follow the school’s policies closely, as
this will help pupils more easily transfer what they already know about expectations
of their behaviour to Toby’s lessons.

Muhammad suggested that Toby spend some time using the ‘clarify, model, practice, reinforce’ framework to think about the behaviours that are particularly relevant to design technology. Muhammad worked with Toby to specify, script and rehearse important subject-specific behaviours about safety and listening to instructions, which dramatically improved behaviour and the climate for learning in Toby’s lessons.

Muhammad also clarified key aspects of the school’s behaviour policy with Toby and showed him some tips for ensuring that he followed through with sanctions and rewards using the school system. Muhammad explained that he made a note of behaviour ‘events’ in his planner after each lesson and then spent 10 minutes at the end of each day adding these to the school’s information management system, so that his colleagues could understand and respond to patterns of behaviour for different pupils. Toby saw how this system could work for him and ensure that behaviour, positive and negative, was consistently followed up and reinforced.

Muhammad reassured Toby that it was his job to help him and it was not a sign of weakness for Toby to ask for help – it is part of a being a professional to work collaboratively with colleagues. If Toby needed support, especially with managing disruptive pupils, he knew he could ask for assistance and training from senior colleagues.

Teachers have significant influence over the culture in their classrooms. To maximise learning and pupils’ school experience, you should aim to create a positive, predictable and safe classroom environment. Predictability is especially important for pupils as it helps to reinforce your high expectations of behaviour. A key way of developing this predictability is to consistently apply rules, sanctions and rewards in line with your school’s policy, and to escalate matters as appropriate.

Fairness is an important part of predictability and it is something that pupils are acutely aware of, so focusing on it will help to ensure the legitimacy of your rules and expectations for behaviour.

To create a positive learning environment, you can:

- **be predictable** – schools use sanctions and rewards in many different ways to reinforce desirable behaviours. The success of any system will be determined by its implementation, and predictability is a key part of this. For instance, sanctions that are only enforced sometimes will be less effective than those that always, predictably, follow a certain behaviour. Being predictable helps to reinforce the school’s high expectations of pupils
- **be aware** – awareness is important for preventing low-level disruption as well as for quickly managing bullying or other behaviours that threaten pupils’ emotional safety. To maintain awareness, you should position yourself physically so that you can visually monitor the whole class even when speaking to an individual or small group, and frequently ‘be seen looking’ so that pupils know you are aware of what they are doing
- **be responsive** – responding early to low-level disruption usually helps to shut it down quickly. ‘Least-intrusive’ approaches – i.e. those which limit disruption to learning, including non-verbal signals – can be appropriate at this stage, such as pausing abruptly, moving physically closer to disruptive students, or looking at pupils to show that you know what they are doing and that it is not acceptable (the ‘teacher glare’)

$I

<h3>Responding early using the least-intrusive interventions</h3>
Muhammad invited Toby to come and see one of his own classes where he was working
hard to reinforce positive behaviours. Toby watched intently as Muhammad explained
a key learning point:

‘Victorian society became incre…’

Muhammad paused abruptly – mid-word – and looked calmly and directly at two pupils who had begun to talk to each other. The pupils immediately stopped, refocused, and Muhammad resumed his explanation with minimal disruption to the whole class, having reinforced his high expectations of behaviour.

Toby noted how the abrupt pause instantly got the attention of the disruptive pupils with only minimal interruption to learning. Afterwards he reflected on what he had seen and asked himself, ‘how can I use that approach?’
$I

**Giving instructions** can be challenging for all teachers, as they need to ensure that all pupils understand what is expected of them. Fortunately, the way that instructions are given can ensure more pupils understand them the first time. If pupils misunderstand instructions, this will waste lesson time and can lead to disruptive behaviour. It can also leave pupils feeling excluded and, in some situations, pose a risk to pupils’ safety.

Instructions given to pupils should be:

- **manageable** – pupils’ working memory is limited, so it can help to give instructions both orally and visually. With practical tasks, for instance, you may include a written or visual representation of the method in addition to verbal instructions, which pupils can refer back to and check their understanding
- **sequential** – think about how you sequence instructions so that the right information is given at the right time. Where possible, providing instructions at the point they will be needed is useful. For instance, you can break up instructions for multi-phase activities so that instructions for later phases are only given once pupils have completed earlier phases
- **specific** – ensure pupils understand what exactly it is you expect of them. It can be helpful to consider at the planning stage how your instructions may be misinterpreted (i.e. ‘what could go wrong here?’), and use this to provide the right level of specificity when teaching
- **check understanding** – after giving instructions, it can be helpful to briefly check that pupils understand by asking questions such as, ‘what should you do if/when…?’ This should be given higher priority in the case of complicated instructions and for pupils who frequently struggle to understand instructions
- **consistent** – there are some instructions that you will give often, such as getting the attention of a class to ‘bring them back’ from independent or group work. It can help to use consistent signals for this. For instance, you might use a specific phrase, a countdown or a non-verbal instruction such as raising your hand to gain attention

$I

<h3>Give better instructions</h3>
Giving clear instructions is a really essential part of Toby’s job. After examining
the evidence about clear instructions, Toby gave much more consideration to how he
ensures all pupils understand what he expects.

Toby thought it was particularly important to give clear instructions when pupils were doing practical work, because of both the risks to safety and the potential for difficulty in regrouping and guiding the class as they moved around the workshop.

Toby decided to script out some instructions that he would give ahead of beginning practical work. As he often needed to give instructions like this, he decided having a consistent approach would be useful, and that he could adapt this approach to the context of each lesson. ‘Victorian society became incre…’

<strong>
  Thanks everyone [pause for silence]. Today we are going to [e.g. begin
  painting our birdhouses]. There are [e.g. three] stages to what you need to
  do. I’m now going to show you each of these stages, and you have a summary of
  the key steps showing on the whiteboard to help you along the way.
</strong>

<strong>
  [Show and explain each stage clearly. Link to the summary on the whiteboard.]
  For example:
</strong>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>
      clean your birdhouse to remove any dust so that this does not get stuck in
      the paint [why]. Use the same technique as you can see here [modelling].
      Remember to be careful if your birdhouse has any delicate sections.{" "}
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      {" "}
      prepare your workspace – [further detailed and clear instructions]
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      {" "}
      begin the painting – [further detailed and clear instructions]
    </strong>
  </li>
</ol>
<strong>
  Okay, so that’s what we’re going to do. Before we begin I want to check we
  know what we need to do. It’s important that we are all clear so that we can
  work on this task safely and effectively.
</strong>

<strong>
  [Ask targeted questions to clarify key points from the instructions.] For
  example:
</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Vicky, what can people do to remind themselves if they get stuck?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Louise, why is it important to remove the dust before we paint?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Chris, what are the tricky bits of the task that you’ll need to watch out
      for?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Finally, does anyone have any questions before we begin?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
By carefully structuring his explanations, and building in checking for pupils’
understanding, Toby improved the quality of his explanations, which maximised
the time for safe learning. After thinking more about how to give instructions
effectively, Toby devised the following questions to help:
<ul>
  <li>what are the key things pupils need to understand?</li>
  <li>
    what are the likely misinterpretations and how will I both avoid and check
    for these misunderstandings?
  </li>
  <li>
    should the instructions be given all at once, or will it help to phase them?
  </li>
</ul>

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Read the scenario below. Use this to test and extend your thinking around approaches to establishing the learning environment.

- At each numbered point of the scenario, complete the table at the end of the text, using the information in the research and practice summary above and your learning from last week’s sessions. The first row has been completed as an example of the sort of answers you might give. You will need to copy the table into your notes so you have space to fill it in.
- Once you have completed the activity, review your responses by reading the commentary at the end of this session plan. Update your own responses as necessary.

The scenario has been written so that it can be interpreted in the context of any phase. You should consider the case in the context of your pupils, school context and specialism.

<h3>Managing a smooth start to lessons</h3>
It’s early in the first term of the academic year. You are finding that when pupils
arrive at your classroom, it takes up to 10 minutes for them all to arrive and become
settled and ready to start (1). There are particular pupils who are consistently
the last to arrive at the lesson, by which point you just want to get started in
order to engage the class in their learning (2). The staggered start to the lesson
is eating into important instruction time and creates an unsettled atmosphere, which
you then find difficult to eradicate (3). When you begin the lesson, you find that
there are some pupils who are not focused (e.g. whispering to one another, fidgeting
with equipment and clearly not actively listening) which often means you need to
repeat instructions, explain things again, or have some pupils who are ready to move
on and some who are unable to because they weren’t focused (4). $I

#### 2. Reflection

Having completed the activity above, reflect on how this connects to your own practice and how you can draw on learning from this exercise to improve your approaches to establishing the learning environment.

You might ask yourself:

- which points of the scenario resonate most strongly with your own experience?
- which points of the scenario would you be most/least confident in addressing?
- who in your school could help you develop your practice further in areas covered in this scenario?
- what immediate change can you make in your practice to improve the way that you communicate behavioural expectations and shape your classroom environment?

#### So what could you do in this scenario?

1. Setting out clear expectations at the start of a new year is a powerful way to ensure consistency in your lessons. Decide how you want your lessons to begin – perhaps there is a school policy where all pupils must line up in silence outside the classroom, or perhaps you are allowed to choose how the lesson starts. Identifying a clear expectation which you reinforce every lesson will foster a calm and purposeful start to your lesson.
2. Find out why the pupils are late to your lesson by talking to them calmly, outside of lesson time away from the view of the rest of the class. Consider your school policy on punctuality – apply the appropriate sanction to deal with the late pupils, and continue to do so each time they are late, escalating your response as necessary if this is a repeat occurrence.
3. Preparation is key here. Set the expectation that there will always be the same routine at the start of each lesson. For example, pupils enter quietly and sit at their desk, remove their coats and get their equipment out for the lesson. It may be a good idea to have a task ready for them to engage with immediately, such as a quiz on prior learning, a ‘big question’ that requires deep thought, or perhaps responding to feedback in their exercise books. This will set the tone for a calm and purposeful lesson.
4. Again, this is about ensuring there are clear expectations which you consistently reinforce, ideally through modelling the behaviour you expect from pupils. The example in the research and practice summary of stopping instruction abruptly and looking pointedly at those not listening can be an effective strategy. It would also be appropriate to praise pupils who do conform to your expectations. Furthermore, you may want to reflect on the quality of your explanations – are they sufficiently structured and concise? As with the issue of punctuality, apply your school’s policy in managing the situation, initially aiming for the least-intrusive action but escalating issues as appropriate in line with the policy.

### Next steps: 5 mins

Bring your notes from this activity to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor. Use your learning in this session to make at least one positive change to how you establish the learning environment in your lessons over the coming week.

## Introduction

You have already learnt how teachers can have a dramatic effect on pupils’ success at school and their later life chances, particularly for the most disadvantaged pupils. This week you will see how teachers can influence wider outcomes, which are important both in their own right and because they are associated with long-term success in education. This includes self-regulation, motivation and resilience.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Observations and conclusions</h3>
After another difficult Year 8 geography lesson, Amy is concerned about her pupils.
She hoped that her enthusiasm for geography would quickly develop pupils’ love of
learning geography, but this does not seem to be happening.

Amy has decided that as some pupils seem unwilling to complete challenging activities, she needs to make her lessons more exciting in order to appeal to them. After their first end-of-topic assessment had disappointing results, Amy concluded that her pupils must lack motivation to learn. She decided to explore ways to improve their motivation.

Amy’s mentor challenges Amy to more clearly separate out what she observes in her pupils’ behaviours and the conclusions she draws about why they behave in this way. The mentor cautions Amy against drawing unfounded conclusions about pupils’ experiences, as she has done here, and reminds her that there are many plausible explanations for why pupils behave as she is observing.

<strong>
  What might be going on for Amy’s pupils in the situations she is experiencing?
  What factors might be behind what Amy is observing in her class? What
  strategies might she use to engage her pupils more effectively in their
  learning?

**Self-regulation** refers to a pupil’s ability to monitor, evaluate and modify their emotions and behaviours. This includes, for example, controlling emotions of anger, frustration or embarrassment – all common emotions experienced by pupils across their school career. The most effective learners are able to effectively regulate their own emotions, meaning they are better able to learn well, and to form positive relationships with others. If pupils struggle with this it can affect their own learning and future lives and may also negatively affect their peers.

The Education Endowment Foundation report that – on average – pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and lower-attaining pupils, are less effective at self-regulation than their peers. Therefore, explicitly teaching self-regulation may be particularly beneficial for these pupils.

Pupils’ self-regulation depends on their prior knowledge and their stage of development. However, developing pupils’ self-regulation is as important for early years practitioners as for teachers of older pupils – especially as it relates to the regulation of emotions, which supports successful learning.

Approaches to developing pupils’ emotional self-regulation include:

- using story books and discussing how characters may feel and why
- developing pupils’ vocabulary to describe their emotions
- teaching self-calming techniques, like deep breathing
- supporting pupils to recognise their own body clues linked to strong emotions, like a changing tone of voice, hot face and increased heart rate

**Resilience** refers to the ability to cope with and overcome challenges. Supporting pupils to overcome challenging goals, and understand the connection between effort and success, can support the development of resilience. Meeting goals that are not sufficiently challenging or where pupils do not have to work hard is unlikely to develop resilience.

Resilience is linked to pupils’ beliefs about their **ability to succeed** – they are more likely to persist in the face of challenge or adversity if they believe that they will, eventually, achieve their goal. An important way that teachers can influence their pupils’ beliefs in this area is to create regular opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success. ‘Meaningful success’ could mean different things to different pupils – for some it will be working through a tricky activity on their own; others may value answering questions correctly in front of their peers. Where challenge is too low, success is unlikely to be meaningful. Challenge is a function of the learning goal of the lesson and the degree of support available to help reach this goal.

### To help all of your pupils experience meaningful success on a regular basis, and develop resilience, you should:

- pitch the learning goals of your lessons to be challenging enough for pupils that success has meaning (i.e. that it’s not too easy to succeed), but not so challenging that success seems out of reach
- adapt the level of support, or scaffolding, available to all pupils – including both lower and higher attainers. This will help all pupils to master the challenge in the lesson, with sufficient effort to make success meaningful, and learn what you want them to learn
- consider the range of activities in your lessons and how these play to your pupils’ respective strengths – if some pupils are more able to express their ideas orally than in writing, for example, exploit opportunities for them to ‘succeed’ through discussion at the same time as you work to develop their written literacy
- be specific in your use of praise so that it is clear to pupils when and how they are ‘succeeding’ (e.g. ‘that was an excellent answer because…’ or ‘what an improvement since last week. You’ve really improved your…’)
- praise pupils’ attitude and effort as well as outcomes of their work – emphasise the importance of learning behaviours that lead to success in the longer term

<h3>Supporting pupils’ resilience and beliefs about success</h3>
Amy reflected on her mentor’s feedback and decided to explore her pupils’ behaviour
some more. She observed them with another teacher and was impressed at how engaged
the class was in their learning, but she also noticed that many of the class seemed
to ‘give up’ when they found some more difficult activities quite challenging. This
led Amy to reflect on where the pupils might be struggling.

Amy has decided that she needs to develop pupils’ resilience, so that they are more able to keep going with suitably challenging learning activities. After learning more about how teachers can develop pupils’ resilience, Amy decides that the first thing she needs to do is to pitch the learning goals appropriately. The school’s Year 8 geography curriculum is insufficiently challenging for some of Amy’s pupils so she plans ways to raise the challenge for these pupils.

Next, Amy reviews the support that she gives to pupils. After reviewing pupils’ exercise books, Amy observes a group who seldom complete activities in full and often make quite significant errors in their work. Their exercise books are covered in red pen and points for improvement. Putting herself in these pupils’ shoes, Amy understands how rarely they must experience success in her class. Amy resolves to more effectively scaffold learning for these pupils and create opportunities for them to feel successful in their learning

Amy is already confident with how she uses praise – especially when it comes to praising effort and perseverance. Even so, Amy realises that she could be more specific with some of her praise and compare what pupils are doing now with what they have previously done to highlight improvements.

Together, these new approaches will help to develop pupils’ resilience and self-belief, which will help all pupils experience meaningful success.
$I

**Motivation** is important for pupils’ success at school and later life chances. It is usually defined as a kind of driving force that influences the selection, direction, and continuation or discontinuation of behaviours.

It can be helpful to think of two types of motivation: intrinsic motivation, related to pupils’ identity and values; and extrinsic motivation, related to reward and sanctions. Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyse one’s capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge. It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in a goal or task, and derives from the individual rather than relying on external implementation. Pupils who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in learning willingly, as well as work to improve their knowledge, skills and performance. Conversely, extrinsic motivation refers to behaviour that is driven by external factors such as grades, praise or the avoidance of punishment.

Some forms of extrinsic motivation can very powerfully influence pupil behaviour, but it may also have undesirable consequences if pupils focus too much on the competition, and on ‘winning’ at the expense of intended learning. For example, pupils who rush to finish work ‘first’ may not think as carefully about their learning as they would if they were less motivated by the reward offered for speed.

In any scenario pupils will be influenced by both types of motivation, but developing pupils’ intrinsic motivation linked to learning will support their success because they will engage more willingly in their learning without the need for external validation.

It is important to recognise that motivation is not visible, and that it is easy to make assumptions about the motivations behind pupil behaviours that may not be correct. It is helpful to remain mindful of the difference between observable actions and hypotheses about the drivers of these actions. For example, a pupil who appears ‘lazy’ may in fact by struggling to focus because of events happening outside school in their family or friendship group, or because the work they are completing is not sufficiently challenging.

### To increase pupils’ motivation, you can support them to:

- **master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals** – success is motivating, especially when it is challenging to achieve and links with pupils’ long-term goals. For instance, accurately and judiciously using challenging, technical vocabulary in writing will motivate an aspiring journalist
- **explore their long-term goals** – whether or not they articulate them freely, most pupils have long-term goals. However, there is often a mismatch between these goals and what pupils think they need to do to achieve them. Discussing long-term goals with pupils and linking this to their learning can be highly motivational. For instance, you may be able to make connections between pupils’ goals and their current learning that they are not aware of such as between the digestive system in biology and a pupil interested in becoming a chef. You might also highlight to pupils the value of transferable skills that they are developing, and where qualifications are a prerequisite to the career path that they wish to follow
- **develop intrinsic motivation** – extrinsic motivation can be a very powerful driver, but it is not always sustainable for pupils in the long term – into adulthood – because it relies on an external source of reward and sanction. You should help your pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation towards having the intrinsic motivation to work without external input. As well as supporting pupils to master challenging content and connect learning to personal goals, you can help them to find interest and enjoyment in their studies. For instance, by demonstrating your own enthusiasm for what you are teaching, or through the pedagogical approaches you use

$I

<h3>Motivating reluctant learners</h3>
Much of what Amy is now doing will help to increase her pupils’ motivation as well
as their resilience and self-belief. As pupils experience meaningful success more
often, they will likely experience increased motivation, too.

Like Amy, many teachers think that improving the motivation of pupils who are struggling will improve their learning. In fact, it often works in reverse – improving pupils’ learning improves their motivation.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 15 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim both to refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. **Reflection**

Use the research and practice summary for this week to reflect on the pupils you teach. If you teach more than one class, choose just one as the focus for this activity.

As you review your pupils, consider these questions:

- how would you describe this class overall in terms of their resilience, self-regulation and motivation? Try to be clear about (a) what you can observe and (b) the conclusions you draw from these observations
- what variation exists within the class? Are there pupils who present quite differently to their peers? What implications might this have for teaching and learning?
- What groups are there within the class in which pupils have similar characteristics relating to resilience, self-regulation and motivation? How might this influence your approaches to teaching this group?

#### 2. **Practical exercise**

Now select two pupils from the class who especially interest you. You might want to focus on one who you feel is particularly flourishing and one about whom you have some more concerns. Write a short description of each pupil. The purpose of this activity is to encourage you to consider in some detail how your pupils vary as individuals and how this has implications for your teaching.

As you draft each description:

- think about what you have observed about this pupil in relation to their resilience, self-regulation and motivation
- include relevant information that you know about the pupil – such as details they have told you about themselves, or which you have gained from liaising with parents, carers and/or colleagues
- include hypotheses about how what you observe and know influences the pupil as a learner
- consider how this pupil may experience learning in your class. For example, to what extent do they have the opportunity to experience meaningful success? Are they able to express their long-term goals and see how their learning helps to work towards these goals?

#### 3. **Independent planning**

Use your learning from this session so far to identify opportunities for you to intervene in meaningful ways with one or more of your pupils to influence positively their resilience, self-regulation and motivation. Make a note of these strategies, which could be targeted at an individual, group or whole-class level.

You will review and develop these strategies in your mentor meeting this week in preparation for trying them out in your teaching.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your descriptions and notes from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss your ideas for intervening with pupils with your mentor.

## Introduction

This week is a chance to revisit some of the concepts you studied earlier in this module, now that you have had more time with your pupils. This time in the school year is often tricky in terms of behaviour, so this week provides an opportunity to return to how you maintain your high standards of behaviour and respond appropriately to disruption.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Overcoming a difficult few weeks</h3>
James started in his new school in September. He is delighted with how effectively
he has established his high expectations and how well pupils have responded to these.

However, as the October half-term approaches, James is increasingly aware that some of his expectations are being challenged by pupils. His mentor reassures him that this is very common and that it matters how he responds – this is an important opportunity for James to reinforce and maintain the strong start that he has made.

<strong>
  What should James think about to reinforce and maintain the high expectations
  he has established?
</strong>
$CTA

You have already learnt about how to effectively establish your expectations. You saw how you can use the following four stages to establish and maintain routines and expectations for behaviour:

- **clarify** – begin by clarifying exactly what the routine involves and why you are using it. For instance, the aim of the routine about handing out equipment quickly may be mainly about maximising time for learning safely
- **model** – show pupils how to perform the routine and explain its purpose. It can help to show non-examples that represent common misinterpretations of the routine as part of this. For example, you can show how just one person in a pair should gather equipment in a science lesson, to minimise the number of people moving around the room
- **practice** – scaffold opportunities for practice when first using the routine. Including an element of competition may be appropriate here. For example, challenging pupils to hand out books as quickly and quietly as possible at the start of the lesson
- **reinforce** – regularly reinforce the routine by acknowledging when it is done well and providing reminders and further practice when it is not. This may be as simple as, ‘well done for settling down and beginning so quickly, Matthew – you’re already learning now’

Using this approach will help you to demonstrate your high expectations of pupils. However, you are likely now reaching the stage where careful reinforcement of your expectations is needed. It is natural for pupils to test the boundaries of your expectations, so it is important to manage your response to this well.

It can help to distinguish between situations where pupils are actively testing your boundaries and situations where pupils do not fully understand what you expect. Where pupils do not understand, re-modelling and practising are likely to be beneficial. In other situations you will need to consider how you reinforce your expectations.

To continue to reinforce your high expectations, as explored in week 3 of this module, it can help to.

- **be predictable** – schools use sanctions and rewards in many different ways to reinforce desirable behaviours. The success of any system will be determined by its implementation, and predictability is a key part of this. For instance, sanctions that are only enforced sometimes will be less effective than those that always, predictably, follow a certain behaviour. Being predictable helps to reinforce your school’s high expectations of pupils
- **be aware** – awareness is important for preventing low-level disruption as well as for quickly managing bullying or other behaviours that threaten pupils’ emotional safety. To maintain awareness, you should position yourself physically so that you can visually monitor the whole class even when speaking to an individual or small group, and frequently ‘be seen looking’ so that pupils know you are aware of what they are doing
- **be responsive** – responding early to low-level disruption usually helps to shut it down quickly. ‘Least-intrusive’ approaches – i.e. those which limit disruption to learning, including non-verbal signals – can be appropriate at this stage, such as pausing abruptly, moving physically closer to disruptive students, or looking at pupils to show that you know what they are doing and that it is not acceptable (the ‘teacher glare’)
- **review your expectations** – you will have set your expectations with the best of intentions, but it may be appropriate to carefully review them if pupils are struggling to do as you wish. You should avoid lowering your expectations, but it may be helpful to alter routines to make these expectations more achievable.

Building effective, trusting relationships with pupils will help you to manage behaviour and create an environment that supports learning. This process will take longer to establish with some pupils than others and this is quite normal, especially if you are a secondary school teacher who sees individual pupils less frequently. It is easier to build these relationships when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood – even though you are ‘in charge’ of your classroom, you are also modelling how to develop and maintain positive relationships, and taking account of others’ feelings is, of course, an important part of this. This does not mean that you always have to do as pupils wish, but that you can positively impact your relationship with pupils by acknowledging their feelings and being clear about the reasons for the decisions you take.

Responding consistently to pupil behaviour is important for two reasons:

- **reinforcing expectations** – if you only sometimes reinforce your expectations in how you use sanctions and rewards, then pupils quickly learn that your expectations are optional. Over time, you will likely find that pupils adhere less and less to your high behavioural expectations
- **fairness** – pupils have a strong sense of fairness, so if they notice (or perceive) they are being treated differently than their peers this can undermine your relationship with them. Therefore, it is important to ‘be fair’ and to ‘be seen to be fair’. This can include, for example, using least-intrusive interventions (see week 3 of Module 1) so that pupils don’t feel that they are being singled out in front of their peers, and linking your use of rewards and sanctions to the school behaviour policy. By being explicit like this, you make it clear to pupils why they are being sanctioned and others know what they need to do to achieve the rewards that their peers receive.

$I

<h3>Setting pupils up to succeed: consistency and persistence</h3>
James was coming to dread his Friday afternoon lessons. It seemed that pupils could
sense the weekend coming and were especially tricky to teach at this time. He felt
that two pupils in particular consistently caused low-level disruption that affected
everyone’s learning, and were frequently off task. This upset James as he had worked
so hard to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment in which all pupils
could thrive.

James asked his mentor to come and observe the class so that she could help James plan how best to tackle the problems he was concerned about.

The feedback from James’ mentor was surprisingly helpful. Not only did she offer some strategies for addressing the pupils’ low-level disruption, but she also highlighted the approaches that James had embedded that were supporting the majority of pupils to learn well – even on a Friday afternoon!

James had taken the time in September to carefully clarify, model, practise and reinforce the behaviours he expected from pupils, and his mentor could see that this was already paying off. She praised the way that he reinforced positive behaviours from pupils, and how he linked this to the school’s policy on sanctions and rewards. She highlighted to James that he was already doing lots of things well and could feel proud of this.

James’s mentor also suggested some strategies to work on. She felt that the disruption worrying James was stemming from the two pupils not always understanding clearly what they needed to do. This helped James to see that the most effective behaviour management strategy in this situation was not to respond to the disruption once it had happened, but to pre-empt it by making sure the pupils understood clearly what they should be doing.

Based on this feedback, James set himself the following targets:

<ol>
  <li>
    target the two pupils with clarification questions when giving task
    instructions, to make sure that they fully understand expectations from the
    outset
  </li>
  <li>
    focus on using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common
    directions in the classroom, so that he can more easily remind the pupils of
    his expectations while they are working. This includes a non-verbal ‘shhh’
    gesture for when they get chatty, which James can use without distracting
    other pupils
  </li>
</ol>
James’ situation is not unique – all teachers experience these kinds of challenges
from time to time, especially less experienced teachers. By consistently and persistently
applying the principles you have learnt in this module, you will be able to address
these challenges and support all pupils to learn well in your class. Remember that
you are not alone in this endeavour and that you can expect assistance and support
from colleagues, which can often make all the difference. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim both to refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Practical exercise

In last week’s self-study session you wrote vignettes about two of your pupils. This week you are asked to write a vignette about your own practice, in which you ‘catch yourself doing something right’ – in this case, a situation in which you managed behaviour effectively. As you saw above, it can be easy as a new teacher to focus on what isn’t yet going well, but remember that you have many successes each day. It is as important to build on and sharpen your strengths as it is to address areas of relative weakness. Celebrate this example of your successful use of strategies for managing behaviour.

To help you write this vignette, you could:

- describe the general situation – who was there, what was the broad setting
- describe what you did
- describe what happened
- try and connect your actions to their consequences, using the ideas in this week’s research and practice summary and those from previous weeks in Module 1

$I

<h3>Example: tricky behaviour in Year 10 computing</h3>
‘My Year 10 computing class can be tricky, particularly after lunch as lots of them
play football during the break and arrive hot and excitable. Often I struggle to
get them to settle and this can ‘blow up’ into confrontation with some pupils who
often accuse me of picking on them. Recently I have been starting the lesson with
a quiet, independent, writing task so that pupils have a chance to cool down before
moving to computers. I used the entry routine that I’ve been practising for a few
weeks and this seemed to help them anticipate what would be happening. I can see
that they’re getting more used to my expectations and this is helping them to calm
down more quickly. A couple of pupils were being a bit chatty but I used physical
proximity (walking casually towards the pupils) as a first reminder of my expectations
and then a quiet 1:1 word with one of them when a second prompt was needed. I phrased
my reminder as ‘you need to be working quietly on this task’ rather than ‘stop talking’
so that I was emphasising my expectations positively. By using strategies consistently
with all pupils I seem to be reducing some of the initial perceptions of unfairness,
so there are fewer incidences where pupils feel they’re being picked on. I am pleased
that my consistency and tenacity seems to be paying off with this class.’ $I

In this vignette you can see that there are strategies in use both to pre-empt disruptive behaviour (planning of activities, use of predictable routines, clear expectations) and also to respond to disruptive behaviour as it arises (early and low-level interventions). These are contributing to a predictable, secure environment in which behaviour is managed effectively.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### **1. Practical exercise**

Now that you have identified where you are making successful use of strategies for managing behaviour, write a vignette that captures a specific situation that you found tricky in relation to managing behaviour. This could be about an individual pupil, a group or a whole class.

As above:

- describe the general situation – who was there, what was the broad setting
- describe what happened
- describe what you did (before, during and after the event)
- try and connect your actions to their consequences, using the ideas in this week’s research and practice summary and those from previous weeks in Module 1

All teachers have bad days, or situations within a day which they would prefer to have managed differently. It is important that you are able to reflect on events like these so that you learn from them and plan ahead for how you will use different approaches when you encounter something similar in the future.

#### 2. **Reflection**

Using your two vignettes, reflect on how you could have taken actions before, during and perhaps after the second event to change the course of the situation. Visualise this event happening differently because you put different strategies in place before it happened and as it unfolded. Use this reflection to write a checklist for yourself of how you will approach tricky behaviour management situations in the future.

To help you write this checklist you could:

- note how you can ‘design out’ poor behaviour through the use of routines, consistent language and the development of a supportive, predictable classroom environment
- note how you can respond to poor behaviour quickly, consistently and with as little intrusion as possible
- note how you can reset relationships and expectations after an incident of poor behaviour

#### 3. **Independent planning**

Now that you have worked through the contents of Module 1, you have the opportunity for your mentor to complete a developmental lesson observation of you putting your learning into practice. Begin to think about a lesson next week that you would value your mentor’s feedback on, and a specific focus from Module 1 topics that would most support your learning.

Make some initial notes about this lesson and a possible observation focus. You will have the opportunity to discuss this lesson further in your next ECT mentor meeting.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your vignettes, your checklist and notes from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss your learning with your mentor.

## Introduction

In the Week 1 meeting with your mentor, you worked through the Module 2 ECT audit, reflecting on your current knowledge and practice in relation to Module 2 of the ECF and agreeing on areas for particular focus in relation to Module 2. You should pay specific attention to these areas as you work through the module sessions.

In this first self-study session, you will look at the impact of pupils’ prior knowledge on their learning (2.1, 2.2) and how knowledge changes through the cooperation of working and long-term memory (2.3). Information in working memory about a current activity (2.4) is linked to things pupils already know that are stored in long-term memory (2.5). You will work through an illustrative exercise to examine how prior knowledge in long-term memory is used to help reduce working memory load (2.4) and create new knowledge. This then provides the basis for further learning (3.5). You will also look at how weak, inaccurate or misapplied prior knowledge can have a negative effect on subsequent performance and learning (2.6, 3.4).

You should apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Drawing on long-term memory to support working memory in Year 9 English</h3>
Hasan is teaching Macbeth to a Year 9 English class of mixed attainment. He wants
his pupils to be able to explain the likely impact upon an Elizabethan audience of
witches appearing on stage in Act IV Scene 1. They studied the Witch Craze in history
last year, and they met Macbeth’s witches in Act 1 earlier this term.

<strong>
  How might Hasan prompt knowledge of witches from his pupils’ long-term
  memories to support their achievement of this learning objective?
</strong>
$CTA

**Knowledge** can be defined as familiarity, awareness or understanding of facts, information or skills. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject). Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: attention, perception, communication and reasoning; this can happen through experience or education.

If a pupil has a poor store of prior knowledge in their long-term memory (i.e. if they are a novice), they are likely to struggle to acquire new knowledge in lessons because their grasp of foundational concepts will not be secure and their working memory can become overloaded.

$I
Hasan suspects that some of his pupils have poor or inaccurate knowledge of attitudes towards witches in the Jacobean period. What techniques could Hasan use to get a better idea of where pupils’ inaccuracies lie?

At the end of the previous lesson, Hasan did some quick-fire true/false questioning to quiz his pupils on their prior knowledge in their long-term memories and to bring misconceptions to the surface (e.g. ‘Witches lived in England in the past. True or false?’, ‘People believed witches conspired with the devil and had the power to change events. True or false?’).
$I

**Learning** can be described as a lasting change in pupils’ capacities or understanding. Sometimes learning is defined as a change in long-term memory; a wider definition of learning might include changes in knowledge, values and attitudes.

Memory is an important factor in learning. Memory comprises two elements: working memory and long-term memory. The role of a teacher is to organise teaching so that it best supports pupils to process information in their working memory and store it within increasingly complex mental models in their long-term memory.

Regular, purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.

To help your pupils to learn more effectively, you should:

- build in opportunities for regular, purposeful practice of what has been learned (e.g. by getting into the habit of building practice time into all of your lessons. Practice can be done singly, in pairs or in larger groups)
- help your pupils strengthen their long-term memories (e.g. for factual recall, by quizzing them to recall recent learning, and repeating this with longer intervals; for practical skills like catching or drawing, you can space their practice over a period of time)
- anticipate misconceptions that are common within the areas you teach and develop ways of catching and correcting these (e.g. by using a series of focused multiple choice questions to identify common misconceptions; the nature of incorrect answers can inform your teaching, so these questions are sometimes called diagnostic questions)

An example of a common scientific misconception is that the seasons are caused by the Earth moving closer to the sun. A good diagnostic question would include this as a plausible incorrect answer alongside the correct answer. Misconceptions are inevitably subject specific. Therefore, discussing with experienced colleagues typical misconceptions, ways of identifying them and overcoming them will support your development as a teacher.

**Working memory** is where information that is being actively processed is held. ‘Active processing’ can be thought of as being synonymous with ‘thinking’. The capacity of the working memory is limited, and it can be overloaded. (This is referred to as Cognitive Load.)

Information can enter the working memory either from the immediate environment or from the long-term memory. Having knowledge stored in the long-term memory therefore helps pupils overcome the limits of their working memory, allowing them to concentrate on the task in hand. Simply put: prior knowledge held in the long-term memory helps reduce working memory load. This enables pupils to think more efficiently using their working memory and to avoid cognitive overload.

To help your pupils avoid cognitive overloading their working memory, you can:

- take account of your pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (e.g. in the previous week, do a quick diagnostic assessment using mini whiteboards or do some true/false questioning)
- break complex material into smaller steps (e.g. use partially completed examples to focus pupils on each specific step)
- reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. removing unnecessary animation or images from a PowerPoint slide or simplifying and sequencing instructions so that they are clearly and logically stated)
- remind pupils of what they have already been taught and how the new information that they are being introduced to relates to this (e.g. by explicitly comparing content in the current lesson to that in past lessons)

<h3>What did Hasan do?</h3>
In today’s lesson, Hasan set up table discussions with these two questions: Why did
people believe in witches in the 16th century? What did people believe about a witch’s
powers? He took feedback from table captains. This helped Hasan to gain a closer
understanding of his pupils’ knowledge. He was also able to correct misconceptions
in their long-term memories at this stage.

To prompt knowledge from their long-term memories (from earlier this term), Hasan then posed a series of short-answer questions for the pupils to answer and show on their mini-whiteboards. For example: How many witches appear in Macbeth? In which Act do they first appear? Who do they tell their prophecy to? Who saw the witches? How did the characters in the play react to the witches?

Hasan has now freed up space in his pupils’ working memories to work on the main task, which is about audience reaction to the witches. He shows them a Globe Theatre video about features of Elizabethan theatre, such as male casting, lighting, sound effects and being open to the elements. He then models for them what a good outcome might look like, identifying key features. Individual pupils write a first draft in this lesson, ready for some peer assessment and redrafting next lesson.

This lesson explicitly links what the pupils have learned longer ago and more recently to what they need to work on now. Hasan took 5 minutes from a previous lesson to check misconceptions in their long-term memories using true/false questions. In the main lesson, he used table discussion and short-answer questions with mini-whiteboards to bring to the surface the knowledge from their long-term memories and to free up space in their working memories. He then used a model to scaffold their writing and will use the next lesson to provide instant feedback through peer assessment.

<strong>
  Which of these strategies is Hasan likely to find useful in aiding his pupils’
  working memories?

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet which, if any, of the practices in Hasan’s lesson that you could adopt in your own

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Think about the following story, which is about the interplay of long-term and working memory. What might be happening mentally at each point:

1. Bob is introduced to the parts of a cell in Year 7 biology. His teacher explains what each part does, what they look like and where they are found in plants.
2. The next day, Bob applies what he learnt about cells to some questions about different types of specialised cells and finds this relatively straightforward. He understands why they are found in the leaves of plans, but not in the roots.
3. Two weeks later, Bob’s teacher asks him what chloroplasts are. Initially, Bob struggles to recall what they are, but with a prompt from his teacher that they are green, Bob is able to recall what he previously learnt about chloroplasts.

This exercise is designed to provide a concrete example of how working memory and prior knowledge in long-term memory work together to create learning.

During the first lesson, Bob is introduced to new content. As he thinks hard about the content, he begins to encode it into his long-term memory. The following day, he is able to easily recall the new information, especially with the prompts from his notes. Again, as he works through the problems, he strengthens the links between his new learning and his prior knowledge about plants.

After two weeks, Bob initially struggles to recall the information, as it is no longer in his working memory. The prompt word chloroplast is not enough by itself to retrieve the information that he previously encoded in his long-term memory. When his teacher reminds him that chloroplasts are green, this is a sufficient prompt to enable Bob to recall from his long-term memory the things that he previously learnt.

In your own teaching, you may well have encountered circumstances where some pupils actually perform more poorly the second time they encounter a particular type of exercise.

- How far might this be explained by the sequence described above?
- How might you use checks on prior knowledge and practice work to reduce this?

To check on their prior knowledge, the second time they encounter a particular exercise, you could:

- do a quick quiz of their previous learning -- you could reuse the same exercise or one which is similar
- in pairs, get your pupils to rehearse ‘everything they remember’ about the prior exercise
- give a quick recap of what they ought to have learned and follow up with one or two multiple-choice questions
- ‘correct the teacher’ – deliberately quote to them the likely misconception and challenge the class to point out your mistake

These activities also have the added benefit of securing knowledge in long-term memory. You will also make use of the same scenario in week 4 of this module.

You will revisit some of these points in your next mentor meeting.

#### 2. Independent planning

Consider your lesson plans for the forthcoming week and identify one context where you can try to make deliberate use of the relationship between working memory and long-term memory, similar to the kinds illustrated by the activity above and in Hasan’s lesson about Macbeth’s witches:

- identify the lesson or part of a lesson which you will focus on
- write a simple plan for how you will make use of your learning about the relationship between working memory and long-term memory in this lesson or part of a lesson
- annotate your plan to show why you have designed it in this way, including where you anticipate pupils’ misconceptions, and discuss these with your mentor when you show them your plan; where you can, connect your annotations to the Research and Practice Summary above

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your planning from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor, including raising any questions that have come to mind while completing this task.

## Introduction

In this session, you will learn about or review your understanding of the foundations underpinning literacy development of pupils in England. An understanding of the foundations of literacy learning is key to teaching pupils of any age. No teacher can help their pupils to access or demonstrate learning without considering their literacy needs: every teacher is a literacy teacher.

You will need to read the Research and Practice Summary before speaking to and/or arranging to observe a colleague to consider an aspect of literacy development. There are many aspects of literacy development which you could choose to focus on, reflected in the learning intentions for this session. Choose one (or more, if you are more confident) which you would like to develop your understanding of for today’s session having looked back at the self-evaluation audit you completed at the start of this module. Reflect on your learning from this session ahead of your next mentor meeting and be prepared to discuss and identify possible next steps for your practice.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Every teacher is a teacher of literacy</h3>
As you read this summary, consider your own pupils in your school. You will also
follow real-life examples from two other teachers. Imogen teaches Year 3 in a primary
school in Greater Manchester. Tom is a teacher for children with language and communication
needs in a special school in north London. $I

Children who have good written and spoken literacy skills are able to engage with their school’s curriculum and experience success as a result. For these reasons, developing pupils’ literacy is perhaps the most important aspect of education for schools to focus on.

The development of early literacy is especially important. This involves the development of two capabilities: word reading and language comprehension. Using systematic, synthetic phonics is the most effective way of developing decoding, which supports word reading. A wide range of approaches, including high quality discussion, will develop pupils’ language capabilities.

Once pupils have mastered phonics and are able to accurately decode, the emphasis should shift towards developing reading fluency. Pupils at this stage in their development can be identified by listening to them read. They will be able to read accurately, but they will be slow and their reading will not sound like speech and may sound disjointed. Developing reading fluency is usually a priority for pupils in KS2 and for a smaller number of pupils in KS3. Developing reading fluency requires extensive practice, but teachers can support this by modelling fluent reading, providing feedback on fluency and providing opportunities for repeated reading with a focus on developing fluency.

In the past, it has been argued that teaching literacy skills is limited to English lessons. This is false. All subjects and teachers have the opportunity and responsibility to develop pupils’ literacy capabilities. This does not mean teaching English during other subjects. Rather, it involves the development of disciplinary literacy, which is the development of reading, writing and oral language skills specific to each discipline.

To improve your pupils’ literacy, you should:

- explicitly teach the reading, writing and oral language skills specific to the discipline or phase you work in (this includes writing in different genres, reading for interpretation, speaking collaboratively)
- deliberately plan the teaching of unfamiliar vocabulary (e.g. by playing word games, matching words with definitions, displaying key vocabulary on the wall)
- regularly expose your pupils to vocabulary which is high-utility and high-frequency and give them repeated practice (e.g. by using keyword tablemats and by modelling the vocabulary in your expositions)
- model for your pupils how they can plan, draft and edit different types of writing specific to your subject or phase (e.g. by ‘live-writing’ a model answer on the whiteboard or using a visualiser to ‘live-model’ the editing process.)

**Reading comprehension** is a complex process involving word reading and language understanding. Word reading involves decoding or breaking down parts of a word by phoneme and blending these together to read the whole word. Reading comprehension means being able to read a section or an entire piece of text and understand its meaning. To make sense of a text, the reader draws on background knowledge, vocabulary, grammatical understanding and their ability to make inferences about meaning based on these.

To help you to develop your pupils’ reading comprehension, you should:

- teach the skills of predicting, questioning, clarifying and summarising text (e.g. through live modelling or by allotting different ‘reading for...’ roles in group reading)
- ‘think out loud’ when reading to help pupils to internalise strategies to help when reading independently
- support pupil engagement and reading for pleasure (e.g. by reading with the whole class high-quality texts that you or they have chosen)

<h3>How Imogen teaches Reading Comprehension, Year 3</h3>
Imogen is working with a group of Year 3 pupils on reading comprehension, building
on strategies she has previously introduced. She has split the group into 4, each
with a defined role. Tahir is the questioner: he will generate comprehension questions
from the page of text to ask to the rest of the group. Poppy is the summariser: she
will sum up each paragraph/ page for the rest of the group précising the text. Sam
is the clarifier: he will identify any vocabulary that needs to be defined. And Sarika
is the predictor: her role is to predict the next action in the story. The pupils
are all familiar with their roles, as this is a strategy that has been modelled for
them regularly and the roles are swapped around; Imogen's role is to listen and provide
direction if they struggle with any aspects. Today, Imogen is going to read the text
aloud as the pupils take their roles; in this way, she will model how a fluent reader
uses volume, tone, expression and modulation when they read – recognising that spoken
language underpins the development of reading and writing.

This is likely to be effective because the pupils are familiar with this form of collaborative learning; Imogen has already spent time establishing and reinforcing routines, such as taking turns. The lesson develops pupils’ capabilities in questioning, summarising, clarifying and predicting – collectively known as reading comprehension strategies. By allowing her pupils to practise these 4 strategies that good readers use automatically as they read and understand texts, Imogen supports pupils’ ability to comprehend texts independently in the future. Because this is a habitual part of Imogen’s teaching, her pupils are now familiar with all of the roles, although they may still find some harder than others. Modelling fluent reading also supports pupils’ comprehension of the texts.
$I

**Oral language** skills (or classroom talk) refer to the use of vocabulary and the quality of discussion by pupils as well as teachers. Encouraging pupils to use specific vocabulary and terminology during discussion in class helps to normalise and embed new words and improve the development of deep understanding. It broadens pupils’ vocabularies and helps them to articulate high-level ideas. Spoken language underpins both reading and writing development. Because modelling and requiring high-quality pupil talk underpins the development of reading and writing, it positively affects academic attainment across the curriculum and children’s social and emotional development.

To help develop quality oral language, you should:

- carefully consider how ground rules and pupil reflection can help build a supportive environment for talk (e.g. circle time is a good opportunity for developing such rules) -- a useful rule to consider is the expectation that pupils respond in full sentences and use subject-specific vocabulary for certain activities
- also improve your pupils’ skills in listening (e.g. by framing discussion where each person must respond to the previous speaker before making their own point)

$I

<h3>Teaching vocabulary in a special school, in Tom’s own words</h3>
“Some of my pupils are at the earliest stages of learning to talk. It’s important
for them to have basic vocabulary to get their needs met, such as being able to ask
for ‘more’, or ‘help’ or ‘toilet’. At dinner time, when Charlie wants more food,
he may try to reach across the table and take some from another plate. I try to pre-empt
this and say, ‘Oh, Charlie wants more’, showing him the ‘more’ sign (Makaton). I
help him make the sign with his hands and encourage him to say ’more’ before giving
him another spoonful.”

For all children, learning to use words and signs to communicate is an important part of schooling. Certain key words, like those Tom mentioned, are prioritised to help pupils convey their wants and needs to others and reduce the need for them to use other behaviours to get what they want.

It is important in any context that key words that relate to core concepts are reinforced in different situations with different members of staff so that children learn the meaning and power of these words and the importance of mastering them. For many children, using a visual symbol or sign alongside a spoken word will be beneficial in reinforcing meaning and aiding understanding.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on literacy, including the 2 case studies featuring Imogen and Tom.

- Can you give examples from your teaching or where you have observed these aspects of literacy teaching? You can take a note of any you are unsure of to discuss later with your mentor.
- For each of the key concepts, think of them in terms of your own practice. (You might call to mind a particular pupil or a teaching strategy you like to use or one you have seen another teacher use.)

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both sharpen and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which aren’t yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 10 mins

Think about one pupil or one small group of pupils that you teach. Think back over the last half term and consider the different ways in which you have supported their literacy. For example, you may have:

- read aloud high-quality texts
- insisted on them speaking in full sentences as a model for writing
- used worked examples or scaffolds to help improve the quality of their writing
- explicitly taught the specific curriculum vocabulary that you want them to use

Were they efficient approaches in terms of the time and effort spent and their impact?

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

Read through the examples outlined below of potential discussion or observation foci and consider which will be most beneficial for your development. You should bear in mind the ages and stages of development of your pupils as well as your own practice knowledge and skills at this point.

#### 1. Discussion with a colleague:

Identify a colleague to observe or talk to who will enable you to see and evaluate effective practice in this area. For example, this could be a literacy coordinator, an HLTA with special interest in literacy or someone in your own phase or department who has expertise in the area.

#### 2. Observation or discussion:

Choose an aspect of literacy outlined below and an area of focus for discussion and/or observation to carry out with this colleague prior to your mentor meeting. If it saves time for you and your colleague, you could conduct the conversation by email.

| 3m. Demonstrating a clear understanding of systematic synthetic phonics, particularly if teaching early reading and spelling.                                                                                                                             | - What approach to teaching systematic synthetic phonics works best for you in your class? For example, teacher modelling of segmenting and blending orally and in writing. - How is systematic synthetic phonics used to support the teaching of spelling? For example, explicit use of phonics to support the teaching of spelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3o. Teaching unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and planning for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary in what is taught.                                                                                           | - Is vocabulary pre-taught to support understanding for all? For example, teaching vocabulary to specific groups of pupils prior to the lesson to support understanding for all. - How is key technical vocabulary taught and understood in context? For example, use of images to support comprehension (visuals on Interactive White Board or wall displays).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3p. Modelling reading comprehension by asking questions, making predictions and summarising when reading.                                                                                                                                                 | How does the teacher support pupils to summarise a text? For example, modelling identifying key events (so far, we have read that…). How does the teacher model asking questions of the text? For example, using question prompts to respond to the text (What do you like/ dislike about…? Why do you think…? What does this remind you of?)                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3q. Promoting reading for pleasure (e.g. by using a range of whole-class reading approaches and regularly reading high-quality texts to children).                                                                                                        | - How does the teacher engage pupils in reading a wide range of high-quality texts? For example, developing their own knowledge of children’s literature and sharing their own interests with pupils. - How does the school promote reading for pleasure? For example, through the development of reading buddies, book clubs and reading cafes with parents and pupils.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3r. Modelling and requiring high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary). | - How does the teacher encourage pupils to build on one another’s responses? For example, use of ground rules to support the creation of a positive climate for constructive dialogue (I like what X said about this, and I would add… I understand the point that Y made, but I think…). - To what extent do they use sentence stems to scaffold pupils’ oral responses? For example, use of key phrases to support pupils’ responses to talk partner questions (I agree with… because… I understand what you are saying, but have you considered…?). |
| 3s. Teaching different forms of writing by modelling, planning, drafting and editing.                                                                                                                                                                     | - How does the teacher support pupils to plan for writing? For example, use of planning frames to help structure different forms of writing. At what point does the teacher remove these scaffolds? How are pupils supported in editing and improving their writing? - For example, how are the success criteria shared? Is editing time built into the writing process? Do they use peer- or self-assessment during drafting and editing?                                                                                                             |

## Introduction

In the training session from Week 2 and follow-up meeting with your mentor, you looked at the impact of pupils’ prior knowledge on their learning and how knowledge changes through the cooperation of working and long-term memory. These link information related to a current activity to what pupils already know. As part of this, you examined how weak prior knowledge and misconceptions can have a negative effect on subsequent learning. You also looked at how you can take into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce.

Using techniques, such as breaking complex material into smaller steps and reducing distractions, you saw how you can design lessons so that working memory is not overloaded, i.e. avoiding cognitive overload. This means that your pupils can focus their attention on what is relevant in the lesson. You discussed with your mentor how to identify misconceptions and sequence lesson content to provide a more secure base for future learning.

In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of how memory works, focusing on consolidation processes in long-term memory in particular (2.5, 2.7). You will consider how new memories are formed (i.e. learning) and how these new memories integrate with existing knowledge (3.3). You will use an illustrative exercise to understand how learning strategies, such as retrieval practice, spacing and worked examples, can lead to more robust storage of new memories, making for easier retrieval (2.8, 2.9).

You should apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Consolidation, coding, retrieval and spaced practice</h3>
Do you remember that two weeks ago you met Bob, who was learning about cells in his
biology lessons? After initially introducing cells and tackling problems linked to
specialised cells, Bob’s teacher waited a couple of weeks before returning to the
topic and giving Bob’s class a quick quiz on the topic.

<strong>
  Why did Bob’s teacher do this? As you read this Research and Practice Summary,
  try to work out why.

**Consolidation** refers to the process of strengthening or stabilising new memories by transferring new learning from short- to long-term memory storage. When a memory is created (or ‘encoded’), many aspects of that memory (including the context within which the learning occurred) are also stored. Teachers can draw upon this ‘coding’ to help their pupils consolidate new learning as well as to recall learning stored in their long-term memory.

To help your pupils to consolidate their learning, you should:

- give concrete worked examples and elaboration (e.g. explaining the new learning to someone else or showing models of ‘what good looks like’)
- give plenty of opportunity for them to retrieve knowledge that they might have begun to forget (e.g. by spacing your initial teaching and revision and doing recall activities, such as low-stakes questioning)
- establish ‘talk-partners’ within your class so that pupils establish the good habit of explaining things to one another

Encoding is defined as the initial learning of information, storage refers to maintaining information over time and retrieval is the ability to access information when you need it. **Retrieval practice** is any strategy that requires pupils to reconstruct knowledge by ‘calling it to mind’ from their long-term memory, so that it can be recalled, manipulated or used in the present. Retrieval practice is highly effective in helping pupils consolidate material that has been recently learned and is more effective than simply re-reading material. The more easily pupils can retrieve information from their long-term memory, the smaller the load placed on their working memory. This, in turn, allows them to solve problems in front of them more easily or to solve more challenging problems.

To help your pupils to improve their recall, you should:

- require them to retrieve information from memory (this can take the form of frequent, low-stakes testing or quizzing, or you could ask them to demonstrate a previously taught skill so you can see what they have retained)
- try revisiting material from ‘last lesson, last week, last term’: lengthening the spacing increases the challenge and can strengthen recall, that is, spacing the practice

**Spaced practice** is a learning strategy whereby areas of the curriculum are broken up into short sessions, which are repeated over a longer period of time. This can be contrasted with ‘blocking’, whereby learning material is visited in large blocks which are not repeated. Spaced practice provides pupils with the time to form connections between the ideas and concepts so that knowledge can be built upon and easily recalled later. By allowing a memory to be almost forgotten before it is next recalled, Ebbinghaus found the reactivation of the memory is more effortful, which strengthens neural pathways in the brain. When this process is repeated several times, the memory becomes stronger and much easier to remember.

To help with your pupils’ progress using spacing, you should:

- discuss with a colleague how your curriculum is arranged and where the opportunities may be to introduce more spacing
- make sure you enable your pupils to master foundational concepts first
- combine with retrieval practice activities, such as low-stakes testing, to improve their recall

<h3>What did Bob’s teacher do?</h3>
Sarah, who teaches Bob biology, carefully considered how she would teach Bob’s class
about the structure and function of cells. This is foundational knowledge that Bob
and his peers need to have a secure understanding of to succeed in biology.

Sarah began with careful exposition and opportunities for pupils to initially learn about cells. During their next lesson, they took this further to consolidate their learning by tackling a series of questions. After this second lesson, Sarah checked to ensure that all pupils understood what she had taught them and was pleased that they had.

However, Sarah knew that this would not be enough to consolidate this key knowledge into their long-term memory. Therefore, she planned opportunities to revisit this content using retrieval practice after appropriate intervals (spacing). Sarah did this using some quick questions at the start of her lessons linked to what pupils had learnt in the previous week. By adopting this approach, Sarah will support her pupils to learn about this foundational topic.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Think back to the cell biology scenario you considered in your first self-directed learning session of this module, where Bob had to learn about cell structures. Use that scenario as a model (see the Research and Practice Summary). For the subject, phase or setting you teach in, you will develop a similar exercise that you could use with one pupil or group of pupils to test the practices of retrieval and spaced practice.

#### 2. Independent planning

Consider your lesson plans for the forthcoming week and identify one context where you can try to use these learning strategies to aid consolidation of new information, as illustrated by the scenario with Bob.

- identify the lesson or part of a lesson which you will focus on
- write a simple plan for how you will make use of your learning about retrieval practice and spaced practice in this lesson or part of a lesson – and think about whether starting with a worked example might be helpful
- annotate your plan to show why you have designed it in this way and discuss your thoughts with your mentor when you show them your plan

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your planning from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor, including raising any questions that have come to mind while completing this task.

## Introduction

Over the last four weeks, you have been considering how pupils learn through building on their prior knowledge and the roles of working memory, long-term memory (2.5) and consolidation (2.7) within this. You have also looked at how retrieval and spacing practice (2.8) allow the mastering of foundational concepts (3.3) and the potential of worked examples (2.9) in developing this.

In this self-study session, you will begin to apply your understanding of how we learn and move on to considering what pupils learn and why.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>
  Critical thinking, transfer and schemata in a values-led Year 6 PE lesson
</h3>
Rachel passionately believes that PE is a great way to inculcate important life-skills
and values in her pupils. She must also keep to the National Curriculum.

<strong>
  As you read this summary, think about how Rachel can use an invasion game
  lesson to teach her pupils important values that they can think critically
  about and apply elsewhere.
</strong>
$CTA

A school’s **curriculum** sets out its vision for the knowledge, values and skills that it wishes its pupils to learn. Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, there has been a National Curriculum in England and Wales which specifies the core of what should be covered within the state education sector. At GCSE and A level, the National Curriculum also forms the basis for the specifications written by examination boards. Contemporary curriculum guidance makes clear that schools are expected to go beyond the core curriculum. In particular, schools have a responsibility to identify the specific knowledge, skills and values that will benefit their pupils. At all stages of education, therefore, teachers and school leaders determine the details of what is taught and how this content is sequenced. In order to teach a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, teachers need a sound knowledge of the essential concepts, skills and principles of the subject. It is therefore essential that teachers develop and maintain a high level of subject knowledge through initial and continuing professional development.

**Subject knowledge** encompasses what a teacher knows about the nature of a subject, the appropriate pedagogies to teach that subject and an expert awareness of how that subject appears in the curriculum (i.e. what needs to be taught.) A teacher will continue therefore to expand their subject knowledge throughout their career. It is essential to effective teaching, for motivating and inspiring pupils, and for helping them to succeed academically.

You should aim to improve your subject knowledge by:

- engaging in high-quality, subject-specific professional development (e.g. by doing development work, such as planning and moderation with colleagues in school and in wider networks)
- participating in wider networks of fellow professionals, such as the Chartered College of Teaching
- building a repertoire of resources, illustrations and explanations by working with experienced colleagues-- these colleagues may be in your school or members of networks (including online networks) which generate, share and critique such resources

One of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ **prior knowledge** within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load.

To help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils, you should:

- take account of it when planning how much new information to introduce (e.g. by conducting quick tests that give you instant feedback)
- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (e.g. by pre-teaching concepts or by using classroom display to reinforce foundational ideas that are prone to misconception)
- give them regular purposeful practice (by setting aside time in each lesson) so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory

### How should Rachel take account of her pupils’ prior knowledge?

A mental model or **schema** (plural **schemata**) is a pattern or network of thoughts, beliefs, knowledge and understanding that organise categories of information and the relationships between them. Schema can be simple (e.g. cars are a kind of vehicle) or complex (e.g. to drive a car, you need to start the ignition, apply the clutch, put it in gear, check the mirrors, and so on).

By encouraging pupils to think about how concepts relate to one another, teachers can help them build increasingly complex and robust schemata. Metaphorically, schemata can be thought of as systems of hooks or shelves onto which pupils can hang, place or incorporate new knowledge, skills, and beliefs.

To help your pupils develop their schemata and build increasingly complex mental models, you can:

- revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples
- draw explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject (e.g. by asking pupils to arrange ideas into categories - ‘Put together all the words that are about weather’ ‘Arrange the images by the places you would expect to find them’)
- carefully sequence teaching to facilitate the process of organising knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (e.g. in primary maths, you might organise a sequence of lessons where you introduce progressively less familiar quadrilaterals, always pointing out their common features)
- when you want to get your pupils to think about how they learn (metacognition), adopt a simple approach and repeat it often (e.g. use an acronym to help your pupils recall the steps)

**Critical thinking** describes the ability to obtain and analyse information about a given topic in an organised and rational manner in order to understand the connections between concepts, facts and ideas and to arrive at judgments or conclusions.

In order for critical thinking to take place, pupils must first have a secure knowledge of the concepts they are being asked to think about. It is difficult to think critically about a topic you know little about. However, there are also general aspects to critical thinking – aspects that are highly transferrable across subjects. These include constructing and deconstructing arguments, questioning, applying logic and reasoning, identifying and recognising logical fallacies, analysis, interpretation, inference, explanation, self-regulation, open-mindedness and problem-solving.

To help your pupils think critically, you should:

- ensure they have a secure understanding of the subject area knowledge you want them to think critically about
- invite them to think critically by sharing their reasoning and challenging the reasoning of others (e.g. by asking ‘What is your main reason for agreeing with Bilal?’, ‘Why might Leon have arrived at a different judgement?’)

### Why might Rachel want her pupils to do some critical thinking in her lesson?

The question of **transfer** is also an important one in education: to what extent are knowledge and skills transferable from one subject to another? To what extent can pupils transfer their learning in one context (e.g., drawing graphs in maths) to another (e.g. drawing graphs in science)? To what extent are pupils able to apply the knowledge and skills they learn in school to their lives beyond the school gates? Research suggests that to a significant degree, knowledge and skills are context-dependent, that is, they tend to remain rooted in the contexts in which they were learned. This does not mean that transfer is not possible, but it does not tend to occur automatically, or naturally. It is therefore important that teachers support pupils in transferring knowledge and skills from one domain to another and provide them with opportunities to practise transfer themselves.

To help you to support pupils to transfer their knowledge, you should:

- frequently ask the question ‘Where else do you use these ideas?’ (e.g. while teaching graphs in maths, you might ask them how they would apply the same knowledge to geography or science)
- model the connections yourself (e.g. by saying how you use the knowledge or ideas in your own life)
- draw comparisons between the subjects your pupils learn, whether you teach them across subjects or the teaching is shared by colleagues (e.g. a history teacher could refer to the war poetry their class had studied in English)

<h3>
  Transfer: Helen, a teacher in a Pupil Referral Unit, explains her thinking
</h3>
“Many of the PRU pupils initially struggle to see the point in learning.  In order
to get them to see their PRU experience as a whole, we look for cross-curricular
links, and I aim to include transferrable skills where possible in my lessons.  So,
when I am teaching about climates, I will get pupils to draw climate graphs.  Before
doing this, we will look at different types of graphs, and I will ask pupils what
they are and how they could be used. I will also ask them when they last drew one
in order to get them to see that they are transferring skills from other subjects
and that skills learned in lessons should not be seen as stand-alone.  I know this
works when pupils moan that they have already done this in maths or science or they
complete the graph element independently with little help.”

<strong>How might this apply equally to Rachel?</strong>

<h3>What did Rachel do?</h3>
Here is a recreation of Rachel’s lesson plan, with a commentary about why it worked
well.

<strong>Aim</strong>: To teach the 3Cs (co-operation, communication,
collaboration) through an uneven-sided invasion game.

<strong>Initial instruction</strong>: ‘Cooperation, communication and
collaboration are really important in life and in sport. Working in a team, make
a plan to help you achieve success in a game of ‘Pass/Head/Kick’. In your team,
discuss and make a list of what helps you to achieve success in a team game.’

<strong>Explanation of rules</strong>: Teams are 4 attackers ‘v’ 2 defenders.
Attack: Teams of 4 have to move the ball from one end of the court to the other.
They can either throw, head or kick the ball in any combination, but they must
throw, kick and head at least once before scoring. They cannot use two of the
same technique one after the other. Defence: Teams of 2 have to try to intercept
the ball to prevent the attackers from getting the ball to the opposite end of
the court.

<strong>Warm-up</strong>: Practise throwing, catching and heading the ball
between pairs.

<strong>Play the game</strong>: Rachel monitors the play and keeps a record of
how her pupils show the 3Cs.

<strong>Plenary</strong>: Rachel stops the lesson for the ‘EAR’ part of the
lesson. Rachel often uses EAR so the pupils have a framework for their thinking.

        your team have done better? What do you think are the important
        ingredients to making a team a success? What have you learned about the
        3Cs that would help you be more successful in other lessons or
        situations?
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
This lesson is consistent with core knowledge requirements of the National
Curriculum, where pupils are required to communicate, collaborate and compete
with each other and evaluate and recognise their own success. They develop
physical competence in throwing, catching, kicking, controlling and heading the
ball. Rachel believes in the 3Cs’ attribute and in the values of fairness and
respect, which are built into team games like this. The warm-up enabled Rachel
to check the prior learning of her pupils in these physical skills. She could
give feedback on their 3Cs as she monitored them at play. This lesson enabled
pupils to develop a range of core knowledge and skills relating to their
physical, cognitive, social and affective development. These are all skills that
are important and have application across the wider curriculum and life beyond
school. Her questioning in EAR drew attention to that transfer. As the EAR phase
unfolded, it also allowed the pupils to think critically about successful team
strategies. By using EAR, Rachel helps her pupils to develop increasingly
complex schemata for adding new ideas to existing knowledge. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic, including the examples from Helen and Rachel. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Reflect

Think about your own values: Why did you want to be a teacher? What difference to society are you hoping to make by being a teacher? Now think how these values might influence the way you transform the national and school curricula in your classroom. Remember how Rachel taught the 3Cs values in her PE lesson.

- write one sentence outlining your values for education: what is education for?
- add below your sentence 3 examples of how you enact your values in your classroom
- below that add 3 more examples of wider activities in your school which you would say are consistent with your own values

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

As mentioned in the Early Career Framework, secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively (3.2). There is therefore a need for teachers to maintain and extend their subject and curriculum knowledge throughout their careers. Over this week and next, we suggest practical activities which aim at framing this knowledge and relating it to what you have already seen around misconceptions and progression.

#### **1.** Independent planning

Now, bring together your appreciation of the values inherent in education with the way that you might organize learning. Do this through planning your approach to a topic that you will be teaching soon, ideally a topic that you are less comfortable with, so that you can develop your own understanding further. You can focus on a sequence of lessons, an individual lesson or even one part of a lesson, as best suits your context. Consider the following questions as you do so:

1. What core knowledge and skills should be conveyed within this topic?
2. What opportunities are there to support your educational values in this topic?
3. Draw on your understanding of your pupils’ prior knowledge to sequence the content within the lesson(s) (and any home learning).
4. You do not need to go as far as developing your planning in detail, but at this point, you may have ideas for engaging activities which will support pupil learning, so jot these down.

#### **2**. Independent planning

With this outline of a teaching sequence in place, now add to your sequence at least one opportunity for pupils to use their learning to think critically. This could be a discussion about a real-world problem, in which they outline their reasoning, or it could be a creative process involving their knowledge. As an extension activity for your pupils, you could ask them to identify how that might apply – transfer – their learning from this to other contexts.

To support your planning, Rachel’s lesson plan might give you a model to follow.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Be ready to share your planning notes and your other learning from this session with your mentor in your next meeting with them. You may find it helpful to make a few notes on your planning explaining why you have included particular aspects and the reasoning behind how they are sequenced.

In activity 1(c), you may have identified some subject content that you are not yet fully confident in teaching. Make a note of the topics you identified and set yourself a target date by which you will complete some further study in relation to these topics.

## Introduction

In the mentor session in week 1, you conducted an audit against standards 4 & 5 in the Early Career Framework. You should keep your findings in mind as you follow this self-study session.

In this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of effective modelling that enables pupils to access difficult concepts, alongside how you model worked examples to scaffold learning in a way that allows a gradual release of responsibility to your pupils. This session will also consider the importance of repeated practice to ensure that you maximise opportunities for pupils to succeed, through the appropriate level of guidance and support.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>
  Modelling and Scaffolding for structured writing in a Pupil Referral Unit
</h3>
Helen wants her small group of Key Stage 3 pupils to write some paragraphs on ‘What
does it mean to be British?’ She knows that her pupils have a range of learning needs,
they are largely disinclined to work independently and they are prone to give up
before a task is finished.

<strong>
  How might Helen scaffold her pupils’ learning, while also building their
  independence, so that they are able to write their paragraphs on British
  Values?
</strong>
$CTA

**Modelling** is an instructional strategy in which the teacher demonstrates a new concept or approach to learning, and pupils learn by observing. It describes the process of learning or acquiring new information, skills, or behaviour through observation, rather than through direct experience or trial-and-error efforts. Modelling involves using a new method or concept as part of the instruction process, so that pupils can hear or see what you intend them to do. It helps them to understand more clearly how to solve a problem or construct a sentence, for example, by seeing it being done. It also enables them to practise more effectively, and therefore encode and consolidate the new learning in the long-term memory. Examples of modelling include written, visual or video guides, scaffolding, and worked examples.

$CTA

<strong>
  For Helen, what would be useful for her to model for her pupils, and when
  should she do it?
</strong>
$CTA

**Worked examples** involve pupils studying the solved ‘problem’, rather than solving the problem themselves. They are highly effective because they reduce cognitive load, allowing pupils to focus on one step of a problem at a time without ‘getting lost’ in the problem. The aim is for the pupils to gain as close an understanding as possible of what their teacher sees as a high-quality model.

To help you use worked examples to aid your pupils’ progress, you should:

- provide your pupils with a question or problem, alongside a detailed explanation of the solution (e.g. showing them one you made earlier, or what a good one looks like)
- guide them through the process of following the worked example (e.g. highlighting the criteria that made it successful, and how you achieved them)
- this provides the pupils with a guide for how to solve other, similar problems ensure that the range of tasks available to pupils with lower and higher prior attainment are appropriately pitched, to ensure that all pupils are able to push themselves to meet their ‘challenge target’ in each lesson

$CTA

<strong>
  Would you recommend that Helen use a worked example for her class, Why? Why
  not?
</strong>
$CTA

**Scaffolding** refers to a variety of instructional techniques used to move pupils progressively toward stronger understanding and, ultimately, toward greater independence in their learning. It describes a system of prompts or supports that pupils can use at the beginning of a learning cycle, which are gradually withdrawn as they become more confident.

To help your pupils make better progress through scaffolding, you should:

- avoid overwhelming their working memory (e.g. by breaking new content down and reframing questions)
- gradually reduce the amount of scaffolding that is given, as they become more confident\*
- give opportunities to repeat (rehearse), as this will build confidence and independence (You can allow them to practise with and without the scaffolds.)

\[\*A model of how to withdraw prompts and support gradually is shown here:]

It is useful to recognise that, although many language skills are generic, they may also be specific to individual subjects. This becomes increasingly important as pupils get older and experience a wider set of **subject-specific literacy** demands, the academic language and conventions of different subjects. For example, pupils in one subject (say, science) may read a text purely for information, whereas in history or English they might need to be aware of the author’s interpretation.

To help your pupils understand the discipline-specific aspects of literacy in your subject, you should:

- ask yourself what is unique about your discipline, in terms of reading, writing, speaking or listening – for example, does ‘writing a report’ mean the same thing to you as it does to a teacher of another discipline?
- with colleagues, compile lists of words or phrases which are used atypically in your discipline, or which are foundational to your discipline (good quality textbooks are good places to look)

Extensive **practice** is also important, and gradually reducing the amount of support and scaffolding that is given will enable pupils to become more confident and independent. It can also allow pupils to master and build up individual aspects of learning without having to do everything at once.

$I

<h3>What did Helen do? In her own words:</h3>
"I use scaffolding techniques a lot, especially if I want a considered piece of writing
completed. With one group, I was looking at British Values: ‘What does it mean to
be British?’ My aim was to achieve a few paragraphs on this. My group was not particularly
keen on writing. I needed them to build up their ideas slowly before elaborating,
otherwise it was quite possible I would get a refusal by some to do the work. We
started off with a ‘hook’, a muddled cartoon picture showing lots of ‘British’ things.
Pupils had to find and name as many as they could – my pupils love a bit of challenge
and competition, so this type of activity often goes down well. Once completed, the
pupils were given blank cards to identify any possible groupings and write them down
(e.g. food), then adding actual examples. All the time this was going on, my aim
was to question the pupils about their understanding of the topics we were looking
at. Once the pupils had the information they had obtained, I revealed to them that
I am Irish. I showed them (in different colours) one sentence I had already written
about ‘What it means to be Irish’, one sentence about how I could personally relate
to this topic, and one sentence about what it showed about Ireland. All my pupils
were ready then to write their own sentences. I could see them looking at the board
at my sentences, trying to work out what they would need to change. Some pupils stopped
there, but one pupil who had been vocal in discussion added her own introduction
and (with my prompting) a conclusion paragraph. This activity reflected a growing
understanding of the topic, plus a move towards more independent learning by one
pupil."

Helen was aware that, before her pupils could write, they would need help with generating ideas to write about. This is where she used the muddled cartoon and the blank cards, which helped her pupils to gather ideas into categories – which would then become paragraphs. This was her main scaffolding technique: it suggested the structure that her pupils should follow, but allowed them freedom to select independently. She then modelled with a worked example, one which was different – but sufficiently similar – to the final product she wanted from the class. One of her pupils was able to move to the next stage without any explicit modelling.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Self-assessment

Think back to the last two weeks of your teaching – if it helps, think about one curriculum area, or one class – and focus on where you have used explicit modelling and scaffolding. Doing the following quick self-assessment will help establish your priorities for the independent planning exercise which comes after.

| Activity             | **😊😑😕** | Examples and notes |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Exposition           |            |                    |
| Shared practice      |            |                    |
| Guided practice      |            |                    |
| Independent practice |            |                    |

(\*Refer back to the Research and Practice Summary above)

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Independent Planning

Now look ahead to an area of your curriculum which you will be covering soon, where you know it would be helpful for pupils to have a degree of scaffolding and modelling.

If, in your self-assessment above, you said you were unhappy with ‘exposition’, you might choose to focus now on modelling. Worked examples are very useful when sharing practice. As your pupils move from guided to independent practice, you might introduce and then withdraw scaffolds.

To support you with independent planning:

- look again at the example from Helen in the Pupil Referral Unit
- remember to build in opportunities for your pupils to practise independently (Do you need them to work in pairs, larger groups or alone? How much time will you allow in your lesson?)
- how will you judge when your pupils are ready to have any scaffolds removed? (e.g. Will you assess their readiness by selected questioning or circulating the room? Sometimes it is a good idea to allow pupils to choose to work with or without a scaffold.)

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your planning notes from this session to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor and work with them to review and refine your planning.

## Introduction

In the last mentor session, you further explored how effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning, focusing in more detail on its practical implications. The key messages from that session were to understand why modelling helps pupils to understand ideas and why scaffolds and worked examples (and their gradual removal) are central to building pupils’ confidence and expertise.

In this self-directed study session, you will extend your knowledge of how to introduce new material in steps, making links to pupils’ prior knowledge, with an emphasis on **expositions** (explanations). This session will also focus on an essential teaching tool, **questioning**, and how it can be used for many purposes in order to secure knowledge and understanding.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Exposition and questioning – ‘How books work’ in Early Years</h3>
As an Early Years teacher, Jo needs to teach her pupils how written language works.
This includes how books work. There is a lot of knowledge pupils need to acquire
in this first step towards reading. For example, they need to know that: books are
held in a particular way; print has meaning and can be used for different purposes;
there is a relationship between print and speech and there is a difference between
letters and words.

Jo knows she cannot teach all of the concepts at once to her young pupils. <strong>What would you recommend she do?</strong>
$CTA

You have seen that the gradual release of responsibility model can bring together key ideas about teaching and learning. This research and practice summary explores two parts of this model: exposition, whereby teachers introduce new ideas; and checking understanding through questioning, which can help teachers decide how to move between different stages in the model.

**Exposition** refers to the process of explaining concepts, ideas and information with great clarity. It requires the teacher to have sound knowledge of the curriculum area, and involves ensuring that pupils are able to understand new information in the context of their prior knowledge and understanding. Exposition is about more than simply telling pupils information. It also involves providing examples to illustrate and illuminate the material to be learned. Examples can include visual and conceptual models, application of rules, and contextual information. Good exposition may also involve modelling. Exposition does not require pupils to make discoveries themselves: by moving from the general to the specific, it allows pupils to understand increasingly detailed explanations of the material to be learned, and link those explanations to information presented previously as part of a general overview.

To help your pupils learn through more effective exposition you should:

- be prepared to break down your expositions further for those pupils who may need it (e.g. by ‘chunking’ bits of knowledge across several lessons)
- plan what you are going to say and how you are going to model to your pupils (e.g. by scripting it in your lesson plan)
- think about the visuals and examples you can use that will help your pupils connect this new learning with that they already know (e.g. by referring to characters they have met in favourite stories)
- allow time also for pupils to practise: don’t simply rely upon exposition

$CTA
Jo already knows that she needs to break down the concepts related to how books work. <strong>How else might she benefit from the research on exposition?</strong>
$CTA

When introducing abstract ideas, it is important often to use **concrete representations**. These might take the form of analogies, metaphors, examples and non-examples. Teachers often over-estimate their pupils’ grasp of the abstract, and then overlook the misconceptions that can arise. Numbers are abstract, as can be such concepts as the ‘Church’ (i.e. the institution), verbs, the past or ‘science’.

To help you with your expositions of abstract ideas, you should:

- use manipulables (e.g. blocks and shapes)
- construct number lines and timelines
- use play and drama to ‘act out’ words and concepts
- when using graphic representation, make sure you are not introducing a new misconception (e.g. an image of a church building may not help pupils appreciate the idea of Church as an institution.)

Repeat these approaches often: they are a form of scaffold, which can be gradually removed when you assess that your pupils are ready.

$CTA

<strong>
  What ‘concrete’ ways might Jo choose to represent the concepts of how books
  and written language work?
</strong>
$CTA

To ensure that learning is effective and efficient it is critical to regularly check pupils’ understanding and use this information to adapt teaching. This can be done in many different ways, but questioning is a key tool. **Questioning** is the key method by which teachers find out what pupils already know, identify gaps in knowledge and understanding and scaffold the development of their understanding to enable them to close the gap between what they currently know and the learning goals. Questions serve a number of essential purposes for teachers. For example, they:

- provide the teacher with immediate feedback on pupils’ understanding, which can then be used to modify the teaching
- prompt pupils to inspect their existing knowledge – articulating and retrieving helps clarify and consolidate learning, and improves the likelihood that it will be retained
- focus pupils on the key components of the learning sequence
- enable teachers and pupils to see progress over time
- model for pupils how experienced learners seek meaning, moving them towards greater independence

To help you use questioning to check your pupils’ prior learning and to assess their understanding, you could:

- use multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions during lessons (e.g. a good source of well-constructed multiple-choice questions can be past examination papers, if these are available in your phase and specialism)
- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding (e.g. ‘tell me how you reached that answer’, ‘what tells you that this is the correct answer?’)
- use ‘hands-down’ questioning – when you pose a question to the whole class, give them thinking time, then you select the pupils to speak
- combine ‘hands-down’ with ‘think-pair-share', where everyone thinks alone, then discusses with a partner, before the teacher selects the pupils to answer
- allow thinking time – often a little longer than feels naturally comfortable

Recording key questions in schemes of work also encourages teachers to identify what they want pupils to know and understand, to communicate this to pupils (sharing learning goals) and to find ways of checking that these have been achieved in lessons. This in turn enables teachers to tailor their teaching to what pupils need to know next.

$I
Jo will certainly be asking lots of questions, to check her pupils’ understanding and to help her break down the problems for them.
$I

<h3>What did Jo do?</h3>
Jo decided to ‘chunk’ the knowledge and understanding of how written language in
books works. She also chose to give the pupils repeated exposure to the steps, so
that the knowledge would stick. To start, she selected just one focus: how to hold
a book. She then went through these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Check what the pupils already know about holding a book. She observed her
    pupils with books, holding them, leafing through them, pretending to read
    them. She noted those pupils who frequently handled the books incorrectly
    and carried out the next steps with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‘I do it’. Modelling: picking up the book and talking through how the book
    should be held. She thought ‘out loud’: I’m thinking about which way up this
    book goes. I need to hold it like this so that I can open the pages like
    this. The pages I open are always on this side.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‘We do it together’. Checking their understanding by simple true/false
    questioning: holding the book up the wrong way, do they notice? Am I holding
    the book the right way? To stop them merely guessing, she did ‘think, pair,
    share’ with them so all had to think about their answers.
  </li>
  <li>
    ‘You do it with/without my support’. The pupils now think they know how to
    hold a book, but can they remember how the next time she asks them? She
    checked how they could apply their knowledge from before, using the same
    book. Do you remember the book we looked at yesterday? Can you pick the book
    up and show me how to hold it so we can look at it together?
  </li>
  <li>
    ‘You do it with/without my support’ in a new context. She checked their
    application with different types of books: Can you hold the Big Book so we
    can read it together? Let’s look at this pop-up book together. It’s a bit
    different from other books we’ve seen, can you see how to hold it?
  </li>
</ol>
This approach worked well for Jo. It could work equally well in a range of other
settings, for almost any new set of material. The most important elements were to
assess her pupils’ prior knowledge (by observing them handling books informally)
and to break the new learning into small steps (both in recognising the different
elements to ‘How books work’, and in chunking down one element into yet smaller steps.)
The only concrete representation she needed was the book itself, but it is good practice
always to ‘make real’ what your pupils might find abstract. All the while, at each
stage she checked understanding with simple questioning. Finally, she gradually released
responsibility to her pupils, moving through stages of ‘I do it’ to ‘You do it’.
This was how they practised and applied their new knowledge, and gained accuracy
and confidence. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

**Reflection**. Use these prompts to help you to reflect on your classroom practice over the past few weeks.

- When you introduced new material, did you do it in small steps? How did that go?
- How did you explain abstract ideas? Did you use concrete examples? How did that go?
- Did you use different questioning approaches to gauge your pupils’ understanding? How did that go?
- What would you keep doing, or do more of? What might you do less of, or stop doing?

You could record your most important reflections in your Learning Log.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

You have a choice of activities now. The reflection exercise you just did will help you choose, as will your self-audit from the start of this module.

**_Either:_**

#### 1. Independent planning

Use your learning from this session to plan a lesson that you will shortly be teaching. You may choose to focus on a specific part of the lesson, if this best suits your context. Annotate your plan to show how you have drawn on your learning from this self-study session. It is best if you produce a lesson plan where you will be introducing new material to the pupils. Consider as much of the following as you can in your planning:

- how you plan to break down the new knowledge and concepts into small steps so that you do not overload pupils’ working memory
- how to script your expositions to include examples, analogies or metaphors
- how you could include both a verbal explanation and graphical or concrete representation of the same concept
- how you will explicitly link the new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned
- how you will plan your questions for specific points of the lesson to (a) check pupils’ prior knowledge, (b) assess their understanding, and (c) assist them to break down problems
- the types of questions used to extend and challenge pupils (modelling and developing pupils’ vocabulary)
- the wait time between question and response in order to elicit more developed responses

**_Or:_**

#### 2. Observe a colleague

Ask permission to observe part of a colleague’s lesson, where they will be introducing new material to the pupils. Be sure to tell them what the focus of your observation is, so that you can be there at the right time. You should aim to observe a colleague who is known to be good at introducing new material. But remember, you are not there to judge them.

It is a good idea to use a focused observation grid, like this:

|                     |                    |                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Start of the lesson | Body of the lesson | End of the lesson |
| Whole class         | Small groups       | Individual pupils |

During different parts of the lesson, and to different groupings of pupils, how does the teacher do any of the following:

- How does the teacher breakdown content into small steps?
- Are steps taken to reduce load on working memory? If so, what steps did they take?
- How do they explicitly link the new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned?
- Does the teacher include both a verbal explanation and graphical representation to explain the same concept?
- Do their expositions include examples, analogies or metaphors?
- How is questioning used to assess pupil understanding throughout?
- Does the teacher use different types of questions to extend and challenge pupils? How do they model and develop pupils’ vocabulary?
- Is there appropriate wait time between question and response to elicit the more developed responses required?

N.B. Don’t expect to see all of this in one lesson.

After the observation, annotate your notes to show how they reflect your reading around expositions and questioning.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Be ready to share this, and your other learning from this session, with your mentor in your next meeting with them.

## Introduction

In the previous mentor session (week 3), your mentor guided you to extend your knowledge of how to introduce new material in steps, making links to pupils’ prior knowledge, with an emphasis on expositions (explanations), for example the use of concrete representations for abstract ideas. In that session, you explored practical examples of using questioning for different purposes, in order for pupils to secure knowledge and understanding (for example, with ‘stem questions’ as a supportive tool). Finally, you were given guidance in order to consider expositions and questioning when introducing new material to pupils.

In this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of how to transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning through modelling the effective use of metacognitive strategies to enable pupils to self-regulate their learning. You will also reflect on the role that setting homework plays in the transformation of pupils’ capabilities and knowledge about learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.

<h3>Modelling metacognitive strategies – Year 1 Science</h3>
Christine is teaching science to her Year 1 class. She wants them to be able to name
a variety of common animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals,
and to identify the main differences between fish and amphibians. Earlier in the
lesson she reminded them of work from Reception year on the differences between plants
and animals; and she introduced the core vocabulary (fish, bird, amphibian, mammal,
reptile) alongside example images of each type of animal.

<strong>
  How could she use metacognition and self-regulation strategies here to help
  her pupils?
</strong>
$CTA

You have previously seen how the gradual release of responsibility model can bring together some key ideas about teaching and learning. The stages in the model could be described in various ways. However, the central idea is that effective teaching begins with exposition and modelling, and provides extensive practice with fading of support with the end goal of achieving independence. Throughout the process, teachers check pupils’ understanding to identify the best next steps in learning and dynamically move pupils between the stages.

**Metacognition** is often described simply as ‘thinking about thinking’. We learn to control our thinking by monitoring what we know about people (self and others), tasks and strategies. Metacognitive knowledge grows through experience, by setting goals and by selecting strategies to achieve those goals. All of these components interact with one another, and through such interactions we develop metacognitive skills and further our metacognitive knowledge. In practical terms, a useful rule of thumb is to think of metacognition as focusing on the ‘how’ of learning.

To help you to teach your pupils metacognitive strategies, you could:

- ‘think aloud’: show your pupils what you are thinking when you are carrying out a complex task (e.g. ‘When I come to write this conclusion, I need to remember to...’)
- build opportunities in your lessons for your pupils to plan out their time, and for them to monitor (perhaps with a partner) their progress through a task
- get your pupils to evaluate their learning (e.g. pupils award themselves _WWW_ and _EBI_ )
- when instructing them in a new task, remind your pupils how they will be thinking and learning in a similar way to one they have experienced before

$CTA

<strong>
  Given the age of Christine’s pupils, and what she wants them to learn, which
  of these strategies might work best for her? Which might work best for your
  own context?
</strong>
$CTA

**Self-regulated learning**, an associated concept, is about how pupils monitor their learning. Self-regulated learners are aware of their strengths and limitations, they set learning goals for themselves, they monitor their behaviour in terms of their goals and self-reflect on their increasing effectiveness. This enhances their self-satisfaction and motivation to continue to improve.

To help you to teach your pupils to self-regulate in their learning, you could:

- set yourself, or others, as an example (e.g. ‘I self-regulate my learning by making a promise to myself to read about my subject for two hours every Sunday, and giving myself a treat when I do.’)
- make self-evaluation and target-setting a frequent feature of learning (e.g. by asking your pupils to use ‘I can’ and ‘I will’ statements after they have finished a topic.)
- in verbal feedback, invite your pupils to express themselves in terms of their strengths, their development areas and their next steps
- closely monitor not just the quality of their homework, but how they do it (e.g. the total time they spend on it, the breaks they build in for themselves, how they chunk it, if they draft and re-draft. You could sample this with just a small number of your pupils.)

$CTA

<strong>Will any of these strategies be useful for Christine?</strong>
$CTA

**Modelling** is an instructional strategy in which the teacher demonstrates a new concept or approach to learning and pupils learn by observing. It describes the process of learning or acquiring new information, skills, or behaviour through observation, rather than through direct experience or trial-and-error efforts. Modelling involves using a new method or concept as part of the instruction process, so that pupils can hear or see what you intend them to do. It helps them to understand more clearly how to solve a problem or construct a sentence, for example, by seeing it being done. It also enables them to practise more effectively, and therefore encode and consolidate the new learning in the long-term memory. Examples of modelling include written, visual or video guides, scaffolding, and worked examples.

<h3>What Christine did – a script of her lesson</h3>
‘I want to see if I can remember the names of the different animal groups. I have
a cool way of remembering them. It’s linked to a pet shop I go to called FARM B.
(show image of pet shop sign “FARM B”). Inside, all of the different animals are
grouped together. In the F section are the fish. In the A section are the amphibians.
In the R section, hmm let me think which of our animal groups begins with ‘r’? (Refer
back to images of different animals with names.) Oh yes, the reptiles. Then onto
the M section. That’s the mammals. Then finally we have the B section. What were
they again? Birds. Let me check if I have them all, F - Fish, A - amphibians, R -
reptiles, M - mammals, B - birds. FARM B - what an easy way to remember the different
types of animals!’

She then explored features of fish and amphibians through looking at both groups, sharing what the pupils know about each. She asked questions e.g. How do I breathe? How do I move? Where do I live?

‘How can I tell a fish from an amphibian?

Now I know the names “fish” and “amphibian”, I need to remember how to tell them apart. I know that the main difference is that amphibians can breathe in and out of water. How can I remember that difference? Let’s look at the word: <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Amphib</strong> <strong>I</strong>n <strong>an</strong>d out</span>

That’s a great way of remembering that amphibians can breathe in and out of water! I love it when the names of animals tell us about their special features!’

Christine then showed the class a picture of an unnamed animal, with ‘clues’.

‘So, let me see if this works for animal x. The clue says “I can breathe out of water.” Hmm, so can amphibians, so does this mean it is definitely an amphibian? No, because there are other groups of animals that can breathe out of water, like birds and mammals, so I must look at its other features.

Clue 2: “I can also breathe in water.” Right, I’m happy to say it must be an amphibian now because only amphibians can breathe in and out of water.’

Christine narrated her thought processes by thinking out loud. This would model metacognition linked to subject knowledge for her pupils. Her use of mnemonics (FARM B, Amphib In and out) helped make the learning memorable. She alerted her pupils to the potential pitfall (of classing all animals that breathe out of water amphibians). To check their learning had ‘stuck’ she set the class homework to use the mnemonic to help them work out the features of another group of animals. She then used this homework task to revisit the learning and build upon their knowledge.

Be ready to share this checklist with your mentor and to talk about one or two examples of how you have supported metacognition and self-regulated learning.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

Use your self-audit from the start of this module and the checklist you just completed when deciding on which of the following options to select.

#### 1. Scripting

Identify parts of a forthcoming lesson where explicit modelling is required. Develop a script for sharing your implicit thought processes in a way that makes your thoughts clear and explicit to the pupils. Have you made any common assumptions around concepts that may need to be explicitly highlighted to pupils?

Have a look again at Christine’s Year 1 science lesson for an example of a script.

#### 2. Practical activity

Look ahead to the next piece of homework that you will set for your class. When designing the homework, create a written model or worked example which demonstrates the implicit thought processes needed to successfully attempt the task. Pupils can use this model to scaffold their own thought processes.

To support this practical activity, you could look back at Week 2, when you considered worked examples.

#### 3. Analyse artefacts

Review a series of homework tasks you have previously set. It would be useful to bring a small set of homework with you to your mentor meeting, where you have annotated in the margin:

What range of learning tasks did you adopt?

What did you learn about your pupils when they completed the homeworks?

Was your (and their) focus more on the quality or the quantity?

Was there evidence of pupils regulating their own learning?

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Be ready to share this, and your other learning from this session, with your mentor in your next meeting with them.

## **Introduction**

You have been looking at the importance of explicitly teaching metacognitive strategies and how you can support pupils by narrating thought processes aloud when modelling, making the steps in a process memorable and exposing potential pitfalls.

This work built on your earlier learning, where you explored the importance of good modelling in helping pupils to understand new processes and ideas and the importance of guides, scaffolds and worked examples in developing pupil expertise.

In this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of the importance of high-quality classroom talk (which you last looked at in Module 2) in order to help pupils to articulate key ideas, extend their vocabulary and consolidate their understanding of key knowledge and processes. You will also consider how thoughtful grouping of pupils can be a powerful tool for supporting more effective learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils, and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Collaborative classroom talk – Year 11 geography</h3>
In Sarah’s Year 11 geography lesson, she wanted her pupils to think hard about different
economic and social measures of development (gross national income (GNI) per head,
birth and death rates, infant mortality, life expectancy, people per doctor, literacy
rates, access to safe water, Human Development Index (HDI)) and the limitations of
using these economic and social measures.

The class contains 25 mixed-attainment pupils. The teacher has been trying to encourage effective collaborative talk throughout a range of different tasks during the year.

<strong>How might Sarah make use of the strategies in this summary?</strong>
$CTA

Collaborative learning and dialogue are both effective ways of developing pupils’ learning at different stages, but are particularly helpful in supporting your pupils with practice. The evidence also highlights the importance of explicitly teaching and supporting both collaborative learning and classroom talk.

**Collaborative learning** involves pupils working together, in pairs or small groups, where everyone can participate on a collective activity. This may involve each pupil taking responsibility for a part of the activity or all pupils working together on the same activity. The impact of collaborative learning approaches is typically positive, but studies find a wide range of effects. This suggests that it is important to consider how to do it most effectively.

To help you to establish collaborative learning which is effective and efficient, you should:

- provide support and practice – effective collaborative learning requires more than just asking pupils to work together (e.g. explicitly teach routines and expectations, and repeat these each time you ask your pupils to work collaboratively)
- carefully design tasks – collaborative learning will be ineffective if tasks are not designed so that pupils can work together effectively and efficiently. If this is not done, some pupils may opt to try and work alone (e.g. provide specific roles and responsibilities; rotate these so that the same pupils don’t get type-cast in the same roles; to avoid drifting off task, be strict on timing and clear about expected outcomes)
- carefully group pupils – one of the benefits of collaborative learning is that pupils of different attainment levels can benefit from working with each other. Give consideration to the impact of specific grouping on behaviour and motivation (e.g. before grouping by friendship, ask yourself if this is likely to help or hinder their work)
- use competition purposefully – competition can be an effective way of enhancing collaborative learning. However, it is not essential and it is likely to be unhelpful if competition becomes a distraction from the intended learning. (Carefully monitoring the impact of competition is likely to be useful: not all pupils respond positively to competition.)

$CTA

<strong>
  Which of these strategies might Sarah consider essential for her geography
  class, and which might she think are desirable? Which might she avoid?
</strong>
$CTA

**Classroom talk** refers to the use of vocabulary and the quality of discussion by pupils as well as teachers. Encouraging pupils to use specific vocabulary and terminology during discussion in class helps to normalise and embed new words and improve the development of deep understanding. It broadens pupils’ vocabulary and helps them to articulate high-level ideas. Spoken language underpins both reading and writing development. Quality pupil talk positively affects academic attainment across the curriculum and children’s social and emotional development.

To help develop quality classroom talk, you should:

- carefully consider how ground rules and pupil reflection can help build a supportive environment for talk (e.g. by agreeing on class rules for talk and keeping them on display)
- create shared expectations and routines, such as listening to and respecting everyone, to support high-quality classroom talk. (E.g. introducing specific frameworks and approaches that pupils can use to guide their talk. This may be as simple as providing specialist vocabulary or sentence stems to develop pupils’ thinking.)
- model polite, constructive talk by insisting on rules for turn-taking. (This can be more than ‘hands up’ – for example, it could include handovers such as ‘I agree with Sara because...I would like to challenge what Sami said...’)

<h3>
  What Sarah did with her Year 11 geographers – Sarah explains her thinking
</h3>
‘I have been trying to encourage effective collaborative talk throughout a range
of different tasks during the year. In GCSE geography, it’s a great way to get pupils
to articulate the key ideas, consolidate their understanding and extend their vocabulary,
because they have to explain their thinking to their peers.

‘Mine is a mixed-attainment group; I have to pay close attention to the impact my groupings have on pupil attainment, their behaviour and motivation. I have a couple of pupils with tricky behaviour in there: they respond much better when they are familiar with routines. So, at the start of the year, I set up a system of grouping pupils into one of five ‘home’ and ‘away’ discussion groups. The 5 ‘home’ groups were named after continents, and the ‘away’ groups were named after ecosystems. The pupils had their ‘home’ and ‘away’ group name written on the front of their file. The ‘home’ groups were mixed attainment groups, whereas the ‘away’ groups were based on prior attainment levels. In order to do this I also had to take into account the pupils’ prior knowledge of the topic. The pupils feel a sense of responsibility towards their groups, which I occasionally reinforce with competition. I am certain this has boosted their intrinsic motivation.

‘I never do collaborative work just for the sake of it: it must always be about thinking harder about and achieving a deeper understanding of the subject and the exam. For this, they need guidance, support and practice. So, in the first stage of the lesson on different economic and social measures of development, pupils worked in ‘home’ groups. They were given a range of keywords, definitions and pictures which exemplified the core concepts of the lesson. Once they had developed their understanding of these concepts, I questioned the different groups about each measure of development to further embed their understanding. In the second phase of the lesson I told them to move into their away groups. At this point I gave a series of differentiated questions set to challenge the different prior attainment groups in the class. In the final stages of the lesson, I asked them to create their own ‘best’ measure of development.’

<h3>
  Ben, an A-Level history teacher, shares another approach to high-quality group
  talk
</h3>
<strong>The issue</strong>: In A-Level history, pupils are required to make judgements
about the validity of general statements and the claims of other historians. My Year
12s were preparing for an essay answering the question “Was Henry VIII’s foreign
policy from 1509-1527 a success?”

<strong>How he grouped them</strong>: I put pupils into groups of mixed ability
based on how they had tackled their previous essay. Person 1 in each group had
the weakest skills in this area, Person 4 had the strongest.

We used the following scaffold to structure discussion.

‘What would “success” look like for Henry VIII in terms of his foreign policy 1509–1527?’

<ol>
  <li>Suggest a definition for success.</li>
  <li>
    Ask a question about the definition – Person 1 should respond to your
    question.
  </li>
  <li>Suggest a change to the definition in the light of this discussion.</li>
  <li>
    Ask a further question about the definition and then draft a final
    definition which the whole group should then agree before all writing down
    an answer.
  </li>
</ol>
<strong>How he modelled group talk</strong>: As this was a skill that was not yet
totally embedded with this class, I had already scripted an exemplar discussion using
a similar question about ‘Henry VII’s foreign policy’ and we modelled this with one
of the groups. This helped to re-activate prior knowledge, provided some guidance
about the types of comments that could be made and gave additional support to pupils
who were not confident about the process.

<strong>Why it was successful</strong>: The success of the essay would rely on
pupils understanding the different concepts involved in this task. It doesn’t
focus specifically on knowledge - although a different task could - as this will
be the next stage in the process (having defined success – was it actually a
success?). (4.7)

By using the 1–4 approach and assigning different tasks or roles to each number it was possible to provide relevant challenge and support for each pupil based on their prior attainment. (4.10) This grouping was carefully assigned based on prior assessment and a secure knowledge of pupil ability in relation to this particular skill. (4o)

Providing a scaffold for discussion meant that all pupils were clear about their role in the discussion and it was clear that all pupils had a key role to play in the success of the activity. (4.9) Once pupils are confident with this approach (as a result of opportunities to practise) then it may not be necessary to include the worked examples as part of the set-up and ultimately, pupils should be able to have these discussions without using the scaffold.

In addition to ensuring that all pupils were involved, this scaffold and the modelled approach increased the quality of discussion and the rigour of the dialogue as pupils were able to question, challenge assumptions and re-frame in the light of other people’s input. (4p)

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Self-assessment

In your context, consider how effectively you use classroom talk and how effective your guidance of paired/group activities is. For each of these statements, place a cross on the line to best reflect your current practice. You could either do this for a single lesson/single class or for your teaching as a whole.

---

Classroom talk is always carefully structured and modelled, and has a focused purpose. Consideration is made to its specific purpose or structure

Summarise your reflections from this activity in your Learning Log. If you have considered one class or group of pupils, do you think that your responses would be the same when considering a different group?

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Independent planning

Planning for different groupings. Perhaps, in your self-assessment above, you said you ‘rarely’ give opportunities for structured classroom talk, or for collaborating in different grouping; or perhaps you said you ‘always’ do. You are now going to plan a lesson in two different ways. Use this opportunity to experiment a little:

- Think about a lesson that you will be delivering next week with a particular group of pupils.
- With a clear learning intention in mind produce two different ways of grouping your pupils (e.g. mixed attainment or near-attainment? Mixed gender or single gender? All in pairs, or all in fours? Or home and away groups, like Sarah?)
- Think about how the size of the groups and their prior attainment may affect motivation and behaviour.
- For each grouping, summarise your thinking behind the grouping and what you intend the outcomes to be for each group/sub-set of pupils.

An interesting development here would be to try and create the worst possible groupings and explain why these groupings might not work – in doing this you will be considering (and then ignoring) all of the key considerations for effective group work. We are not suggesting that you should teach this deliberately poorly grouped lesson!

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Be ready to share this, and your other learning from this session, with your mentor in your next meeting with them.

## Introduction

In your recent mentor session, you focused in detail on the role of key professionals and how to break content down for different pupils. You discussed the need to locate the education of children with SEND within inclusive policy and practice, with emphasis on improving the whole learning environment and the combination of teaching and learning processes applicable to all children. This is an approach that should serve to prevent some children from needing to be identified as having special educational needs.

In this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of teaching pupils with special educational needs. You will consider where to access the information you need to inform planning and explore the range of strategies that can be deployed when teaching pupils with a variety of different needs and backgrounds. Alongside this you will also consider again the importance of grouping pupils effectively.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice.** When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

$CTA
Molly is a Year 8 pupil with a moderate learning difficulty. She has been identified as having limited working memory capacity, which means she has difficulty in memorising important concepts and factual information crucial to her success in most subjects. Teachers regularly observe that Molly will remember something within a lesson, and a day later appears to have no recollection of this information.

<strong>
  What challenges could this difficulty pose for Molly if you were teaching her?
</strong>

<strong>
  What steps could be put in place during a lesson to ensure information is
  embedded for Molly?
</strong>
$CTA

**Barriers to learning** are specific factors which prevent pupils from making progress and acquiring new knowledge and skills. These can be additional learning needs such as dyslexia, or external factors such as bereavement or challenging home circumstances. There can also be barriers to learning within the classroom, such as poor behaviour or lack of facilities and equipment. A pupil’s socio-economic circumstances can also result in significant barriers to learning.

To help you identify and overcome pupils’ barriers to learning, you should:

- work closely with the SENCO, your Designated Safeguarding Lead and other special education professionals who work in or visit your school
- use the SEND Code of Practice, which has guidance on supporting SEND pupils
- learn more about your pupils’ barriers by liaising with their families and other colleagues
- if you have them, talk to teaching assistants or learning support advisors who may be keyworkers for the pupils you teach

$I
Molly’s teachers know that she has a moderate learning difficulty but they may not all understand what strategies have proven to work well for her. Specialist and experienced colleagues can help with this, such as the SENCO; the SEND Code of Practice contains practical guidance. Molly’s family have a lot of insight into what helps their daughter succeed; they can help guide her at home as well as talking to her teachers about these strategies.
$I

One of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ **prior knowledge** within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there, rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load. When pupils encounter familiar problems, this activates information from long-term memory and supports working memory, where problem-solving occurs. Novice pupils therefore find complex activities like problem-solving, critical thinking and creativity particularly effortful, as they have fewer experiences (and therefore less prior knowledge) and the problems they encounter are more likely to be novel. Where prior knowledge is weak, inaccurate or misapplied, it can have a distorting effect both on the immediate activity, and on the learning that results from this.

To help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils where they have specific learning needs, you should:

- wherever possible, talk to colleagues who taught them before, or who teach them in other areas now, so you can benefit from their experience
- carefully assess their prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (you may have to adapt your teaching in-lesson, as you realise that their prior knowledge is not secure)
- provide explicit modelling and guidance, breaking problems down into steps (e.g. keywords and sentence starters for written work, simple teacher demonstration for practical tasks)
- use worked examples with clear and minimal steps (including step-by-step visual guides)
- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (if you are able to co-plan with colleagues, that will help here)
- give them regular purposeful practice so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory

$CTA

<strong>
  Which of these strategies would be likely to be effective with Molly?
</strong>
$CTA

**Adaptive teaching** involves the teacher being flexible and responsive about the methods they use in lessons, to ensure that they can meet the needs of all their pupils and deviate from the lesson plan where necessary. Adaptive teaching requires a reflective approach, since the teacher needs to be able to acknowledge the need to change the strategy being used. Although adaptive teaching is easier with experience, it can be achieved early in a teacher’s career through careful planning – by anticipating pupil misconceptions before they arise, for example. It is important that this be done in response to pupils’ needs, not an artificial process which breaks the flow of the lesson. Adaptive teaching includes providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, but creating separate distinct tasks for different groups is less likely to be valuable: it risks lowering expectations for some, and it can add unnecessarily to workload.

To adapt your teaching without creating separate distinct tasks you should:

- intervene within lessons with individuals and small groups (e.g. as Mr Andrews did with Molly)
- divide your support between the whole class, specific groups and individuals (e.g. it is often possible to set up a whole-class independent task, freeing you to give extra support to a group or individual)
- while maintaining high expectations for all, you can vary the quantity of work you demand from some or the amount of time you allow some to complete it
- use and reuse templates, writing frames, key concepts mats and other worked examples as scaffolds you can easily introduce or withdraw as you adapt your teaching

$I
Mr Andrews (as you will see next) mainly adapted his teaching for Molly in this lesson by dividing his support between her and the whole class, and by using visual prompts as a scaffold he could introduce and gradually remove.
$I

Deliberate, purposeful **practice** is essential if pupils are to retain the new knowledge and skills they have been taught. This requires the pupils themselves to put sustained effort into improving their performance within a given domain. Deliberate practice is positively correlated with performance. Each time memories are recalled, they are strengthened. In order to embed new learning in their long-term memory and be able to retrieve it for future use, pupils need to regularly retrieve new knowledge and skills, and apply them in new and diverse contexts.

To help your pupils with specific learning needs to learn through practice you should:

- design learning sequences that give your pupils regular opportunities to practise, and to retrieve from memory what they have previously learned (so much the better if you can make this low-stakes and low-stress)
- design practice tasks to ensure a high success rate for your pupils, but
- over time, increase the challenge, for example by removing scaffolding or by increasing the length of time between visits to the topic.

$I
Mr Andrews planned a Year 8 lesson on the ‘problems of living in a city’. The pupils were provided with several paragraphs of information on the given topic. Pupils needed to break down the information via a series of small illustrations/symbols, which would later serve as visual memory prompts. Pupils could write only a maximum of four key words to support their work.

<ul>
  <li>
    For Molly, the next step to secure this knowledge further was to have her
    use her illustrations and word prompts to recall this information verbally
    to a study partner, before attempting any comprehension work or written work
    about the topic. Beforehand, Mr Andrews modelled for them how he wanted them
    to conduct their paired talk. He knows that pairings such as this can
    increase success for Molly, but also that he needs to give her and her
    partner clear guidance. He has discovered that, for now at least, this
    pairing seems to have improved the behaviour and motivation of both Molly
    and her partner, but he is keeping an eye on this and will assess the impact
    also on their attainment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using easy visual prompts gave Molly an extra step in embedding the
    information. Using these regularly across a series of lessons, and gradually
    taking the visual prompts away, ensured Molly could transfer this
    information more easily into her long-term memory. Mr Andrews is prepared to
    give Molly this specific type of support because he is aware that she learns
    at a different rate to most of the other pupils in the class.
  </li>
</ul>

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Self-assessment

Which aspects of the research and practice summary – or of the example of Molly’s geography teacher – are most relevant to the challenges you are experiencing in your teaching at the moment?

Note in your Learning Log the two or three key messages you are taking away for your own teaching. For example, what insights has it given you for how you support pupils with specific needs through:

- how you group your class
- what you know about the different levels of support they need
- understanding their barriers to learning
- how you guide them in group and paired activities
- liaising with colleagues and families
- adapting your practice without creating separate tasks

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Focus on a specific group of pupils or a class. Below are a set of ‘challenges’, for which you have to plan your practical response. You may want to dwell on some more than others. Some hints are given.

## Introduction

In the last mentor session, your mentor focused in more detail on the practical implications of supporting all learners, including those with SEND. They assisted you in refining activities and approaches to be tried in the classroom.

In your self-directed study session, you will consider how establishing pupils’ prior knowledge is an essential part of teaching, that different pupils have differing levels of prior knowledge and that this affects the rate at which they learn. You might further apply your knowledge of how flexible grouping can impact upon pupil achievement. You consider again the adapted support that pupils with barriers to learning, including SEND, may need to progress in their learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>
  Teaching new vocabulary to a group with a wide range of needs – a Year 5 class
</h3>
Miss Gascoigne has a Year 5 class consisting of pupils with a variety of learning
needs. She is beginning a new topic – the Ancient Egyptians – which will require
pupils to understand challenging vocabulary and employ it with accuracy in their
own writing.

<strong>
  Which of the strategies in this summary could she use to plan for the needs of
  her class?
</strong>
$CTA

**Pre-teaching** is the process of teaching a new concept to selected pupils prior to a lesson on the subject. This might, for example, involve teaching new vocabulary or a new mathematical concept before the first lesson on a topic, so that pupils who may otherwise struggle are able to access and keep up with the learning. The approach works equally well for all pupils.

Further examples of pre-teaching include:

- setting pre-reading as homework, so that pupils are more able to engage with the vocabulary and ideas in the lesson itself (this can be supported by parents/carers)
- independent research into a topic (e.g., the works of a famous artist, designer or musician) as a stimulus for the following lesson

$CTA

<strong>
  Do you think Miss Gascoigne is likely to want to pre-teach the vocabulary for
  the new topic?
</strong>
$CTA

As you have seen already, one of the most important aspects of teaching is the ability to establish an accurate understanding of the pupils’ prior knowledge within a given subject or domain. In this way, the teacher can start with where their pupils are and help them from there, rather than working backwards from a long-term learning goal. It is also understood that increased prior knowledge reduces working memory load. As children develop, they accrue more knowledge across a range of contexts, and this reduces the load on their working memory, allowing them to solve problems more rapidly.

To help you address the prior knowledge needs of your pupils, particularly as they learn at different rates, you should:

- wherever possible, talk to colleagues who taught them before, or who teach them in other areas now, so you can benefit from their experience
- carefully assess their prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce (you may have to adapt your teaching in lesson, as you realise that their prior knowledge is not secure)
- provide explicit modelling and guidance, breaking problems down into steps (e.g., keywords and sentence starters for written work, simple teacher demonstration for practical tasks)
- use worked examples with clear and minimal steps (including step-by-step visual guides)
- identify likely misconceptions and plan to prevent them from occurring (if you are able to co-plan with colleagues, that will help here)
- give them regular purposeful practice so they can consolidate learning in their long-term memory

$I
Before beginning the topic, Miss Gascoigne does a word reading test to identify vocabulary that is familiar to pupils and to what extent they understand it. The list included: archaeology, pyramid, pharaoh, slavery, River Nile, and Nefertiti. Her aim is for pupils to be able to identify words and then be able to place them in context and remember them. This will reduce the load on their working memory as they learn new information. This small piece of pre-teaching allowed her to circumvent some of the misconceptions that may have become established.
$I

**Formative assessment** (or assessment for learning) is used to directly inform the teaching and learning process (i.e. when evidence gathered on pupils is used to make adaptations to teaching and learning). Dylan Wiliam describes it in terms of how ‘teachers and learners use information about student achievement, to make adjustments to the student’s learning that improve their achievement.’

To support pupil learning through effective formative assessment, you could draw on five key strategies for embedding formative assessment, outlined by Dylan Wiliam:

- clarifying, understanding and sharing learning intentions (e.g., by sharing clear success criteria for pupils at the outset of learning activities)
- engineering effective classroom discussions, tasks and activities that elicit evidence of learning (e.g., by using questioning and other forms of gathering information on pupil learning regularly throughout and across lessons)
- providing feedback that moves learners forward (e.g., by being explicit about what pupils should do next to improve their learning)
- activating students as learning resources for one another (e.g., by explicitly teaching strategies, such as peer-assessment)
- activating students as owners of their own learning (e.g., by explicitly teaching pupils strategies to monitor and regulate their own learning)

You will return to formative and other forms of assessment in Module 4.

<strong>
  Why is formative assessment so important to Miss Gascoigne as she teaches her
  pupils the vocabulary for the new topic?
</strong>
$CTA

**Reframing questions** is more than simply rewording them. If a pupil can’t answer a question, reframing it can allow them to approach it from a different angle. For example, rather than asking a pupil to ‘explain their reasoning’ for statement X, the teacher might ask them to provide reasons for and against believing statement X to be true. This may help the pupil realise they don’t always have to align themselves with one particular line of reasoning, and to view problems and topics more holistically. Reframing questions can also help the teacher diagnose barriers to learning and help pupils think problems through rather than simply giving up at the first sign of difficulty.

To help all your pupils make better progress, you can reframe questions to:

- provide more support for those who need it by offering greater scaffolding (e.g., by narrowing down the options in an answer: ‘What were causes of the Great War?... Name me an important cause of the War... Was it important that the great powers had been building up their armies and navies before the War?’)
- stretch those pupils who are ready for it (e.g., by politely challenging their reasoning: ‘Shamim, why do some people in the class disagree with your answer?... Shamim, try to change my mind about this...’)

**Relationships** between teachers and **parents/carers** are generally considered crucial to a child’s educational experience. Sometimes, we use other terms to mean similar things (e.g., parental involvement, engagement, participation). Attending a parents’ evening may be considered as ‘parental involvement’ with the school, whilst parents/carers regularly reading with their child would come under the heading of ‘parental engagement’ with learning. Building effective relationships with families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success; it can help teachers to better understand their pupils’ individual circumstances so that they can be effectively supported in school. Schools always need to nurture their relationships with families, but this is probably even more important for families of children with special educational needs or disabilities.

To help you to build effective relationships with parents, carers and families, you should:

- speak to the pastoral teams in your school and get their advice
- prepare well for parents’ evenings, making sure you know well what your pupils’ strengths are, what they need to do to improve and what families might be able to do to help
- where you have concerns about how best to communicate with a family, ask a trusted colleague to help you to script some scenarios

Schools work with parents/carers in diverse ways depending upon the community in which they serve. The Education Endowment Foundation’s (2015) ‘Working with parents to support children’s learning’ is a very useful guidance report.

$I
After the pre-lesson word reading test, Miss Gascoigne sent the test home with the pupils with a request that parents rehearse the words with their children.

By identifying the prior knowledge of her pupils, Miss Gascoigne was able to plan effectively for the range of needs in the classroom, using strategies to both support and challenge pupils learning at different rates. To ensure mastery of more complex vocabulary, she used a range of strategies:

<ul>
  <li>she explained the meaning with child-friendly definitions</li>
  <li>she provided examples of how the vocabulary is used</li>
  <li>she asked the children to repeat the word at least 3 times</li>
  <li>
    she planned activities to use the word correctly (verbal sentences,
    sentences on whiteboard, word searches, act out the word, close texts)
  </li>
  <li>
    to support their long-term memory, the vocabulary was posted on a word wall,
    and the words were reviewed daily for a week or so<em>.</em>
  </li>
</ul>
Before teaching the topic, Miss Gascoigne conducted a word reading test because she
realised that, for many, lack of prior knowledge of the words would be a barrier
to their learning on the topic. This test also doubled as a form of pre-teaching,
which was an extra assistance for those who are learning at a different rate. Because
she has built good relations with the parents of her pupils, she was confident of
their support when she sent the word test home for them to rehearse with their children.
The range of strategies that she then used in the lesson supported all the pupils
to expand their working vocabularies. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Action planning

Think about a lesson that you are going to be teaching soon and have in mind 3 different pupils. These should be pupils who learn at different rates and normally require different levels and types of support to succeed. Quickly fill in this grid on the 3 pupils A, B and C.

|                                 | A   | B   | C   |
| ------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Levels of support they need     |     |     |     |
| Barriers to learning            |     |     |     |
| Your prior contact with family  |     |     |     |
| Likely prior knowledge of topic |     |     |     |

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Scripting

You are going to script certain parts of the lesson that you had in mind from the Plan section above. The scripts will help you understand and build upon the pupils’ prior knowledge.

You are going to use some of the strategies of Dylan Wiliam, as described in the Research and Practice Summary. You will remember, as you script, your 3 pupils A, B and C, and that:

- 5.1 pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
- 5.2 seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching
- 5.7 pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential

| Parts of the lesson                  | Ideas for your script                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Introducing learning intentions      | Who can tell me what our learning intentions mean?                                                          |
| Asking and responding to questions   | Would someone like to agree with C’s answer there, and give a reason?                                       |
| Giving instructions                  | Now you have heard the instruction from me, tell your partner in your own words what it is I want you to do |
| Setting up peer- and self-assessment | What were the 3 best parts of the work? What one thing would make it better?                                |

You are going to share your scripts with your mentor in your next meeting.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

To prepare for your next mentor meeting, write in your Learning Log any questions you want to ask your mentor that relate to this session’s learning intentions.

## Introduction

In the self-directed study sessions from Week 9 and follow-up meetings with your mentor, you looked at how to make use of formative assessment and adapt lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations. In your script, you reframed questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch.

In this self-study session you will extend your knowledge of why it is important to evaluate pupils’ knowledge, understanding and skills - this could be via discussions with pupils, during whole class feedback, checking classwork or summative assessment of their work. When certain pupils need more help to improve their knowledge, understanding and skills, it is crucial that the teacher identifies what help they need and the best way to adapt their teaching to support them. It is best if this does not involve creating a separate lesson plan, tasks or set of resources. The idea that lessons need to cater for pupils’ ‘learning styles’ has been debunked and does not improve learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

<h3>
  Making new concepts accessible through targeted support – Year 12 Psychology
</h3>
Conn is struggling with his Year 12 A Level Psychology class: the pupils are having
difficulties communicating their prior understanding of complex concepts and so are
failing to apply this knowledge to solving problems. He has tried a number of things,
including personalising resources for each member of the class and teaching them
according to what they have told him are their preferred learning styles. He is now
overloaded with work and still not happy with the progress his pupils are making.

<strong>
  Why might pupils be struggling to communicate their prior knowledge?
</strong>

<strong>
  Why might Conn’s hard work not be producing the outcomes he wants?
</strong>

<strong>
  How might he better target his support so that the pupils access the new
  concepts?
</strong>

<strong>
  Which of the strategies in this summary could he use to plan for the needs of
  his class?
</strong>
$CTA

**Adaptive teaching** involves the teacher being flexible and responsive about the methods they use in lessons to ensure that they can meet the needs of all their pupils and deviate from the lesson plan where necessary. Adaptive teaching requires a reflective approach, since the teacher needs to be able to acknowledge the need to change the strategy being used. Although adaptive teaching is easier with experience, it can be achieved early in a teacher’s career through careful planning – by anticipating pupil misconceptions before they arise, for example. It is important that this is done in response to pupils’ needs, not an artificial process which breaks the flow of the lesson.

Adaptive teaching includes providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, but creating separate, distinct tasks for different groups is less likely to be valuable: it risks lowering expectations for some, and it can add unnecessarily to workload.

To help your pupils make progress you should:

- use formative assessment to identify those who need content further broken down
- adapt your lessons but keep your expectations high for all
- change your groups frequently
- rather than plan different tasks and lessons, intervene within lessons with individuals and small groups

$I
Conn changed his approach. Alongside better scaffolding of information, the teacher decided to group his pupils based on current assessment data. In order to target his support, he planned a group work lesson on ‘attachment’, which used a variety of scaffolding prompts to remind the students of the concepts and knowledge required to show an understanding of attachment. These prompts included a short video on the ‘nature v nurture’ debate and some key associated words such as ‘secure’ and ‘insecure avoidant’ and ‘insecure resistant’. He stopped planning towards his pupils’ preferred learning styles because it wasn’t helping.
$I

**Critical knowledge** is the essential information and concepts pupils need to learn the next steps in an area of the curriculum. It is linked to the idea of foundational concepts. Critical knowledge might be a key concept or piece of vocabulary, for example, or a mathematical process without which the next steps can’t be made.

It is important that the curriculum is carefully sequenced so that pupils learn **foundational concepts** first – concepts that are needed in order to understand more complex information. Examples of foundational concepts include learning the alphabet and phonetic sounds in literacy; learning to count, add and subtract in mathematics; and learning about cells and atoms in science. Over time, building up foundational understanding can help pupils develop confidence in their ability to recall relevant information while their knowledge gradually becomes more complex, and external support (or scaffolding) is gradually withdrawn.

To help your pupils master foundational concepts, you should:

- with your colleagues, identify what these are and ensure they are prioritised in your curriculum
- with your colleagues, identify the likely common misconceptions that can hamper understanding of the important concepts
- give concrete examples and metaphors as these are often useful in helping pupils understand abstract concepts (e.g., stories and narratives, sayings, rules, mnemonics, equations and models)

$I
Conn’s pupils were able to use the scaffolds and prompts to access their prior understanding and work collaboratively to produce a labelled diagram of nature versus nurture. By using current assessment data, he was able to identify knowledge gaps that were common across particular groups of pupils and group them according to their more specific needs. Conn was able to focus more time in lesson to help specific groups develop their diagrams. He could reframe questions and give extra modelling to the groups with struggling pupils when required to maintain the level of discussion in the group and promote deeper understanding. He didn’t produce a different lesson plan or resources for them or have a separate set of learning outcomes. Instead, he focused on foundational concepts. Other groups could work independently of the teacher, without additional scaffolding, to complete the finished product.

During the lesson, the teacher moved around the room and used questioning to check individual pupils’ understanding. By doing this, he was able to identify where additional/less scaffolding was required and adapt his intervention accordingly.
$I

$I

<h3>
  What did Conn learn about making new concepts accessible through targeted
  support?
</h3>
Conn saved time by not producing extra resources for the class, instead refocusing
his attention in lesson to target his support where it was needed. Grouping his pupils
using their current assessment data helped him to achieve this in a way that meant
he did not need to have separate learning objectives or resources. He learned that
teaching to preferred learning styles didn’t help the pupils and only added to his
workload. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

**Analyse artefacts**

Conn adapted his teaching, and avoided having to produce separate lesson resources, by distributing his attention across the groups he had formed using his Year 12 current assessment data. He was able to teach his class the new concepts they needed. Another way to achieve this outcome is by making adaptive use of a teaching resource.

Think of a lesson that you have coming up, or a topic that you will need to teach soon. Find a single rich resource that you can use to teach your whole class. It might be a textbook or a curriculum resource that already exists in a shared staff area; alternatively, it could be an online resource such as a video or animation.

### Theory to Practice 20 mins

**1. Independent planning**

Write a plan for a lesson that will be observed by your mentor (or you can record a 15-minute section of the lesson.) The purpose of this observation is to demonstrate specific targeted support to groups of pupils with the aim of encouraging the learning of the key concepts but without having to artificially produce separate resources or tasks. You will use the single rich resource you found above.

You should think about what you have learned about adaptive teaching, e.g.,

- how you identify pupils who need extra support
- how you identify what they need extra support with
- how you give the extra support, without creating additional resources and tasks but by adapting the single rich resource for all pupils
- how you might use more intensive pre-teaching, peer-assisted learning, small group discussions or additional homework and questions

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Arrange to record 15 minutes of this lesson or for your mentor or another colleague to observe 15 minutes of it. If neither is possible, make sure you write a detailed lesson plan, and then annotate it later with notes on how the strategies you tried succeeded or not.

## Introduction

In the self-directed study from Week 10 and follow-up meeting with your mentor, you looked at adaptive teaching and the importance of identifying the critical knowledge pupils need in order to access the curriculum. You reflected on your own practice both in the classroom and by looking at examples of planning.

In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of meeting the individual needs of pupils and balancing your workload by focusing on high-quality exposition and efficiency. Classroom dialogue is important and striking the balance between teacher-talk, pupil-talk and independent work is crucial in ensuring pupils are well supported and challenged in their learning.

You can apply insights from these exercises to examples from your own past experience with pupils and to future lesson plans.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>High-Quality Expositions and Efficiency – Year 9 English</h3>
Mrs Turner has found that her Year 9 English class are struggling to grasp some foundational
concepts in the current scheme of learning on War Poetry. They produce a lot of written
work but when she has marked their books, she has found that there are misconceptions
and misunderstandings. She has spent a lot of time during the lesson explaining background
information to the concepts but the pupils’ knowledge hasn’t improved.

<strong>
  What strategies could Mrs Turner employ to tackle these problems?
</strong>

**Efficiency** can be thought of as ‘the reduction of waste’. The most common resource that can be wasted in teaching is time, leading to an overall increase in teachers’ workload. Reducing wasted time is a key priority for teachers and school leaders.

It can be helpful to think of efficiency as the relationship between time taken and quality of outcome, because it doesn’t always follow that reducing time spent on an activity is a good thing per se. Teaching is intellectual labour, and some parts of a teacher’s work take time because they are hard to do well. For example, when planning to introduce a new foundational concept, rushing the planning of a lesson may mean that pupils do not learn that concept well, affecting many future lessons.

Schools and multi-academy trusts develop their own policies and practices around assessment, marking and feedback. They are encouraged to be mindful of the impact upon teacher workload of assessment practices, which can be onerous. Teachers need to be aware of their school’s expectations of marking and should also seek ways of minimising the potentially negative impacts of doing it excessively. Self- and peer-assessment both have pedagogical advantages and can help reduce marking workload.

To help you save time without significantly impacting the quality of outcomes, you could make marking manageable and effective by:

- recording data only when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes
- working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback (e.g., using whole-class feedback via a visualiser, or well-supported peer- and self-assessment)
- using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons where possible. (Some schools may encourage using verbal feedback stamps, but remember this also uses up time and may not help improve outcomes for your pupils)
- using departmental or phase team time to moderate and standardise assessment (this is also a great form of subject-specific professional development)

And you can make planning manageable by:

- making use of existing well-designed resources (e.g., textbooks, exam board-approved exemplars, online stores of graphics and animations, carefully selected commercial schemes of work)
- doing it collaboratively with colleagues (e.g., during shared PPA time or during time set aside for department/phase development)

<strong>
  Which strategies might be effective in reducing wasted time both in and out of
  lessons?
</strong>
$CTA

It is important that the curriculum is carefully sequenced so that pupils learn** foundational concepts** first – concepts that are needed in order to understand more complex information. Examples of foundational concepts include learning the alphabet and phonetic sounds in literacy; learning to count, add and subtract in mathematics; and learning about cells and atoms in science. Over time, building up foundational understanding can help pupils develop confidence in their ability to recall relevant information while their knowledge gradually becomes more complex, and external support (or scaffolding) is gradually withdrawn.

To help your pupils to master foundational concepts, you should:

- with your colleagues, identify what these are and ensure they are prioritised in your curriculum
- with your colleagues, identify the likely common misconceptions that can hamper understanding of the important concepts
- give concrete examples and metaphors as these are often useful in helping pupils understand abstract concepts (e.g., stories and narratives, sayings, rules, mnemonics, equations and models)

Mrs Turner decided to take a look at the scheme of learning and identify where there may be misconceptions and misunderstandings in future lessons. A key problem pupils had was understanding historical context in relation to the themes of the text they were studying. She identified potential pitfalls in future lessons and found time to sit with her class’s history teacher, who helped her locate a five-minute video which depicted conditions in trenches on the Western Front. He also gave her a history textbook from which she was able to compile a glossary of key terms, such as ‘trench-foot’, ‘morning hate’ and ‘no man’s land’. Collaborating with this teacher saved them both time, as he now has a better idea of the war poetry they study. Mrs Turner was able to create resources to support and challenge her pupils.
$I

**Exposition** refers to the process of explaining concepts, ideas and information with great clarity. It requires the teacher to have sound knowledge of the curriculum area and involves ensuring that pupils are able to understand new information in the context of their prior knowledge and understanding. Exposition is about more than simply telling pupils information. It also involves providing examples to illustrate and illuminate the material to be learned. Examples can include visual and conceptual models, application of rules, and contextual information. Good exposition may also involve modelling. Exposition does not require pupils to make discoveries themselves: by moving from the general to the specific, it allows pupils to understand increasingly detailed explanations of the material to be learned and link those explanations to information presented previously as part of a general overview.

To help your pupils learn through more effective exposition, you should:

- plan what you are going to say and how you are going to model to your pupils (e.g., by rehearsing how you will explain foundational concepts)
- think about the visuals and examples you can use that will help your pupils connect this new learning with that they already know
- be prepared to break down your expositions further for those pupils who may need it
- allow time also for pupils to practise: don’t simply rely upon exposition (in your plan, allot a time limit to your expositions; this will help you keep to your point)

$I

<h3>What Mrs Turner did</h3>
Mrs Turner showed the five-minute video she had borrowed from her history colleague
to her class, at the end of the previous lesson. She said she would be quizzing them
on it in the next lesson. She also gave them the glossary of terms connected with
trench warfare for them to learn at home.

She started her next lesson with the promised quiz on the video. She rearranged the pupils’ seating plan as a result, creating a ‘support table’ for those who had done less well on the quiz. She showed the video to the whole class again because she believed that would ease the load on their working memories. In her plan, she scripted her main exposition to the class, being careful to include several of the terms from the glossary and to connect these to the concepts she wanted them to grapple with in 2 poems by Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. This all took 15 minutes, and she was able to allow her pupils to spend most of the remainder of the lesson on independent practice, first in groups of four to generate and refine ideas, and then individually. Mrs Turner was able to use the independent practice time to target her support on the ‘support table’ of pupils who had done less well on the video quiz. With them, she reused her quiz questions and glossary as the main resources to re-teach them.

Mrs Turner recognised that her class’s hard work was not the same as effective learning: they were still stumbling over foundational concepts, even though they were producing a lot of writing. She used the resources of her history colleague – the video and glossary – knowing that they would be of high quality and pitched correctly for the age of her pupils. She used these to pre-teach (through homework and the last few minutes of the previous lesson) some of the keywords and concepts she would need her class to be familiar with. That meant in her lesson, through the quiz and exposition, she was able to connect new content to their existing knowledge. Her exposition was brief and – because she had scripted it – she made sure it was to the point. This allowed her class plenty of time to work independently. In turn, this afforded her the chance to give extra in-class support to the group who had struggled with the quiz on the video. Rather than create new resources for them, she reused the same materials as with the whole of the class. This made more efficient use of her planning time.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Analyse artefact

Examine your schemes of learning for the next few weeks. Identify an upcoming area of the curriculum where there may well be misconceptions which arise in the course of covering new learning over 3 lessons. You may wish to discuss this with a more experienced colleague or someone (e.g., Mrs Turner’s history colleague) more familiar with the topic.

As an alternative, you can do the same exercise with a textbook which will cover several of your upcoming lessons.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Action planning

Annotate the scheme of learning (or textbook) for the 3 lessons. Start with the foundational concepts (these may already be identified). What are the potential misconceptions arising from these concepts? How will you explain them, and what resources will you need? How will you plan for these lessons and be efficient with resources and time?

Make notes of your ideas on a table like this:

| Foundational Concepts | Potential Misconceptions | Potential resources/ expositions | Efficient? (my workload) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
|                       |                          |                                  |                          |

Bring these notes to your next mentor meeting.

## Introduction

In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of the fundamental principles of assessment. You will speak to a colleague about the different ways that they use assessment in their practice. You will then consider the learning objectives for a forthcoming lesson and select three different age-appropriate assessment strategies, evaluating their effectiveness. This activity will be supported further during your subsequent mentor meeting.

In your ECT mentor meeting this week, you will discuss and complete the Module 4 self-assessment audit to identify what you already know about effective teaching (learn that) and the skills you are developing as a teacher (learn how to). You and your mentor will use the outcome of the audit to inform your use of materials in this module. You will return to the audit as you work through Module 4, using it to chart your progress.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Questioning for assessment in a Year 11 history lesson</h3>
Seda wants to introduce a topic on the Puritan Threat, part of a unit on Elizabethan
England. Pupils have already studied the Religious Settlement and Catholic Threat,
so they have some knowledge of the Puritans. Seda is keen to identify any misconceptions
pupils have acquired in order to plan the subsequent lessons to correct them. She’s
taught this topic before and knows that pupils typically struggle with some of the
core ideas underpinning the topic.

<strong>
  What could Seda do to check her pupils’ existing understanding of these core
  ideas at the start of the topic?
</strong>
$CTA

**Assessment** is a broad term, covering a wide range of teaching and learning activity. ‘Assessment of learning’ (or summative assessment), used after a period of teaching/learning, aims to find out what pupils know or can do at a given point in time. ‘Assessment for learning’ (or formative assessment), used during a period of teaching/learning, aims to find out where pupils are now and where they need to go next, as well as to provide feedback on how to get there. Assessment may also be used to establish pupils’ prior knowledge and understanding at the outset of a sequence of learning. With these different purposes come different methods of assessment. Assessment can add significantly to a teacher’s workload, so it is important to become familiar with your school’s expectations and to learn efficient methods from colleagues.

Peer-assessment and self-assessment can be valuable tools that enable pupils to check their own progress against agreed success criteria. However, pupils first need to be trained in how to do this well, and the approaches work best alongside teacher assessment rather than as an alternative. These approaches are explored further in week 4 of this module.

**Formative assessment** (or assessment for learning) is assessment which is used to directly inform the teaching and learning process – i.e. when evidence gathered on pupils is used to make adaptations to teaching and learning. Dylan Wiliam describes it in terms of how ‘teachers and learners use information about student achievement to make adjustments to the student’s learning that improve their achievement.’

To support pupil learning through effective formative assessment, you could draw on five key strategies for embedding formative assessment, outlined by Dylan Wiliam, which are:

- clarifying, understanding and sharing learning intentions (e.g. by sharing clear success criteria for pupils at the outset of learning activities by using a checklist or by modelling ‘what a good one looks like’)
- engineering effective classroom discussions, tasks and activities that elicit evidence of learning (e.g. by regularly using questioning and other ways of gathering information on pupil learning throughout and across lessons - this could include: quizzes, observing pupils as they work independently or discuss ideas with peers, checking pupils’ work during lesson time to monitor their progress, structured class discussions)
- providing feedback that moves learners forward (e.g. by being explicit about what pupils should do next to improve their learning)
- activating students as learning resources for one another (e.g. by explicitly teaching strategies such as peer-assessment)
- activating students as owners of their own learning (e.g. by explicitly teaching pupils strategies to monitor and regulate their own learning)

$I
Seda could use these strategies with her class by planning some activities at the beginning of the topic which encourage pupils to share their current understanding about the core ideas. This would give her the information she needs to plan the rest of the topic. She could devise a few diagnostic questions and use whole-class response techniques to gather responses from all pupils. Pupils could respond by:

<ul>
  <li>
    writing short answers (up to a sentence) on a mini-whiteboard and holding
    these up so the teacher can see all answers at once
  </li>
  <li>
    using their fingers to respond to a multiple-choice question with numbered
    optional responses (i.e. if they think the answer is option 1, they hold up
    1 finger; if option 4, 4 fingers)
  </li>
</ul>
Before collecting answers from pupils, Seda could give them a chance to discuss their
ideas in small groups or with talk partners. This gives pupils a chance to share
their thinking in a low-stakes environment and build confidence before sharing their
answers with the whole class. $I

**Summative assessment** sums up, at a given time (for example, the end of a unit), where learners are in their learning. It is also referred to as ‘assessment of learning’, in contrast to ‘assessment for learning’. Summative assessments are often more useful and reliable when compared against an external benchmark and conducted in controlled conditions. This should improve the reliability of the information that the teacher gets from the assessment.

It can be helpful to schedule your summative assessment a little before the end of the time available for teaching a given topic (e.g. in week 4 of a 5-week topic). This allows time (e.g. in week 5) for you and your pupils to address any learning needs picked up in the assessment by revisiting content that pupils have learned less well.

To help you make effective summative assessments, you could:

- use externally validated materials where possible, such as a previous national test paper and mark scheme

- if several classes in one year group are to take the same summative assessment

  - give all the pupils the same notice and chance to prepare, so that you can compare across groups more accurately
  - work with your colleagues to plan the assessment, minimising excessive workload for individuals

**Questioning** is one way that teachers can check pupils’ prior knowledge and understanding and identify misconceptions or gaps in knowledge. Questions also have other purposes, as explored in Module 3.

Questions can be structured in different ways according to their purpose. Multiple-choice questions are useful for identifying common misconceptions and determining whether pupils can ‘recognise’ correct answers – a helpful stepping stone toward their being able to retrieve or recall information in the absence of retrieval cues. However, writing successful multiple-choice questions is complex if they are to be of most impact in both developing and assessing pupil learning. Hinge questions are a particular type of multiple-choice question that help teachers check whether pupils have understood important information that has to be mastered before moving on to the next part of the learning sequence. Hinge questions will be explored further in week 3 of Module 4.

To use questions to support the accurate and productive use of assessment, you could:

- use multiple-choice questions to identify knowledge gaps and misconceptions during lessons (a good source of well-constructed multiple-choice questions can be past examination papers, if these are available in your phase and specialism)
- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that correct answers stem from secure understanding (e.g. ‘tell me how you reached that answer’, ‘what tells you that this is the correct answer?’ or ‘can you explain to me why this answer is incorrect?’)

$I
High-quality multiple-choice questions make use of all options to tell the teacher something about pupils’ understanding:

<ul>
  <li>there can be one correct answer or more than one</li>
  <li>
    the incorrect answers, or ‘distractors’, are linked to common errors or
    misunderstandings - the design of these incorrect answers should be
    approached as carefully as the design of the correct answer(s)
  </li>
</ul>
By noting which incorrect answers pupils give, teachers can learn more about the
misunderstandings that pupils hold. This helps the teacher to decide what to do next
in their teaching.

In Seda’s case, she could use her knowledge of the typical errors that pupils have made when she taught this topic previously to help her to write a usefully diagnostic question, or questions, to frame her initial assessment of pupils’ understanding.
$I

**Performance** is used to describe ‘what a pupil can do at a given moment.’ How well they do in a test, for example, can be described as their performance. Teachers draw inferences about what pupils have learned by looking at their performance in assessments. Externally validated assessment instruments – exams and standardised tests – are useful for determining a pupil’s current level of performance within a particular domain. However, there are disadvantages to the use of high-stakes tests, since a single point of assessment (performance) is, by definition, not a reliable measure of what a pupil has really learned. It is therefore more valid and reliable to draw conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments. You will explore this idea further in the ECT training session for this module.

$I

<h3>What did Seda do? The principles of assessment in practice</h3>
Seda decides to write several multiple-choice questions as a starter activity, with
common misconceptions built into the distractors (wrong answers). Pupils quickly
tackle the questions. Seda asks them to then discuss and justify their answers with
their talk partners – talk partners are set by the seating plan and have been arranged
taking account of pupils’ prior attainment, behaviour for learning and personalities. She
circulates the room to listen to discussions, noting where pupils have strong understanding
in some cases and important misconceptions in others.

Seda selects some pairs to explain their answers to each question and the reasoning behind these answers. She uses further questioning and discussion to encourage pupils to expand on their answers and to highlight and correct the misconceptions she noted previously in relation to Puritan beliefs and roles in Elizabethan society.

Seda was aware of the typical confusion pupils experience in differentiating religious groups in Elizabethan England; she knew that identifying and clarifying those misconceptions was essential to pupils understanding the new topic. Using multiple-choice questioning with deliberate distractors allowed her to quickly identify her pupils’ prior knowledge and misconceptions so that these could be addressed before they interfered with the new topic. She wanted pupils to justify their answers to the multiple-choice questions in order to better understand why some may have confused their thinking and to reassure herself that others’ correct answers were built on secure knowledge. Doing this in talk partners gave less-confident pupils the opportunity to check understanding in a low-stakes way and the teacher the chance to monitor this. As a result of this lesson, Seda was able to better organise future lessons. In this case, she decided to incorporate some quizzes and concept-matching starter activities throughout the lesson sequence to revise the Puritans’ basic beliefs and to help her give more tailored support for those who needed the content further broken down.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Discuss with a colleague

Arrange to speak to an experienced colleague about how they use assessment in their practice.

Look for connections between the outcomes from this discussion and the research summary above. Make notes as appropriate in your Learning Log, if you are using one.

You could ask them:

- how they use formative assessment at the start of a topic to find out what pupils know already
- how they use formative assessment during a topic to monitor pupils’ progression
- how they use summative assessment at the end of a topic to make judgements about learning
- the factors they consider when selecting a formative or summative assessment tool to use in their teaching

If you are not able to speak to a colleague with the required expertise, you can refer to the video resources that accompany this session.

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### Practical exercise / independent planning

Select a lesson that you will be teaching soon. Look at the learning objectives (LOs) for this lesson and identify three different ways that you could assess pupils’ learning in relation to these LOs (for example: different types of questions, observation, quizzing, peer assessment task, self-assessment task, marking work).

Using the concepts in this week’s Research and Practice Summary and other knowledge that you have in this area, reflect on each of your chosen three options by completing the table below. Put an \* by the strategy that you think is the most effective strategy for this lesson, based on your assessment. The first row is an example of how Seda might complete the table for her topic about the Puritan threat.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your completed table and any supporting notes to your mentor meeting next week (this week, you will focus on the module audit). Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor. You should also bring any outcomes recorded in your Learning Log from your discussion with a colleague and be prepared to discuss how you have developed your knowledge and understanding in relation to the learning intentions
from this self-directed study session.

## Introduction

In the ECT training session in week 2 and the follow-up meeting with your mentor, you looked at the fundamental principles of effective assessment. In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of applying good assessment practice in the classroom. You will use your learning to develop an assessment plan for a few of your pupils. You will follow this up with your mentor in your next ECT mentor meeting.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Improving assessment in Year 4 science</h3>
Robbie recently taught a series of lessons about the digestive system to his Year
4 class and was really pleased with how things went. However, he was surprised when
the end-of-topic test revealed that pupils had not learnt what he wanted them to
learn – they had not understood core ideas about the digestive system. Over the topic,
pupils had done lots of writing and been really engaged in each lesson. Robbie had
also covered all of the content to be learnt, and pupils had been really enthusiastic
during class discussions and activities.

<strong>
  What could have misled Robbie about how well his pupils were learning? What
  could he do to identify these issues sooner and adapt his teaching to improve
  pupils’ learning?
</strong>
$CTA

In every lesson, teachers are gathering information about what their pupils know and can do and where misunderstandings or misconceptions lie. Teachers do this through the different forms of assessment that they use in the classroom. This diagnostic process is a vital part of formative assessment, in which teachers introduce, for example, effective classroom discussions that elicit evidence of learning.

Making a fair assessment of where pupils are in their learning is often complex, as teachers have to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as pupils appearing busy. Rob Coe has summarised some of the classroom behaviours and practices that may interfere with accurate assessments of pupils’ learning, which he terms Poor Proxies for Learning. These are activities which are easily observed but don’t necessarily signify learning (bear in mind that they are often not ‘negative’: they may contribute to a positive environment in which desired learning is more likely to occur, but they are not in themselves indicators of learning).

1. students are busy: lots of work is done (especially written work)
2. students are engaged, interested, motivated
3. students are getting attention: feedback, explanations
4. classroom is ordered, calm, under control
5. curriculum has been ‘covered’ (i.e. presented to students in some form)
6. (at least some) students have supplied correct answers (whether or not they really understood them or could reproduce them independently)

$I
Robbie was misled by his students completing lots of work and appearing engaged and enthusiastic. The challenge here is that these factors, although often supportive of learning, can also be observed where learning is not taking place – think, for example, about pupils who work hard to copy from a textbook or who write (or discuss) a lot without really engaging in ‘hard thinking’. Pupils may sit quietly and be highly engaged in watching an enjoyable video in a lesson, but the content of the video and how the teacher uses it will determine what and how much pupils learn.
$I

Sometimes, a pupil can produce a ‘correct’ response to a question or task without knowing that they have done so, or without knowing how they did it. In other words, their underlying understanding may not be secure. To test this underlying understanding, it is important that teachers regularly prompt their pupils to elaborate upon their answers. Elaboration means explaining and describing ideas in greater detail. It may also involve making connections between the ideas pupils are trying to learn and their own experiences, prior knowledge and understanding, and day-to-day life.

To prompt pupils to elaborate further, you could say:

- say it again in your own words’
- ‘show me the steps you took to achieve that answer’
- ‘prove to me that X is the wrong answer’
- ‘give me two reasons why you think this is correct’
- ‘explain it to someone who has a different answer’

You could also repeatedly ask ‘why?’ as a prompt to elaboration.

$I
Robbie noticed that his pupils were ‘enthusiastic’ during class discussions and made the inference that this meant they were learning. Instead of making this inaccurate inference, Robbie could have asked pupils to elaborate on the points they were contributing, using some of the prompts above. This would have given him more detailed data on pupils’ understanding, and he could then have adapted his teaching immediately to address any gaps in knowledge or pupil misconceptions.
$I

**Hinge questions** are a type of question that teachers use to learn more about pupils’ understanding. They are useful way for teachers to formatively assess their pupils and pinpoint gaps in their knowledge. These are used at pivotal ‘hinge’ points in a lesson or sequence of lessons – often at the end of a phase of learning, when a teacher wants to check pupils’ conceptual understanding to determine whether, and in which direction, they are ready to move on. The teacher asks a hinge question to all pupils and uses their responses (perhaps on mini-whiteboards or using traffic-light cards) to determine the extent to which pupils have understood key concepts and whether any misconceptions are still present. Hinge questions often use a multiple-choice format - the teacher can structure the multiple-choice options to reflect different levels of understanding, including common misunderstandings.

The pupils’ responses to the hinge question should provide the teacher with valuable evidence about what their pupils know, don't know and need to do next. The teacher should be able to collect (view) and interpret responses from all pupils in less than 30 seconds - e.g. by glancing at each mini-whiteboard or traffic-light card. Teachers will then make adjustments to their teaching to respond to any misconceptions.

$I

<h3>Developing a hinge question</h3>
This is Robbie’s first attempt at a hinge question:

<strong>Everything made of metal is an electrical conductor</strong>

A) True

B) False

After speaking with an experienced colleague, he rewrites his question so that each answer provides more useful information about pupils’ understanding:

<strong>
  Put these objects into three groups based on if they do, do not or maybe
  conduct electricity
</strong>
<ol>
  <li>A metal ruler</li>
  <li>A plastic ruler</li>
  <li>A shiny ruler</li>
  <li>A ruler</li>
  <li>A wooden ruler</li>
  <li>A long ruler</li>
</ol>
The second question is a better question because the answers that students give
– both correct and incorrect – reveal something about their understanding to the
teacher.

For the first question, pupils have a 50% chance of simply guessing correctly. The ‘wrong’ answer also reveals limited information about why pupils are incorrect. The answers to the second question could identify specific misconceptions – such as believing that because most metals are shiny, other shiny objects will also conduct electricity.
$I

Writing hinge questions takes careful preparation. To help you write a successful hinge question, consider these key characteristics as outlined by Dylan Wiliam:

- it should not be easy to guess the correct answer
- alternative answers should represent common misconceptions
- more than one answer may be correct (AND, not OR)
- pupils should not be able to arrive at the correct answer using incorrect reasoning
- pupils should be able to respond to the question in no more than two minutes (ideally, less than a minute)

**Misconceptions** typically occur when a pupil incorrectly applies prior knowledge to a new context, perhaps due to weaknesses in prior knowledge or because new ideas are introduced too quickly. For example, they might mis-remember a spelling rule, they might confuse definitions of important concepts or they might mis-apply a mathematical procedure by consistently leaving out an important step. Misconceptions can also arise from mis-hearing or mis-reading.

Once ‘learned’, misconceptions can become embedded in a pupil’s thinking and assumed to be true. As a teacher’s subject knowledge deepens, they learn to anticipate where these misconceptions commonly arise in their subject or phase. You were introduced to the idea of misconceptions in Module 2.

To help you anticipate and overcome misconceptions, you should:

- discuss with experienced colleagues what the common misconceptions are for an area of study and the steps they take to help pupils master the important concepts in this area while avoiding common misconceptions
- use assessments at the beginning of new topics to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions
- structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions and by targeting areas that you know pupils typically find particularly tricky)
- prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that correct answers stem from secure understanding

$I

<h3>What did Robbie do next? Applying good assessment practice</h3>
After learning more about good assessment, Robbie realised that he had been focusing
too much on things that were not directly related to learning. During the next topic,
electricity, he made the following changes and was impressed with the improvements
in pupils’ learning.
<ul>
  <li>
    Before teaching the topic, Robbie made sure that he understood common
    misconceptions about electricity by speaking to colleagues and researching
    them online. He then analysed his class’ responses to five carefully written
    diagnostic questions and used this to inform his planning – he started with
    what his pupils knew, not what he hoped they knew.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before teaching each lesson, Robbie thought carefully about how he would
    efficiently check the understanding of all pupils – not just the pupils who
    were keen to volunteer answers. He built in frequent activities throughout
    the topic that generated whole-class responses, including quick quizzes,
    multiple-choice questions and pupils showing their working on
    mini-whiteboards. He was careful to avoid relying on ‘poor proxies for
    learning’, instead targeting his planned assessments at the evidence that
    would tell him how his pupils were achieving the lesson objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    During each lesson, Robbie used the formative assessment techniques he had
    prepared, including forensic follow-up questions, to make his teaching more
    responsive to his pupils’ developing understanding. Where this identified
    widespread misconceptions, he spent more time addressing these issues with
    the whole class. Where particular pupils were struggling, he provided more
    targeted support, including dynamically re-grouping his students (e.g.
    pairing pupils who were less secure in their learning with peers who could
    effectively support them).
  </li>
</ul>
After this topic, Robbie created the following checklist to help him design questions
to check pupils’ understanding in the future:
<ul>
  <li>
    what does it look like when pupils understand this concept accurately and
    completely?
  </li>
  <li>
    what common misconceptions or knowledge gaps do pupils experience in
    relation to this concept?
  </li>
  <li>
    what question will prompt pupils to show me their understanding/
    misconceptions/knowledge gaps relating to this concept?
  </li>
  <li>
    how can I capture each misconception or knowledge gap as an option in the
    list of possible answers?
  </li>
  <li>
    is it possible to reach the correct answer with a process of incorrect
    reasoning? (In which case, the question needs further work)
  </li>
  <li>
    what actions will I need to take to address each misconception or knowledge
    gap in my pupils, if these are evident in pupils’ responses?
  </li>
</ul>
By following his new approach, Robbie is now much more aware of how his pupils are
learning – and is less distracted by potentially misleading factors. This means he
is more able to adapt his teaching to his pupils’ needs and capabilities. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### 1. Reflection

Identify situations in your teaching where you find it especially hard to decide about how well pupils are learning. This difficulty might be related to particular pupils, classes and/or lesson content. Use Rob Coe’s Poor Proxies for Learning, from the Research and Practice Summary above, to reflect on how these ‘proxies’ might be contributing to the difficulties you have in assessing the learning of these pupils.

Now focus on two or three pupils whose learning you find it difficult to assess accurately. Ask yourself:

1. What gets in the way of forming a clear picture of their learning?
2. What forms of assessment might best clarify my understanding of what they know and can do?
3. How might I introduce particular forms of assessment to develop a clearer picture of their learning?

Draw on this week’s Research and Practice Summary to help you here.

#### 2. Independent planning

Drawing on your reflections (above) and this week’s Research and Practice Summary, develop a plan for how you might gather additional evidence of learning about each of these pupils. The plan may be different for each of the pupils (e.g. for a reluctant writer, it may involve more oral dialogue). You might find it helpful to consider both general strategies for each pupil and specific strategies that you will use in a particular lesson that you will be teaching soon.

Write your plan and any additional notes or questions in your Learning Log, if you are using one. Bring this to your next mentor meeting for further review.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Review the outcomes of your thinking about how to apply assessment practice in the classroom to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear. Add to your Learning Log any additional notes, actions and/or questions arising from this session.

Be ready to share these reflections and your independent planning on assessment with your mentor in your next meeting with them.

## Introduction

In this module so far, you have focused on how you gather information about your pupils’ learning. In this self-study session, you will focus on what you do with this information, extending your knowledge about giving high-quality feedback.

You will explore how assessment information can be used to inform your decision making and the feedback pupils receive, as well as how they can use this feedback to move forward in their learning. With practice, pupils will increasingly be able to monitor and self-regulate their own learning through self-assessment. You will learn that the key to effective feedback is that it provides specific guidance, either verbal or written, that is clear and accurate, and that pupils are given the opportunity to act on it.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Giving high-quality feedback</h3>
Helen and Aaron have been marking their Year 3 English books together and are really
pleased with how much their pupils have improved since September. They have been
discussing how to make the most of feedback and realise that they disagree about
some key ideas. Helen believes the following:
<ul>
  <li>the more feedback you give pupils, the better</li>
  <li>written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback</li>
</ul>
Aaron disagrees. He says that Helen has developed some common misconceptions about
feedback.

<strong>
  What do you think? Who do you agree with? In your judgement, what is most
  important about effective feedback?
</strong>
$CTA

**Feedback** is information given to the pupil or teacher about the pupil’s performance relative to the intended learning. It is a key component of high-quality teaching and can dramatically affect learning, both positively and negatively. When giving feedback to pupils, it is important to get the details right – details both of what feedback is given and how it is given.

Last week you learned about how to use approaches to assessment to gather useful information about your pupils’ understanding, including any misconceptions that they might hold. This data gathering is the first stage of high-quality assessment practice, as it provides feedback to the teacher. The impact on pupils’ learning depends on what is done next with this information:

- first, the teacher needs to process the information that they collect: ask yourself ‘what does this tell me about pupils’ current understanding?’ and ‘who needs to take what action now to move pupils’ learning on?’
- then, the teacher needs to take, or support pupils to take, the action identified. This might be adapting teaching so that it takes account of current pupil understanding (perhaps to address misconceptions or to build on sound existing understanding); it might also be to give feedback to pupils so that they can do something to improve their learning further

There are lots of ways to categorise approaches to giving high-quality feedback to pupils, including:

- **what the feedback is about** – it can be about the person (e.g. how much effort was put into the work), products of learning (e.g. a piece of written or practical work) or about the learning process itself (e.g. how the pupil approached a task)
- **who gives the feedback** – feedback can be provided by a teacher, peers, pupils themselves or using digital technology
- **how the feedback is given** – it can be written, verbal, non-verbal (e.g. a nod of reinforcement, a physical gesture that models a practical activity)
- **when the feedback is given** – feedback can be immediate or delayed
- **how public the feedback is** – in busy classrooms, even one-to-one feedback can sometimes be picked up by other pupils: the message in the feedback should determine how public the feedback should be

There is no one ‘best’ approach to giving feedback. When providing any feedback, it is necessary to match it to your pupils’ characteristics and learning needs and to the nature of what is being learned. A quick verbal correction during a class discussion or a brief one-to-one chat while a pupil completes an extended activity are sometimes as powerful as detailed written comments in a pupil’s workbook. Messages of praise may be given publicly, whereas more challenging feedback may best be given privately and with the opportunity for pupils to clarify understanding in detail.

Using the categories above may help you to think more critically about the options available to you, and the choices you make, as you plan and teach lessons.

$I
Helen’s belief that ‘written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback’ is clearly incorrect. We could re-write this as ‘sometimes, written feedback is more powerful than verbal feedback’. As so often in teaching, the choice the teacher makes in any given situation should draw on their understanding of critical features of the context to select a suitable approach for that situation.
$I

More feedback is not necessarily better. Research syntheses, such as the Education Endowment Foundation’s Teaching and Learning Toolkit, suggest that feedback is most effective when it is used sparingly, for a number of reasons.

Too much feedback, especially focusing on weaknesses, can be dispiriting.

Providing excessive feedback can also cause cognitive overload, reducing pupils’ ability to process the feedback successfully. Even if pupils can process a lot of feedback at once, excessive volume can be overwhelming and confusing, meaning that pupils struggle to separate out, and take on board, key messages. Therefore, when giving feedback, you should consider what to prioritise and what may more helpfully be left out. It may be helpful to consider, ‘what is the best next step in learning?’

$I
Helen’s belief that ‘the more feedback you give, the better’ is also incorrect. Teachers who give too much feedback in one go may actually reduce the benefit that pupils get from it.
$I

To ensure that your use of feedback contributes to pupils’ learning, you should:

- **be accurate** – effective feedback needs to be based on an accurate assessment of pupils’ learning
- **be clear** – consider how you can ensure pupils understand feedback received (verbal and non-verbal feedback in the moment is sometimes more powerful than written feedback after the event, for example, opportunities for clarification also help to ensure that pupils understand fully)
- **be specific about what pupils should do** – focus on specific actions for the pupil (e.g. rather than saying ‘you need more detail here’, say ‘add a paragraph explaining how you reached this conclusion’ and provide pupils with suitable prompts to support them in doing this)
- **encourage further effort** – recognise effort as well as attainment in the feedback you give (e.g. ‘I can see that you’ve worked hard to make this progress in your work. Keep going; you can do this’)
- **develop self-regulation** – provide feedback on the process as well as the products of learning (e.g. ‘the plan that you wrote at the beginning really helped you to structure your writing clearly into strong paragraphs’). Self-regulation is also developed by teaching your pupils how to peer- and self-assess
- **provide opportunities to act on feedback** – this requires allocating lesson time or incorporating it into home learning
- **know your pupils** – tailor your language, feedback and tone to the characteristics of your specific pupils, while maintaining and demonstrating high expectations of all

<h3>Improving feedback</h3>
Aaron and Helen shared some examples of feedback that they’d written for pupils recently
on some English homework. <strong>
  Which do you think better exemplifies the characteristics of high-quality
  feedback?
</strong>

Helen had written:

<blockquote>
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">
    I like your story. It was exciting, and you used some good words. It would
    be better if you used more adjectives.
  </span>
</blockquote>
Aaron had written:
<blockquote>
  <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">
    Well done for working so carefully on this story. The way you used
    adjectives like ‘exciting’ and ‘dramatic’ helped to add tension, as we
    discussed in class. To improve this work further, you could use paragraphs
    to organise your writing so that the reader can follow the story more
    easily. You can do this during ‘review time’ on Thursday.{" "}
  </span>
</blockquote>
Helen’s feedback is too vague to be helpful and could further confuse her pupil.
They will not be clear from this feedback what ‘good’ words are, for example.

Aaron’s feedback is of higher quality as he is more specific than Helen, both in describing what is good about the work (with specific examples from the text) and how and when it can be further improved. This means the pupil should be better able to self-assess and improve their writing in the future.

However, Aaron’s comment is also quite long and detailed, which could make it harder for his pupil to act on the feedback. It also assumes that the pupil knows how to use paragraphs appropriately. Aaron could restructure his comment to make it more likely that the pupil will get the most from it:

<blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">WWW: Exciting adjectives!</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">
  EBI: New time or place = NP.
</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Task: Rewrite highlighted section in three paragraphs.</span></blockquote>
It might be helpful for Aaron to provide specific examples of exciting adjectives, but if he judges that the pupil clearly understands how to use them effectively, this might be unnecessary.

In week 1 of Module 4, you looked at formative and summative assessment. As part of formative assessment, peer-assessment and self-assessment can be valuable tools that enable pupils to monitor and improve their own progress against agreed success criteria. However, pupils first need to be trained in how to do this well, and the approaches work best alongside teacher assessment rather than as alternatives. Assessment can add significantly to a teacher’s workload, so it is important to become familiar with your school’s expectations and to learn from colleagues.

**Peer-assessment** can positively affect achievement and improve self-regulation. When pupils assess each other’s work and give feedback, this is peer-assessment. Peer-assessment offers multiple benefits when structured and scaffolded appropriately, including:

- helping pupils focus on the learning process, not simply the outcomes (which often happens with teacher assessment)
- it can be very timely, compared to pupils waiting for written feedback from the teacher
- pupils learn how to apply their critical process to their own work
- it can reduce the teacher’s workload when done well

Peer relationships may influence the effectiveness of peer-assessment. Teachers should be careful to ensure their pupils understand the success criteria for a task before expecting them to use the criteria to assess their peers.

**Self-assessment** is when pupils work with their teachers to agree a set of success criteria against which they can assess their current performance. It is most useful when deployed formatively (while a task is ongoing). Self-assessment will be allied with a set of ‘targets-for-self’, steps the pupil sets themselves to improve upon their work. Self-assessment has similar benefits as peer-assessment and is a key element in formative assessment. It is good way of teaching pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.

$I

<h3>Supporting pupils in monitoring and regulating their own learning</h3>
Helen is pleased with the quality of her class’ writing so far. Now she wants them
to do more to monitor and regulate their own learning. Specifically, she would like
her pupils to edit their own writing for common errors, including basic punctuation.

Helen decides that she can use peer-assessment to support this, especially as pupils are often reluctant to revise and edit their own work. Helen knows that effective peer-assessment takes careful planning so begins by modelling the process of self-editing for her class. She uses a visualiser and thinks aloud to share her thought processes as she assesses a short piece of writing that she created as a model. By doing this, Helen is further clarifying what good writing looks like (sharing success criteria) and supporting pupils to better understand how they can edit work themselves.

Next, Helen provides structured opportunities for pupils to peer-assess each other’s work. As part of this, she helps her pupils to better understand how to give effective feedback, highlighting how to make this specific and helpful. She gives pupils a framework for feeding back on ‘two stars and a wish’, using sentence stems such as ‘a strength of your work is…’ and ‘one way to improve this is…’. Her pupils are now more able to accurately review each other’s work and provide appropriate feedback. As they practise peer-assessment, they become more confident and skilled in assessing the quality of writing. Finally, Helen supports her pupils in applying this new competence to their own writing.
$I

To help you to improve the quality of peer- and self-assessment, you should:

- share clear success criteria and revisit these before (and even during) the activity - ensure that pupils understand these criteria by, for example, asking them to express the criteria in their own words
- scaffold activities by sharing models of good work (e.g. with a visualiser or interactive whiteboard) and identifying how their key features meet the success criteria
- explain why you are teaching pupils to self-assess: this helps pupils focus on the processes behind their learning and not simply the outcomes (which can be the case when they are assessed by their teacher); self-assessment enhances metacognitive thinking
- think carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer-assessment (e.g. by asking pupils to highlight a limited number of improvements to their partner’s work and to give clear examples of how to act on each improvement)
- carefully match your pupils during peer-assessment to reduce tensions that can arise when pupils provide feedback to each other
- explain to your pupils that there are benefits to giving feedback as well as receiving it - it can help the assessor to develop a better understanding of the most effective approaches to take to complete a task well
- invite your pupils to feed back to each other on how it felt to be peer assessed (this can build mutual trust and cooperation)

<h3>
  Combining feedback approaches as part of a learning cycle in GCSE business
</h3>
Alessia has a clear structure to the feedback that she provides on substantial pieces
of pupils’ work. She makes sure that her feedback covers the following, using the
acronym SIT.

Strengths: these are elements of the work that are good. Alessia highlights strengths throughout the text using yellow highlighter, then writes a summary at the end which helps pupils to understand why they are strengths. For example, ‘This is a strong evaluation because you are using key concepts (elasticity and demand) to justify why the business should take a particular action in this situation (reduce costs rather than raise prices).’

Improvements: Alessia highlights one part of the text in green and writes guidance at the end of the work for pupils which tells them how and why this section needs improving. Pupils are expected to re-work this part of the text during dedicated classroom time. For example, ‘Improve your analysis in this paragraph by explaining the steps in your reasoning that link raising prices to falling overall revenue. Use connectives such as ‘this should lead to’ and ‘as a consequence’ to build your chain of reasoning.’ Alessia keeps the improvements focused and manageable so she doesn’t overwhelm pupils.

Targets: Alessia identifies a target that each pupil should address in future work. For example, 'Extend lines of reasoning so that you always develop your arguments fully. Aim for at least 3 steps in each chain of analysis.’

When pupils start their next substantial piece of work, Alessia asks them to write their previous target at the top of their work. When they have finished the task, pupils write a comment next to the target to self-assess the extent to which they have met it. They also circle the part of their work where they feel they have best demonstrated this target.

This approach builds clarity into Alessia’s feedback so that pupils understand how to improve. It combines short-cycle feedback (on the immediate task, which is addressed in the following lesson) and medium-cycle feedback (which looks forward to the next piece of work). Having pupils comment on how they have met their target also helps Alessia to judge the extent to which each pupil has understood her feedback and develops pupils’ self-regulation and ability to self-assess.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 5 mins

#### Self-assessment

Now use the ideas in the research and practice summary to reflect in greater depth on your own feedback practice in relation to how you give feedback.

You might ask yourself:

- how accurate and clear is my feedback typically?
- to what extent does my feedback encourage further effort from pupils?
- is my feedback specific enough for pupils to improve?
- what opportunities do I generally give pupils to act on feedback?
- how does my feedback support pupils to increasingly monitor and regulate their own learning?

### Theory to Practice: 25 mins

You have a range of activities to engage with this week. Choose one or two of these activities that are most suited to your teaching context and learning needs.

#### 1. Analyse artefacts / reflect

Collect a few samples of written feedback that you have given recently. If you do not give written feedback often in your phase/specialism, briefly note the details of some verbal feedback that you have given recently. Review these samples of your own feedback on pupils’ work and note where they reflect characteristics of high-quality feedback.

1. Connect these characteristics to the Research and Practice Summary for this session and to the guide questions in the previous activity. Where can you see opportunities to further improve your feedback?
2. Having analysed some physical examples of your own feedback, consider how accurate you were in your reflections on feedback practice in the Review activity. Do you want to modify your self-assessment now that you have looked as samples of your feedback? What does this tell you about reflecting on and self-assessing your own practice, if anything?

#### 2. Discuss with pupils

If possible, arrange to **talk to a few pupils** in your school about their views on feedback. They don’t have to be pupils that you teach.

You might explore:

- how they understand the purpose of feedback
- whether they prefer verbal or written feedback and why
- what kind of action they typically take in response to feedback received
- what they think the relationship is between receiving feedback and their learning

#### 3. Discuss with a colleague

Talk to a colleague about realistic expectations for how independent and self-regulating pupils should be when they enter/leave each age range/phase/year in your setting. Reflect on your own expectations to date of pupils and how you might adjust these in light of your conversation, if at all.

Make notes in your Learning Log, if you are using one, about what you have learned from the previous activities. Note how you will draw on this learning to further improve the impact of your own practice in relation to giving verbal and written feedback.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

While teaching during the coming week, make a point of connecting learning from this session to your practice by:

- reflecting on the sort of feedback you give to your pupils and how this relates to the characteristics of high-quality feedback that you have learned about
- focusing on how you create opportunities for pupils to act on your feedback
- noticing specifically the impact this seems to have on their learning

Write a reminder to yourself to capture key learning from this activity in your Learning Log, if you are using one.

Be ready to share this and your other learning from this session with your mentor in your next meeting with them.

## Introduction

Last week, you looked at how to give high-quality feedback, taking account of a range of important variables. In this self-study session, you will extend your knowledge of planning effective and manageable marking and feedback. You will consider different approaches that you can draw on and use your learning to evaluate your current practice. You will focus on selecting approaches to assessment which are efficient and do not have a disproportionate impact on workload.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions of how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Reducing the opportunity cost of marking</h3>
Sara stretched her stiff neck and arms and put down her pen. Finally, she had finished
marking her pupils’ books. After hours of carefully annotating each piece of work,
she was fed up with highlighting common errors and writing the same comments again
and again. It was clear to Sara where she needed to focus her teaching in the next
lesson to address pupils’ learning needs, but she was just too tired to get started
on planning this now. The lesson would have to wait.

<strong>
  What could Sara have done differently in this situation? How could she make
  more efficient use of her time to assess pupils’ work, respond to this in her
  teaching and give pupils feedback?
</strong>

**Efficiency** can be thought of as ‘the reduction of waste’. The most common resource wasted in teaching is time, leading to an overall increase in teachers’ workloads and negatively impacting learning. Reducing wasted time is a key priority for teachers and school leaders.

It can be helpful to think of efficiency as the relationship between time taken and quality of outcome (i.e. ‘value for money’), because it doesn’t always follow that reducing time spent on an activity is a good thing per se. Teaching is intellectual labour, and some parts of a teacher’s work legitimately take time because they are hard to do well. For example, when planning to introduce a new, foundational concept, rushing the planning of a lesson may mean that pupils do not learn that concept securely, affecting many future lessons.

Schools and multi-academy trusts develop their own policies and practices around assessment, marking and feedback. They are encouraged to be mindful of the impact on teacher workload of assessment practices, especially around written marking on individual pieces of work, which can be onerous. You need to be aware of your school’s expectations of marking; you should also seek ways of minimising the potentially negative impacts of marking to excess. Time invested in marking and giving feedback must be used efficiently in order to make the most of the limited resource that you have. Self-assessment and peer-assessment both have pedagogical benefits and can help reduce marking workload for teachers, too.

To help you save time without significantly impacting the quality of outcomes, you could make marking manageable and effective by:

- recording data only when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes
- working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback (e.g. using whole class feedback or well supported peer- and self-assessment)
- using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons, where possible
- understanding that written marking is only one form of feedback (other forms include verbal feedback, peer- and self-assessment)
- reducing the opportunity cost of marking (e.g. by using abbreviations and codes in written feedback)

An important strategy for maximising efficiency when marking is to prioritise the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather than careless mistakes.

Mistakes are usually accidental – the pupil could identify and self-correct the mistake if prompted to. Errors can be more serious for learning because they arise from a lack of knowledge or misunderstanding. Although it can be tempting to point out to pupils the full range of mistakes across a task, this has two potentially negative consequences - the time it takes you to mark and the chance of overwhelming pupils with comments across their work. Aim to focus feedback on errors relating to the core concepts of the lesson. To reinforce the importance of good literacy across all subjects, you might correct the first three mistakes of general spelling, punctuation and grammar in a piece of work, then focus only on errors related to misunderstandings in the rest of the task. A general prompt to proof-read work carefully might be useful if careless mistakes are a common occurrence, but the focus of your feedback time can then be dedicated to securing and deepening pupils’ understanding of the concepts most central to their learning.

  Using codes to improve Sara’s approach to marking
</h3>
What could Sara do differently in the situation described above? Rather than spend
time repeatedly writing individual comments in pupils’ books, Sara could note the
common comments across her pupils’ work and capture these as a set of codes. In the
same way that ‘SPaG’ is often used as a code to indicate the need to address Spelling,
Punctuation or Grammar, other codes can be used to represent common subject- or phase-specific
comments. Marking each piece of work then becomes a case of noting the codes on each
pupil’s work, saving the teacher many minutes or hours. This time can then be used
to plan lesson activities that support pupils to understand and act on what the codes
in their work mean.

<strong>Using codes in your teaching:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      what comments do you often find yourself making on your pupils’ work?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      can you group these comments into categories that are helpful for making
      sense of the type of feedback being given? For example, presentation (e.g.
      underlining titles, writing clearly), subject-specific assessment criteria
      (e.g. English AO2 – effect on reader), conventions of the subject (e.g.
      describing scientific experiments, drawing graphs, safe use of equipment)
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      what codes would usefully capture these comments for your pupils in your
      context, relevant to your specialism?

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you do not use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 min

As explained in the Research and Practice Summary, ‘efficiency’ refers to the reduction of waste. You can think of efficiency as having two key aspects in relation to assessment: time taken and impact on learning. The more efficient an approach is, the more impactful the time taken is for pupil learning. In relation to marking and feedback, ‘waste’ could relate to each of the factors in the table below. The table includes ways to improve efficiency, in each case:

| Factor affecting overall efficiency\*\* \*\*                                                     | **Improving efficiency **                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| The amount of time teachers spend assessing pupils’ work and providing feedback.                 | Ask pupils to hand in workbooks open at the page to be marked to save time when marking a set of books.Reduce time spent assessing pupils’ work and writing feedback by, for example, using codes or abbreviations to reference common actions/comments on work or giving verbal instead of written feedback.Give feedback to pupils in small groups or as a class rather than individually.Engage pupils in peer-assessment and/or self-assessment, where appropriate. |

#### 1. Practical exercise

Identify two contrasting occasions on which you have given feedback to your pupils over the last half term. Write brief notes that describe each occasion. There are two examples shown below - your statements will differ according to the phase and specialism in which you are teaching:

$I
During a practical lesson in the workshop, I circulated around the room as pupils worked on cutting their wood pieces. I gave verbal feedback to each pupil as I observed their work. The main topics of feedback were health and safety, how well they were using tools, the quality of techniques used and reminding them of the objectives of the task.
$I

$I
The end of term assessment was a written test. I collected pupils’ books (already open at the page I needed to mark). I annotated each answer to highlight strengths and mistakes and then wrote a summative paragraph at the end of each test with the overall mark. I put a star by the question that pupils should focus on during improvement time. I gave back the books in the following lesson, and pupils had half an hour to read my feedback, re-draft the starred question and then do independent study to improve their knowledge of any topics that they didn’t get full marks on in the test.
$I

#### 2. Reflection / self-assessment

Now, evaluate these two occasions with a specific focus on how efficient the process was on each occasion. Use the details in the table above to help you think about the time taken and the impact on learning on each occasion.

As you reflect, you could ask yourself:

- ‘how and why did I decide which forms of feedback were most appropriate in different situations?’
- ‘what impact did these choices have on me in terms of the time taken to assess my pupils and give the feedback?’
- ‘what impact did these choices have on my pupils in terms of the time taken to engage with, and act on, the feedback?’
- ‘what impact did these choices have on the quality of learning for my pupils?’

Based on this activity, identify two key strengths in your approach to efficient assessment. Identify two actions that you will take going forward to make your approach to assessment even more efficient. Note these in your Learning Log, if you are using one.

#### 3. Discuss with a colleague

Now that you have thought about efficiency in your own assessment practice, have a short discussion with a colleague about the strategies they use to make their assessment practice as efficient as possible.

Add to the notes in your Learning Log, if you are using one, any ideas that you gain from this discussion.

To help structure this discussion, you could ask:

- ‘what strategies do you use to minimise the burden of assessment in your teaching?’
- ‘what do you see as the strengths and challenges of these approaches?’

If you are not able to speak to a colleague with the required expertise, you can refer to the video resource that accompanies this session.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Be ready to share your reflections from this session and any notes that you have made in your Learning Log with your mentor in your next meeting with them. You will work with your mentor to continue to explore efficient approaches to assessment.

## Introduction

In the ECT training session at the beginning of this module, you considered some important aspects of what it means to be (a) professional and approaches to managing your professional development over time. This has been expanded through subsequent sessions in the module. In this week’s self-directed study session, you have the opportunity to revisit your thinking around professional development and to explore opportunities to continue to develop yourself over time.

## Research and Practice Summary

This reading will help you understand some of the theory behind this week’s topic. We will start by introducing some of the key concepts (these are in bold). You will also see some suggestions on how to put these concepts into practice. **When using these concepts in your own practice, you will need to take account of your pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Improving Harry’s questioning</h3>
Harry is a very effective teacher who works hard to keep improving. His pupils are
doing well and enjoy their English lessons, and Harry’s colleagues recognise the
excellent work he is doing.

Following a series of peer observations with colleagues, Harry has decided that he wants to further develop his use of questioning.

<strong>
  What should Harry think about when planning relevant professional development?
</strong>
$CTA

During the early years of your career, you can make rapid progress in your development as a teacher through effective professional development. Not all professional development is equally powerful, though – the types of professional development and how you engage with it make all the difference.

Overall, there is limited evidence that directly tests different forms of professional development. However, there are a number of important features that researchers think are associated with effective professional development.

Key features of effective professional development include:

- **focus** – having a specific focus on something that is likely to improve pupil outcomes is a central feature of effective professional development. If professional development is too broad or focuses on things unlikely to benefit pupils, then it is unlikely to be effective at improving teaching overall
- **collaboration and expert challenge** – working with colleagues, particularly with relevant expertise, can make professional development more motivating. Colleagues can also provide support and challenge to help you develop, both informally and through a more formalised coaching relationship
- **sustained** – one-off professional development tends not to be very effective. Most changes to how you teach require sustained focus and effort. This is especially important for changing habits, such as how you get a class to pay attention
- **practice** – there is often a big gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’. Practice, sustained over time, can help you to embed habits and routines so that you can move from simply knowing about an aspect of effective teaching to using it regularly and purposefully.

As you have already learnt, reflection is an important part of developing as a professional. It can help you to identify progress made, recognise strengths and weaknesses, and identify next steps in your continued improvement.

However, it is important to remember that your judgement alone can be fallible, but you can complement your reflections with information from other sources. Combining these sources of information with your professional judgement gives you the best chance of developing as a teacher.

Other sources of information to guide your professional development:

- **research evidence** – using high-quality research evidence can guide you towards ‘best bets’ which are most likely to improve learning. This includes focusing your effort where it is most likely to matter, working out how to use your energy most effectively and avoiding fads that are not supported by evidence. When using evidence, it is crucial to remember two guiding questions: ‘is this evidence credible?’ and ‘is this evidence applicable to my own context?’
- **feedback from colleagues** – colleagues can bring a fresh perspective and may have specialist knowledge that can help you to improve. Seeking their constructive challenge, feedback and critique can help you to improve
- **pupil data and views** – ultimately, effective teacher professional development is about improving pupil outcomes. Therefore, it is important to use information about pupils, including their views, to inform your reflections. However, it is important to be mindful of the limitations of the data you are using and to exercise professional judgement in interpreting this data, as you would in all cases

<h3>Harry’s professional development</h3>
Harry knows that effective questioning can fulfil many different purposes, including
checking pupils’ prior knowledge. Therefore, questioning is a powerful way of supporting
pupils’ learning. Harry also knows about some of the things that research evidence
suggests can improve questioning, including:
<ul>
  <li>
    prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to ensure that correct answers
    stem from a secure understanding
  </li>
  <li>allowing sufficient thinking time after posing questions</li>
  <li>
    targeting a range of pupils to answer questions, rather than relying on
    volunteers to respond to provide a better overview of the understanding of
    all pupils in a group
  </li>
</ul>
Despite knowing these things, Harry routinely finds that he does not do them consistently,
instead reverting to old habits in the midst of classroom activity – this is the
gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’. These ‘old habits’ are well-embedded, and it will
require sustained effort to improve Harry’s approaches to questioning. To achieve
this, Harry decides to focus on the three areas identified and to make this a sustained
focus of his professional development. He actively plans lots of opportunities to
practise, sometimes scripting out key questions or interactions in advance of a lesson.
He also works with colleagues who provide advice about refining his questioning techniques,
and he arranges to have some coaching and feedback over a 6-week period from an expert
colleague. Harry’s coach provides ongoing support and challenge around his goal of
improving his questioning. Harry finds that this sustained focus on the 3 areas he’s
identified over a period of time really helps him to embed improved approaches to
questioning in his practice. $I

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 10 mins

Read the research and practice summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan and Theory to Practice: 30 mins

#### Reflection

Now repeat the activity in step 1 but with reference to other professional development activities that you have engaged with this year. These could include:

- in-school activities such as weekly teaching and learning updates
- external activities supported by your school, such as attendance at exam board training
- activities you have undertaken in your own time, such as reading relevant literature or attending a weekend conference

#### Practical exercise

Drawing on the research and practice summary for this week, and on your own knowledge and experience of teacher professional development, sketch out a ‘menu’ of professional development opportunities that you think are relevant and useful to teachers in your phase and specialism. You will work further on this exercise in your next mentor meeting.

As you draft your notes, consider:

- any costs associated with the opportunity (include time and monetary costs)
- how the opportunity meets the criteria for effective professional development
- how relevant the opportunity is for teachers in your phase and specialism
- how easily accessible the opportunity is
- why you think this is good professional development – how is it expected to improve your professional practice?

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your draft ‘menu’ of professional development opportunities to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this activity with your mentor.

## Introduction

At the start of term, you reviewed your development needs in relation to Standards 1 & 7 with your mentor, using the Module 6 audit (this was based on the audit from Module 1 that you completed last year). Last week, at the annual conference, you examined the principles of practitioner inquiry, learning how to form an exploratory question, which examines the impact upon pupils of your normal practice (ECF Standard 8a); and how to collect evidence about your practice (ECF Standard 8d). By the end of the conference you should, with your mentor, have agreed what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence about what impact your normal practice has on your pupils now.

This week, in advance of your mentor meeting, you should use your self-study time to define what your normal practice is like in this area and collect evidence of the impact of your practice upon your pupils.

$I

<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>
Schools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries, first of all,
make use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’
work and the ECT’s assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils
and what the ECT has heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection,
in the main, we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they
are saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you
do this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a
few pupils for five minutes at the start of break time, or you might share lunch
with a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class.
$I

## Case Studies

These case studies explore how two teachers developed their own teaching and conducted their own practitioner inquiries into setting high expectations and managing behaviour effectively. Both are interesting but you should focus on the one most closely related to the exploratory question you are working on. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice and how they used the research embedded in the ECF to decide how to introduce an alteration to the way they taught.

**When studying these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Setting high expectations</h3>
Sam, a Year 5 teacher, believes that he is good at forming positive relationships
with his class. He has a proactive approach to behaviour management, and he encourages
his pupils to work hard through the use of praise and reward points. As a result,
Sam doesn’t have many problems with behaviour, and his pupils say they enjoy his
lessons. However, progress data indicate that a number of pupils in Sam’s class (including
lower and higher prior attaining pupils) are not achieving age-related expectations
in maths. To investigate this further, Sam decided to develop his teaching in this
area and to undertake a practitioner inquiry.

Following a discussion with his Head of Year (who advised him on which pupils to concentrate on), he decided to undertake some pupil voice work, to see what his pupils thought about his normal practice and how far they agreed that the expectations he had of them were challenging.

Sam wrote an initial, exploratory question:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  What do Year 5 pupils say, think and feel about the work they are set in
  maths?
</p>
To answer this question, Sam decided to give his class a short survey, which consisted
of hands-up/ hands-down responses to 5 questions; this took just 2 minutes at the
end of a lesson. He then interviewed a small, representative sample of pupils in
3 focus groups of 3. He did this during 5 minutes of morning break, on three mornings
of one week. The data Sam collected suggested the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    pupils like receiving praise and encouragement when they feel they deserve
    it
  </li>
  <li>
    sometimes, pupils feel the work is too easy, or that they have ‘done it
    before’
  </li>
  <li>sometimes pupils don’t understand the expectations Sam has of them</li>
  <li>
    sometimes, pupils don’t understand how they are supposed to respond to the
    feedback Sam gives them about how to push their learning on to the next
    level
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  What alteration to his teaching might Sam make to improve the levels of
  challenge, support and feedback he provides for pupils?
</strong>
$CTA

### A multifaceted approach to setting high expectations

Reflecting on the data he had collected, Sam looked again at the research on high expectations in the Early Career Framework – particularly 1a to 1d – to help him plan an intervention based around setting high expectations. He realised that setting high expectations is a complex process, with many moving parts. Sam therefore decided to create a multifaceted ‘high expectations plan’, comprising the following elements:

- set pupils a short weekly quiz to determine their current level of knowledge and understanding; he made sure that this was non-threatening so that the pupils were supported by a positive environment and recognised that they could learn from their mistakes (1c)
- write explicit, descriptive success criteria for each maths lesson and refer to these success criteria intentionally and consistently in lessons – this was so the pupils would understand the challenge he was setting them and how to achieve it (1b)
- he wanted to model for them how pupils like them might respond to a classroom environment where the expectations were high – he invented a fictional pupil, ‘risk-taking Sam’, but told them that Sam was based on himself; he did this to a) model what it looks like to take risks and push yourself out of your comfort zone; b) model common mistakes and misconceptions made by pupils in the class; c) help pupils anticipate common misconceptions and identify solutions before they arise; and d) create an environment where risk-taking and mistake-making are embraced as a part of the learning process – he hoped in this way to influence the attitudes of his pupils (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1a)
- contact the parents and carers of three pupils each week to celebrate success where pupils have reached or exceeded expectations in maths (1d)

<h3>Managing behaviour effectively</h3>
Meera knows that behaviour in her Year 8 classes needs to improve. Each week, she
spends several hours setting, running and chasing up detentions. Often, these detentions
involve the same pupils each week. Because she has to spend time in lessons dealing
with low-level disruption, this has a detrimental impact on Meera’s ability to teach
effectively, and on the progress of pupils in her classes. To improve her practice
with regard to managing behaviour effectively, Meera decided to undertake a practitioner
inquiry. Knowing that many of her colleagues have excellent behaviour-management
skills, Meera wrote the following, exploratory question:

How do high-performing teachers normally establish a positive climate for learning at School X?

Meera’s school encourages teachers to observe each other informally, and her inquiry coincided with an ‘observe-to-learn fortnight’, which made it easy for her to arrange to observe three colleagues, teaching similar classes to her own—one from within her own department and two from other departments. She followed their advice to come in just for the first 10 minutes of their lessons when they were reinforcing routines. Meera was pleasantly surprised and encouraged to see the pupils she found challenging working diligently in other lessons. She noticed that the teachers had little poor behaviour to react to: they had already done the hard work when they had set up their routines. The observations helped her to understand that teachers, by being good role models themselves, can affect the motivation and behaviour of their pupils. (1.1, 1.2)

When Meera spoke to the teachers together one lunchtime, they gave her their top tips. She also read again her Learning Log notes for Module 1, where she had recorded her insights into demonstrating high expectations of behaviour. From these chats, and from her reading, Meera collated the following insights:

<ul>
  <li>
    that it’s best, where possible, to establish routines at the beginning of
    the year, but it is more important to keep practising them – reinforcing
    positives; for example, by highlighting the behaviours she wants to see more
    of (7i)
  </li>
  <li>
    pupils with SEND especially – but all pupils really – respond best when they
    know clearly what the teacher’s expectations are. Meera decided she would
    always praise effort, always praise when a pupil reacted well to making a
    mistake, always correct a pupil if they spoke out of turn (7.2, 1h)
  </li>
  <li>
    it is useful to use rewards and sanctions consistently and predictably (1g);
    however, this should not be the sole method of behaviour management as it is
    ‘after the fact’
  </li>
  <li>
    it is important to have high expectations with regard to behaviour and to
    stick to them rigorously (1f)
  </li>
  <li>
    it is important to give pupils manageable, specific and sequential
    instructions – short routines – to make expectations really clear and to
    minimise misbehaviour caused by confusion (7c)
  </li>
  <li>
    it is a good idea to use consistent language and non-verbal signals for
    common classroom directions (7e)
  </li>
  <li>
    when dealing with low-level disruption, it is important to use minimally
    invasive interventions in the first instance, to avoid escalating conflict
    and to give pupils the opportunity to respond (7f)
  </li>
</ul>
Meera also analysed the behaviour data relating to her classes and noticed a pattern
that most of the pupils she regularly sets detentions for are boys who speak English
as an Additional Language (EAL) in Year 8.

<strong>
  What alterations to her practice might Meera begin to try to improve the
  behaviour of pupils in her lessons?
</strong>
$CTA

### A multifaceted approach to managing behaviour effectively

After she had pulled together all her evidence, Meera identified a number of strategies she wanted to try in order to improve behaviour in her Year 8 lessons, centred around memorable behaviour routines:

- Create a set of short, positively worded, three-step routines to make clear her expectations with regard to pupils’ behaviour in each part of a lesson (7h) – for example:

  - entering the room – enter in silence, planner on desk, start the ‘do now’ task
  - when the teacher is talking – hands empty, perfect silence, eyes on me
  - during class discussions – take turns, give reasons, track the speaker
  - during independent work – collect resources, check understanding, work in silence
  - at the end of the lesson – chair under desk, stand behind chair, wait to be dismissed

- create visual reminders of the above and non-verbal signals to help pupils understand behaviour expectations for each part of a lesson (7e)

- deliberately practise the routines until the pupils can do them without thinking (7i), and mention the routines regularly using clear, consistent language and non-verbal signals – for example, her hand up means she is waiting for quiet (7j)

- make sure all pupils understand her expectations with regard to behaviour (as well as tasks) in each part of a lesson, especially those pupils who receive detentions most frequently – she would nominate a pupil to repeat back an instruction if she suspected the class were confused (7c)

- reinforce these routines and expectations through the consistent and predictable use of rewards and sanctions (e.g., not allowing pupils to speak while the teacher is speaking) (7a)

- because she often found herself at a loss for what to say in the heat of the moment, she would use scripted responses when responding to incidents of low-level disruption, to avoid escalation and to give pupils time to respond – for example, she made a habit of always referring off-task pupils back to the learning intentions of the lesson (7f)

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 5 mins

Read the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:

1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation
2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you
3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry

### Plan: 5 mins

#### Action planning

At the conference, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.

Plan out how you are going to do that; for example:

- If you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, from whom will you collect it, and when will you do it? Will you be able to collect it during a lesson?
- If you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be, and when will they observe you? Are there more time-efficient ways of doing this – for example, if they could observe you for 10 minutes, which 10 minutes should they watch?

Remember, this is a very short inquiry, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect are valid for your inquiry (i.e. that they offer evidence to help you answer your question).

### Theory to Practice: 40 mins

How you collect your evidence will depend upon the area of practice you are developing. However, it is likely to include the following:

#### 1. Analyse artefact and reflection

Your question may have been something like:

- ‘What do my pupil data say about the progress of high prior attaining girls?’
- ‘Which parents are more likely to engage in their child’s learning?’
- ‘In what conditions do my pupils behave well so that they can learn productively?’

Data for all of this will be near to hand; you won’t need to look hard to find these data.

Schools retain data on all sorts of aspects pertaining to the behaviour of pupils and how they respond to the culture of expectations around them. Your data management system will store much of this; administrative staff may help you access data on attendance and punctuality; other colleagues, including pastoral staff and specialists such as the SENCO, can tell you about previous behaviour patterns, levels of parental engagement and support the pupils have received in the past.

When collecting these sorts of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |
| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – are they still true now? For example, is a pupil’s past behaviour record reliable evidence of their behaviour patterns now?                                                                                           |
| Manageability | For a short inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Look first for the naturally occurring data: those which are available to you as a normal part of your job.                                                                       |

Meera looked at the behaviour data on the school’s system relating to all her classes but noticed that most problems were occurring in her Year 8; hence, she decided to look further only at those data. By doing so, she noticed a pattern that most of the pupils she regularly set detentions for were boys who speak English as an Additional Language (EAL).

#### 2. Discuss with pupils

Your question may have been something like:

- ‘What do my pupils say about the expectations I have of them about the quality of their work?’
- ‘When are my pupils more likely to respond positively when faced with challenging problems?’
- ‘In what conditions do my pupils behave well so that they can learn productively?’

When collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                        |
| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. When can you collect pupil voice data? Can you do it in your lesson by a show of hands, or by speaking to a small group for 3 minutes while their classmates get on with independent learning? Do you need 5 minutes of a break time? Don't use up more of your – or their – time than is strictly necessary. |

Sam decided to give his class a short, hand-up survey. Because he wanted to be sure he understood those findings and could rely on them, he then interviewed a small, representative sample of pupils in focus groups over three morning breaks.

#### 3. Self-assessment

In preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about your normal practice. This does not have to be definitive: it just describes what you think the evidence is saying about your practice now.

e.g.,

Sam, in Case Study A, said:

> ‘The feedback from my pupil survey seems to indicate that my pupils like me, and they feel safe in my classroom. However, some of my pupils also feel that I let them get away with producing work of a lower standard than I should. One lower-attaining pupil said that I seemed to be satisfied if he just “made an attempt”. Other evidence – from the last pupil progress meeting – also showed that my higher-attaining pupils’ work is not yet at the same level as similar pupils in the other class. The pupil survey suggested that my higher-attaining pupils would like me to model for them with more clarity what a high-quality outcome might look like for them. Overall, I need to have higher expectations of my pupils and make those explicit for them.’

Meera, in Case Study B, said:

> ‘I am exhausted after every lesson with this class because I am struggling to manage their behaviour effectively. I had the impression that every pupil was misbehaving but, of course, that wasn’t true. Our data management system tracks the behaviour points and merits for all pupils. I realised that my difficulties were mainly in Year 8. I noticed that, for this class, 90% of the behaviour points I was logging was for boys, often boys with EAL. Also, other teachers were not logging so many behaviour points for the same boys. This seems to suggest that there are things I could do to more effectively manage their behaviour, which would help the whole class.’

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your next mentor meeting. Be ready to discuss this with your mentor. In that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.

| **2.8** Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall           |
| **2.9** Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn                                                     |
| **3.5** Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial                                             |

## Introduction

At the start of this half-term, you reviewed your development needs in relation to Standards 2 & 3 with your mentor, using the Module 7 audit (this was based on the audit from Module 2 that you completed last year.) You also constructed with them an exploratory inquiry question, which will help you focus your development across this module. Last week, in your ECT Training session, you looked again at the nature of school-based evidence and discussed issues of ‘sufficiency’ and ‘validity’.

Next week, you have another mentor meeting. To prepare for that, you should use your self-study time to define what your normal practice is like in your focus area and to collect evidence of the impact of your practice upon your pupils. It is helpful for any teacher to get into habits of monitoring your practice, reviewing its impact and implementing useful changes.

$I

<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>
Schools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make
use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’
work—and the ECT’s assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils—and
what the ECT has heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in
the main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are
saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do
this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few
pupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with
a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I

## Case Studies

These case studies explore how two teachers—improving their practice and without adding to their workload—conducted their own practitioner inquiries into promoting good progress and demonstrating good subject and curriculum knowledge. Both are interesting, but you should focus on the one most closely related to the development area you are working on and your exploratory question. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice, and how they decided to introduce an alteration to the way they taught.

**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Embedding retrieval, practice and challenge</h3>
Yemi is a chemistry specialist teaching a Year 10 class who are motivated and able
to work independently. She notices that some students are able to finish sets of
problems involving drawing the atomic structure of an element quickly and accurately,
whilst others need support and are often left behind. She also feels that they are
not able to then apply this knowledge in thinking about which elements are more reactive.
She talks to a colleague who she shares this class with, and they suspect that recall
of key points about atomic structure and the periodic table might be at play here.

They decide they need to develop their practice in this area so come up with an exploratory inquiry question together:

<blockquote>
  To what extent do we give pupils opportunities to recall key knowledge about
  atomic structure and the periodic table?
</blockquote>
The 2 teachers decide to work together to investigate this. In one lesson, they ask
pupils to try to answer a set of problems which ask them to draw the atomic structure
of a few elements and to then explain how reactive they are. They do not provide
any resources for this and explain to the pupils that they are setting a very challenging
task and that pupils should try and identify where they struggle if they can. In
the next lesson, the other teacher gives them a similar set of problems but makes
this ‘open book’, allowing them to draw on a textbook to help, but asking them to
note down what they have to look up.  From considering their exercise books and talking
to the pupils afterwards, they find that:
<ul>
  <li>
    pupils need to recall the basic facts of the structure of atomic shells
  </li>
  <li>
    pupils who answer questions quickly, already know ‘rules’ about which groups
    in the periodic table are more reactive
  </li>
  <li>
    pupils who complete questions are able to relate their knowledge of atomic
    structure to their knowledge about reactivity
  </li>
  <li>
    Conclusion: all pupils need to know the ‘rules’ about which groups in the
    periodic table are more reactive, before they can answer questions with a
    high degree of success, or apply this knowledge to other problems; they
    realise that this is probably always true about the importance of core
    knowledge (3.5)
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  What alteration to her teaching might Yemi make to improve her pupils’ recall
  of key concepts so they can apply their knowledge quickly and reliably to
  other situations?
</strong>
$CTA

### Yemi’s approach to embedding retrieval, practice and challenge

Yemi and her colleague look at the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 2, in particular those covering ECF 2h, 2i, 2j and 2k; they realise that they need to build in retrieval practice as well as increasing the challenge of the exercises over time, and they decide to plan three revision activities, which they will spread over the next three lessons (whilst still teaching other content)—in them, they will:

- repeat questions which ask pupils to recall the structure of atomic shells, and practise drawing structures (2i)
- as their recall becomes more secure, ask pupils to make predictions about reactivity based on which group and element is in the periodic table, and based on the atomic structure (2j)
- increase the complexity of the task, by challenging the pupils to consider reactions that occur between different (ionic) elements (2k)

<h3>Supporting a class with reading comprehension</h3>
Kishan is a Year 3 teacher in an inner-city school, and is pleased with how his class
are developing fluency with reading. Having learned about this during his ITT year,
and in Module 2 of his ECF year 1, Kishan has promoted reading for pleasure by reading
aloud with his class and using a range of different texts and genres including fairy
tales, poetry, fiction and some non-fiction. However, he notices that they sometimes
struggle to comprehend and discuss the feelings and thoughts that characters might
have and to draw on the texts to understand the motives involved. This becomes clear
in his whole-class questioning and pupil written work around comprehension. Following
a discussion with another Year 3 teacher, Kishan decides to consider the details
of which texts they struggle with and which they find easy to comprehend or think
critically about.

He drafts an exploratory inquiry question:

<blockquote>
  Under what conditions are pupils more likely to be able to comprehend the
  motivations of characters in a range of texts?
</blockquote>
To answer this question, Kishan and his colleague decide to review a sample of pupil
work on reading comprehension and see if there was any relation to the types of texts
being read. What they find suggests that:
<ul>
  <li>
    when the pupils know the context well, they comprehend motivations more
    easily, and they can make critical connections (3.6); the pupils are able to
    explain the actions of characters more readily when they know the story and
    context well, e.g., when it is about a child rather than a magical creature
    in a fairy tale—they also found a text more difficult when it was set around
    a farm.
  </li>
  <li>
    skills that pupils demonstrate in one area do not necessarily transfer to
    another (3.8); pupils are sometimes able to make claims about the intentions
    and feelings of characters in fiction, including in fairy tales, but seem to
    really struggle in poetry
  </li>
  <li>
    pupils can connect details more readily, and understand the relationships
    between them when they appear more closely together; in non-fiction, pupils
    are able to infer motivations if they are described in the same paragraph as
    a description of the character but struggle when reference to the character
    is a long way from the context which leads to the action—for example, a
    newspaper-style account of why an elderly lady is waiting by the letterbox
    is a long way from text saying that people receive a card from the queen
    when they are 100 years old
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  What alteration to his normal practice might Kishan make to support his class
  in reading comprehension?
</strong>
$CTA

### Building critical thinking and transfer skills

Reflecting on the evidence he had gathered so far, Kishan went back to the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 2, in particular relating to 3g, 3k, 3n and 3p. He found the useful reminder around how pupils need to be secure in their understanding before they can think critically or transfer their knowledge or skills from one domain to another. He thought it would be helpful if his pupils could experience models of how to question, make predictions or summarise to improve reading comprehension. He therefore decided to reorganise the next sequence of learning with the following principles in mind:

- using himself as a model first, thinking out loud as he was reading: asking questions—‘Why do I think Biff did that?’, making predictions—‘I think Biff is going to find the key’ and summarising — ‘So I think that the children all got home safely because they helped each other when they needed it’ (3p)
- make sure that pupils have a clear understanding of the context presented within the text, and support them in asking questions to do this (3k)
- present the same type of narrative first (e.g., fiction) until they are confident in comprehending motivations of characters before introducing other forms (e.g., poetry)
- as those new forms are introduced, be explicit about how the same skills of comprehension might still apply, despite the different form (3g)
- use succinct texts to start with, and consider using more involved or lengthy texts for those pupils who seem to have a good grasp early on (3n)

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 5 mins

1. read the case studies on this week’s topic or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating; as you read, reflect on:
2. how similar this scenario is to your own situation
3. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you
4. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry

### Plan: 5 mins

#### Action planning

In your mentor meeting at the start of this module, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.

Plan out how you are going to do that, e.g.,

- If you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, who will you collect it from and when will you do it without adding to your workload?
- If you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be and when will they observe you?
- If you are going to collaborate with a colleague, like Yemi and Kishan, who will that be and how will you manage your time?

Remember, as with Module 6, this is a very short inquiry, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect is valid for your inquiry (i.e. that it offers evidence to help you answer your question).

### Theory to Practice: 40 mins

How you collect your evidence will depend upon the exploratory question you are asking and the sources of evidence you decided you needed. However, it is likely to include the following:

#### 1. Analysing artefacts and data

Your question may have been something like:

‘What does my recent marking and recording of assessment data say about the prior knowledge of middle prior attaining boys?’

‘What are the misconceptions that pupils typically have about the topic I am about to start teaching?’

‘How appropriate are the textbooks I have for the curriculum I want to teach and the stage my pupils are at?’

It is useful to remember that pupil work—whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written—is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question.

When collecting this sort of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |
| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past—is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s past behaviour record reliable evidence of their behaviour patterns now?                                                                                                |
| Manageability | For a short inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes—for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources—is a handy way to make sense of the data                                                             |

Kishan and his colleague reviewed samples of pupil work from both their classes on reading comprehension to see if the same problems arose in different types of text. This seemed like a reliable way of checking the problems their pupils had with comprehension and misconceptions.

#### 2. Discuss with pupils

Your question may have been something like:

‘What do my pupils say about how effective I am at breaking new material down into smaller steps?’

‘How comfortable are my pupils with sharing their ideas when their understanding is still insecure, and they still have points of confusion?’

‘How easily do my high prior attaining pupils find it to transfer their knowledge from one area so they can apply it in another?’

‘Do my boys like to read?’

When collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but… |
| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them.                                                                                                                                                         |

Yemi and her colleague got useful data when they asked their pupils to write their answers to questions and to note when they used supporting texts. They followed this up with three or four focused interviews to gain a more reliable understanding of their pupils’ problems in chemistry.

#### 3. Self-assessment

In preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying. This does not have to be definitive.

e.g.,

Yemi, in Case Study A, said:

> ‘My Year 10 pupils are really motivated, and they like working independently. Many of them can quickly and accurately solve problems, but others are left behind—which seems to get worse when I make the task more complex. When my colleague and I examined their books and spoke to a few pupils, we found that some lacked knowledge of basic science facts and rules, and so could not move on to more complex tasks. I realise now that I need to give them lots of opportunities to recall and practise the fundamentals. I need to think about when I give extra scaffolded support, and when I can withdraw it.’

Kishan, in Case Study B, said:

> ‘My pupils seem to be fluent readers, but I noticed that they have problems with reading comprehension. When with a colleague I analysed samples of their work, I found that they appeared to struggle to comprehend motivation when they were unfamiliar with the contexts; that when connected details appeared closer together in a text they seemed to comprehend more readily; and they didn’t easily transfer their comprehension skills in one genre to another. I have decided I need to help build my pupils’ skills with critical thinking and transfer. I suspect the best way of doing this will be to help them become really good at comprehending motivation in short fiction first, before moving to other genres. I also suppose that I could model good questioning, predicting and summarising to help with their comprehension.’

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.

In that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.

## Learning Intentions for this session

The focus of your inquiry for Module 8 is on an element of the Early Career Framework (ECF) from Standards 4, 5 or 6. You might have chosen a focus which combines different elements of these standards.

The teachers in the case studies remind you that you have learned that:

| **Case Study A**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4.9** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice                                                                           |
| **4.10** How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation                                                              |
| **5.5** Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils |

| **Case Study B**                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4.3** Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible                  |
| **4.4** Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases |

| **Case Study C**                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **6.5** High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve  |
| **6.7** Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload |

| **Case Study D**                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4.5** Explicitly teaching metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success                |
| **4.6** Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems |

## Introduction

At the start of this term, you reviewed your development needs in relation to Standards 4, 5 & 6 with your mentor, using the Module 8 audit (this was based on the audits from Module 3 and 4 that you completed last year.) You also constructed with them an exploratory inquiry question, which will be your focus for the first part of this module. Last week, in your ECT Training session, you looked at how to design different types of inquiry questions, about the advantages of collaboration on an inquiry and how to present your findings so that others can also learn from your inquiry.

Next week, you have another mentor meeting. To prepare for that you should use your self-study time now to define what your normal practice is like in your inquiry focus area, and to collect evidence of impact of your practice upon your pupils.

$I

<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>
Schools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make
use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’
work, and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils,
and what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in
the main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are
saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do
this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few
pupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with
a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I

## Case Studies

These case studies explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment. All are interesting but you should focus on the one or two that most closely relate to the exploratory question you are working on. The case studies set out the issue the teacher was interested in, how they gathered evidence about the impact upon pupils of their own normal practice, and how they decided to introduce an alteration to the way they taught. (Later in the module, you will return to these case studies to learn what they did next.)

**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>
Andy has several vulnerable children in his Year 1 class: very many suffer from low
self-confidence or poor self-regulation. At the start of the year, he organised his
table groups randomly, making only small changes when he sensed that two or more
pupils in a group were disengaging. He was unhappy with their apparent levels of
motivation and found that he was struggling to offer the more tailored support to
groups that he felt they needed. To explore how he might overcome these problems
by improving the effectiveness of his grouping strategy, Andy decided to undertake
a practitioner inquiry.

Andy first wanted to get to the bottom of what the impacts were of his current practice of random grouping, and why it appeared not to be working. He had a highly experienced teaching assistant (TA), so he began with this exploratory question:

<blockquote>
  What has the class TA noticed about the grouping of pupils and its effect on
  their attainment, behaviour and motivation?
</blockquote>
Since the start of the year, Andy and his TA have established the habit of taking
10 minutes for a cup of tea at the end of the day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
to talk about how the pupils have been progressing. He uses one of these informal
meetings to gather his TA’s thoughts on what effects his grouping strategy is having
on their pupils’ attainment, behaviour and motivation, and compares this with his
own reflections.

Their joint conclusions were that:

<ul>
  <li>
    some pupils were reluctant to work with others because they didn’t know them
    – this was causing low-level disruption to occur in the lesson
  </li>
  <li>
    some were worried about what the other pupils might think if they made a
    mistake with their learning – they were becoming averse to trying out their
    ideas
  </li>
</ul>
Neither the TA nor Andy was being effective in how they were targeting their support
for their pupils, neither for those who required greater scaffolding nor for those
who were ready for more challenge.

Andy also undertook some reading around pupil groupings, to explore a range of options. He re-read the Research and Practice Summaries from Module 3 of the programme and checked his Learning Log. He was especially interested in how, when grouping pupils, care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation (4.10); that, when this was done, paired and group activities can increase pupil success (4.9); changing groups regularly can help avoid the perception that groups are fixed (5n); and flexibly grouping pupils within a class could help him provide more tailored support (5.5). He understood that one important factor in supporting effective collaborative or paired work would be building his pupils’ familiarity with routines (4o).

<strong>
  What alteration to his teaching might Andy make to improve the effectiveness
  of his pupils’ work in groups?
</strong>
$CTA

### Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively

Following discussion with his TA, Andy devised a system whereby all pupils would be obliged to work regularly with two different groups. He took the following steps:

- from the start of a half-term, he introduced a ‘dual grouping’ system in which each pupil was assigned one table group by mixed attainment; and another by a hierarchy of need – where pupils were grouped with others with similar prior attainment for their literacy lessons
- Andy and his TA kept a close eye on the effects of the mixed attainment groups on motivation and behaviour: in the thrice weekly meetings, they discussed these arrangements and were prepared to make adjustments – these adjustments might help communicate to the pupils that their grouping (and their attainment levels) were not fixed
- he made sure each day that there was a structured opportunity for the mixed attainment groups to talk together - for example, about their favourite toys, pets, subjects or favourite television programmes: he hoped this would improve motivation and behaviour
- in their literacy lessons the pupils were regrouped by near attainment. He gave them paper, coloured pencils and a stimulus – such as a toy – for the group to create a story, which they would tell back to the class. Andy concentrated his support on two groups, his TA on one group, and two groups were allowed to work independently. The extra support was to ensure that all pupils were involved in contributing to the group’s story. He was also able to stretch the higher attaining pupils to expand upon their stories by asking them some ‘what if’ questions.

<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>
Vashti (a Year 4 teacher) wants to develop an aspect of her practice in relation to literacy. She has found that around one-third of her pupils are still making basic errors with writing week in, week out – in particular, that they are inconsistent in their use of capital letters, full stops and finger spacing. They don’t seem to respond to her written feedback, and she often has to spend time in lessons going over the same ground. She decides she must develop this aspect of her practice so, with her mentor, she agrees to undertake a practitioner inquiry. To begin her inquiry, she writes two exploratory questions:
<blockquote>How do effective teachers of literacy at Key Stage 2 provide scaffolding and support for struggling writers?

What are the characteristics of pupils who struggle with written literacy in Year 4?</blockquote>
To answer these questions, Vashti first looked at the evidence she already had to hand:

<ul>
  <li>
    She analysed progress data in her mark-book to identify particular pupils
  </li>
  <li>
    She inspected those pupils’ literacy books to compile a list of their common
    errors
  </li>
  <li>
    She also looked back at her Research and Practice Summary from Module 2 and
    in her Learning Log where she had noted writing composition strategies
    through modelling and supported practice
  </li>
  <li>
    She did one extra thing: for twenty minutes, she observed a colleague from
    Key Stage 2 who is known for making good progress in literacy.
  </li>
</ul>
Having pulled together this exploratory data, Vashti drew the following tentative
conclusions:
<ul>
  <li>
    effective teachers use physical resources to provide scaffolding for
    struggling writers – e.g. laminated sheets
  </li>
  <li>
    effective teachers teach different forms of writing by modelling the
    processes of planning, drafting and editing
  </li>
  <li>
    effective teachers use symbols and icons alongside short, written prompts
  </li>
  <li>
    effective teachers harness the power of classroom talk to help children
    organise their thoughts before they put pen to paper
  </li>
  <li>
    effective teachers often pair up struggling writers with higher attaining
    writers.
  </li>
</ul>
Of the six pupils she had identified as struggling, she noticed that five were identified
as having a Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN).

<strong>
  What alteration to her normal modelling and scaffolding might Vashti make to
  support her class to improve their writing?
</strong>
$CTA

### **Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing**

Vashti decided to create a ‘speaking sentences’ intervention, comprised of the following elements:

- create a physical resource – a laminated sheet with an icon and a key word to remind pupils of the basic features of sentence-writing (e.g. capital letter at start of sentence, capital letter for any names, quote marks to denote spoken language, full stop at end of sentence, finger spacing between words) (4a). She used this scaffold first with all pupils, monitored how her pupils used it then gradually withdrew it from those who were successful without it (4c)
- model the use of the resource, graphically and verbally using the visualizer (4g) – she modelled this first, narrating her thought processes explicitly (4i), then three confident pupils used the visualizer to show their classmates how they used the laminated sheet
- create talk partners where target pupils are paired up with stronger writers (4o)
- model and then require high-quality pair talk as a way of supporting the development of their writing – by practising the talking together in full sentences (3r)
- in pairs, each pupil talks through the stages of writing a successful sentence, using the laminated sheet as a scaffold (4p) and then they practise writing together for 10 minutes (4d)
- model the planning, drafting and editing process, whereby pairs have the opportunity to use the laminated sheet to do some interim peer assessment and make improvements to each other’s work (3s)
- after a writing exercise, ensuring peer feedback is specific and helpful (6k), all pupils use the laminated sheet as a checklist to check their partner’s work and suggest corrections if necessary

<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>
Louise (secondary history) is concerned about her marking workload. Department policy
states that books should be marked at least once every two weeks. Louise teaches
9 classes this year, and it takes her 2 hours to mark a set of books. This means
that she typically spends 8 to 10 hours a week marking books. Louise is concerned
about the fact that she isn’t able to spend as much time planning lessons as she
would like. She is also concerned that some of her pupils don’t seem to find her
written feedback useful, as they often make similar mistakes to those she has corrected
the previous week. Following a meeting where she asked her Head of Department whether
she could try some different approaches to marking, Louise agreed with him that she
should develop this area of her practice. She decided to undertake a practitioner
inquiry to explore some other approaches to providing her pupils with feedback. To
get started, she wrote the following, exploratory question:
<blockquote>
  What alternative approaches to providing children with feedback are there, as
  an alternative to written marking?
</blockquote>
To answer this question, Louise first looked at the evidence she could access easily:
<ul>
  <li>
    she raised it as an item in a department meeting, and noted her colleagues’
    alternative ideas about assessment and feedback (6m)
  </li>
  <li>
    she looked back to her learning log from Module 4, in particular the
    references to ‘Making marking manageable and effective’ (6l, 6m, 6n, 6o, 6p,
    6q)
  </li>
  <li>
    she re-read the Research and Practice Summary for Week 5 of Module 4, which
    gave practical guidance on alternative approaches, and she read again the
    example of Sara on ‘Reducing the opportunity costs of marking’
  </li>
</ul>
Louise then chose to read more widely. (ECTs will not often have time to do this.)
She read online Education Endowment Foundation (2016) <em>
  A marked improvement? A review of the evidence on written marking.
</em> Accessible from: <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf">
  https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf
</a>
.

As a result of this exploratory data collection, Louise identified two approaches that she wanted to explore further:

<ul>
  <li>whole-class verbal feedback (6.5, 6n)</li>
  <li>
    an approach known as ‘minimal marking’ whereby the teacher provides feedback
    in the form of abbreviations and codes, rather than making corrections and
    writing out ‘what went well / even better if’ comments in longhand (6p)
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  What alteration to her marking might Louise make so that it is both effective
  and manageable?
</strong>
$CTA

### Louise’s new approach to marking

Louise consulted her department’s marking policy. Then she:

Use of codes (6p):

- created a set of codes to represent the most common kinds of feedback relating to spelling, punctuation and grammar
- created codes to represent the success criteria for each written task she set: whether the pupils had referred to source material (SM), and whether they had written a balanced argument (BA) etc (6k)
- when marking books, instead of writing comments, wrote short codes in the margin (she found that this took around 1 minute per book, or 30 minutes to mark the class set) (6o)
- created a slide with a key explaining what each code meant

Verbal feedback (6.5):

- in the feedback lesson, she would also provide whole-class verbal feedback to highlight any common misconceptions she had noticed when marking the books (6n)
- made sure that her codes led to specific actions for pupils, and provided 15 minutes at the start of lessons for her pupils to respond to the feedback (6h)

<h3>Case Study D: Questioning</h3>
Mo wants to work on his use of questioning with his Year 11 GCSE PE class. He finds
that lots of lesson time is spent on providing pupils with detailed instruction and
feedback about how to meet particular assessment objectives for the exam, and he
sometimes feels that he is working harder than his pupils in lessons. He wants to
improve his use of questioning as a way to stimulate pupils to think, talk and write
more in lessons. Following a meeting with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning,
Mo decides to undertake a practitioner inquiry to help him improve and evaluate his
use of questioning in lessons.

To begin, Mo writes two exploratory questions:

<blockquote>What kinds of questions do I typically ask in lessons?

What kinds of questioning are effective for teachers to use?</blockquote>
Mo’s school has video cameras installed in classrooms for professional development purposes so, to answer the first question, Mo decided to film himself teaching a typical lesson and then watch it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning. (If the technology had not been available, nor a colleague free to observe him, he could instead have trained a pupil to observe him for how he asks questions.) He made a tally of the kinds of questions he asked during the lesson, and brief notes on the way pupils responded to his questioning. He made the following observations:

<ul>
  <li>Mo asked a total of 23 questions in the lesson</li>
  <li>
    of these, 17 were to do with classroom management, rather than content –
    e.g. “Are you OK?”, “Have you got what you need?”, “Do you know what you’re
    supposed to be doing?”
  </li>
  <li>
    when he did ask questions about the content of the lesson, they tended to be
    closed questions (e.g. “Can you name the three bones in the ankle?” “Who can
    tell me what the difference is between concentric and eccentric muscle
    contractions?”)
  </li>
  <li>
    of the 6 questions he asked about lesson content, 3 were addressed to the
    whole class, rather than directing them at particular pupils
  </li>
  <li>
    of 3 questions he directed to particular pupils, Mo did not give the pupils
    much “wait time” – if they paused for more than a second or two, he would
    ask another pupil in order to maintain the pace of the lesson, and to avoid
    the pupil feeling embarrassed if they did not know the answer
  </li>
  <li>
    on one occasion, Mo gave the pupils the opportunity to look up and discuss a
    question before asking them publicly. When he did this, the pupil was able
    to provide a much more in-depth answer. However, Mo did not ask the pupil to
    elaborate further on the answer they provided
  </li>
  <li>
    during the observation, the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning noticed
    that:
    <ul>
      <li>boys spoke more than girls in the lesson</li>
      <li>5 pupils did not speak at all, other than to their table partner</li>
      <li>of these, 4 were Pupil Premium girls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
To answer the second question, Mo spoke informally over lunch to some experienced
colleagues in other subjects. He looked back in his Learning Log from Module 3, and
re-read the Research and Practice Summaries from weeks 3 and 4, paying particular
attention to the example of Christine, teaching metacognitive strategies to her class.
Through this, he identified three key ideas he wanted to explore further – direction,
elaboration and metacognition. In order to develop a more dynamic, responsive approach
to questioning, Mo wrote a plan based around these three key ideas. In particular,
he planned the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    direction - direct questions at particular pupils, having given them time to
    prepare and discuss and answer (4n)
  </li>
  <li>
    focus on the ‘third turn’ (i.e. what he says in response to a pupil’s answer
    to a question), asking follow-up questions to encourage pupils to dig deeper
    in their thinking, and to build on one another’s ideas (5k, 6f) and
  </li>
  <li>
    ask questions that promote metacognition, asking pupils to reflect on their
    existing (and emerging) knowledge and understanding, and helping them plan,
    monitor and evaluate their own learning (4.5, 4l)
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  What alteration to his approach to questioning might help Mo to stimulate his
  pupils to think, talk (and write) more in GCSE PE lessons?
</strong>
$CTA

### **Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improving questioning**

He printed out a set of prompt questions and left them on his desk, so that he could refer to them at a glance during the lesson if he needed a reminder. (e.g. What if I told you the opposite was true? Why does that answer make sense to you? How do you know? How might you argue against this? Which ideas make the most sense and why?)

Mo understands that questions can be used for many purposes (4.6) therefore, the kinds of questions teachers ask need to be adapted in relation to the purpose of the questioning. As a general guide, Mo creates a list of principles of ‘responsive questioning’ that he can draw on at different times, to suit the aims of the lesson:

- organise the class into pairs
- when I ask a question, give each pair 2 minutes to discuss it, and to consult their notes / the textbook if need be (4.7, 4n)
- use a class list to make sure I direct at least one question at each pupil at some point in the lesson (direction) (5.3)
- ask a variety of questions: open, closed, content-based, process-based, exploratory, retrieval, checking, linking ideas (4m)
- where appropriate, give up to 10 seconds of wait time before moving on (e.g. if they haven’t had time to prepare an answer in advance) (4n)
- where possible/appropriate, ask pupils to elaborate on their answers on the ‘third turn’ (elaboration) (6f)
- use the question list to build on each pupil’s answer, reframing questions and directing questions to other pupils in the class (5k)
- ask pupils questions that help them see the constituent parts, to encourage them to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning (metacognition) (4e)

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 5 mins

Read the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:

1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation
2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you
3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry

### Plan: 5 mins

#### **Action planning**

In your mentor meeting at the start of this module, you decided with your mentor what your exploratory question would be and how you would collect evidence of the impact upon your pupils of your normal practice.

Plan out how you are going to do that, e.g.

- if you are going to collect some pupil voice feedback, who will you collect it from and when will you do it?
- if you are going to ask a colleague to observe a part of your lesson, who will that be and when will they observe you?
- if you are going to collaborate with a colleague, like Vashti, Louise and Mo, who will that be and how will you manage your time?

The exploratory phase of your inquiry – just like with Modules 6 and 7 – is very short, so you should not attempt to collect large amounts of data. However, do try to ensure that the data you collect is valid for your inquiry, i.e. that it offers evidence to help you answer your question.

### Theory to Practice: 40 mins

How you collect your evidence will depend upon the exploratory question you are asking and the sources of evidence you decided you needed. However, it is likely to include the following:

#### 1. Analyse artefact and data

Your question may have been something like:

‘To what extent do my lesson plans suggest that I am organising activities around what I want my pupils to think hard about?’

‘What aspects of my current teaching of pupils with SEND are recommended within the SEND Code of Practice?’

‘Looking at the data I have over a number of assessments, what tentative conclusions can I draw about the patterns of my pupils’ performance?’

It is useful to remember that pupil work – whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written – is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question. School policies and codes of practice are useful artefacts to explore, as are curriculum plans and mark books.

When collecting this sort of data, it is helpful to bear in mind:

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |
| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s previous learning record reliable evidence of their learning patterns now?                                                                                            |
| Manageability | For a short exploratory inquiry such as this, you must be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes – for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources – is a handy way to make sense of the data.                                            |

Vashti analysed progress data to identify particular pupils who needed support with writing, and she conducted a book scrutiny to compile a list of common errors in those pupils’ books. Louise raised an item in a department meeting to discover alternative approaches to marking. Mo filmed himself teaching a typical lesson and then watched it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning.

All of these methods were manageable and gave them a reliable snapshot of their (or their colleagues’) normal practice.

#### 2. Discuss with pupils

Your question may have been something like:

‘To what extent do I currently take account of my pupils’ levels of prior understanding when I introduce new content to them? What do my pupils say about this?’

‘Do all my pupils – regardless of prior attainment – agree that I have high expectations of them? Do I adapt lessons appropriately to support and challenge all pupils?’

‘When I use peer assessment, is the feedback from the pupils specific enough to help move their learning on?’

For all of these questions, it would be useful to make pupil voice part of your evidence gathering. When collecting evidence of pupils’ attitudes in a short inquiry, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                |
| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. Open questions may give you rich data, but it can be arduous to analyse; closed questions (or ones when you ask pupils to place themselves on a 1-5 scale) are easy to analyse but might tell you less than you wish to know. Some combination of open and closed might be a good way forward for you. |

#### 3. Self-assessment

In preparation for your mentor meeting, write a simple evidence statement to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about your normal practice. This does not have to be definitive.

e.g.

Andy, in Case Study A, said:

> ‘At the start of the year with my Year 1s, I arranged my groups randomly because I did not know them very well. I found in my exploratory inquiry, by talking to my TA, that some pupils were apparently reluctant to work with others because they didn’t know them, and others were worried about what the other children might think if they make a mistake with their learning. I realised also that my TA and I were unable to give our pupils the levels of support and challenge they needed. I have decided that I need to build their confidence to work with others, not just their friends. I also need to group them so I can better tailor my support to them.’

Louise, in Case Study C, said:

> ‘I teach 9 different history classes so it can take me up to 10 hours a week to mark their books according to the department policy. I spoke to the other teachers in my department and found that they were keeping within their policies but taking other approaches, like whole-class verbal feedback. They also told be about something they called ‘minimal marking’ whereby the teacher provides feedback in the form of abbreviations and codes, rather than making corrections and writing out ‘what went well / even better if’ comments in longhand. I definitely need to try methods like these, to see if my pupils can maintain their current progress without me marking so much.’

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your simple evidence statement and any supporting data to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.

In that meeting, you will discuss with your mentor any alteration to your practice that might make a positive difference to your pupils.

## Learning Intentions for this session

The focus of your inquiry for Module 8 is on an element of the Early Career Framework (ECF) from Standards 4, 5 or 6. You might have chosen a focus which combines different elements of these standards.

By reading about the case studies’ evidence of impact so far, you can recap that:

| **Case Study A**                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Introduction

For several weeks now you have been using the ECF to guide developments to your practice; you have been implementing alterations to your normal practice and formed this into a Module 8 evaluative inquiry question. You may have introduced an adjustment – e.g. because you felt your pupils were ready for a different challenge, or because you wanted to expand the focus of your inquiry. Last week, your mentor observed you and gave you feedback which adds to your evidence base.

This week, you have some time to collate your evidence to this point. What are you learning about the way you are teaching now – and the impact this has on your pupils? Can you make a tentative claim for what you know so far?

$I

<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>
Schools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make
use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’
work – and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils
– and what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection,
in the main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are
saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do
this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few
pupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with
a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I

Next week, you have another mentor meeting. It will be the mid-point review of your inquiry, when you will revisit the audit you conducted at the start of Module 8.

## Case Studies

You have seen these case studies before: they explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment.

You can read back to Weeks 3 or 5, if you want to remind yourself of the issue they wanted to tackle and the alterations to their practice that they implemented.

We pick them up here from the point where they have framed their evaluative inquiry question. We see the methods they decide to use to collect evidence; we see how some of them choose to make a further adjustment to their practice after starting their inquiries; and we begin to see evidence of impact on them and their pupils as this begins to emerge.

**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

$I

<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>
<h4>Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively in Year 1</h4>
To evaluate the impact of his pupil grouping intervention, Andy wrote the
following evaluative question:
<blockquote>
  How can I use group activities over two half-terms to improve the engagement
  and attainment of my Year 1 pupils?
</blockquote>
Andy considered the following sources of data:
<ul>
  <li>
    brief observation notes made by himself and the Teaching Assistant (TA)
    during the lessons and shared briefly after school three times a week
  </li>
  <li>
    his own observations and reflections on the extent to which the pupil
    grouping intervention was having the desired effect on their engagement
  </li>
  <li>
    the progress records for his class that he had been updating twice weekly to
    measure their attainment
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Further adjustments</h4>
Andy was aware that this intervention might cause some pupils some distress, as he
was nudging them out of their comfort zones. He was therefore prepared to experience
a certain amount of pushback at first, while the children adjusted to this new way
of working. He made time to listen to any of their concerns at the beginning of lunchtime,
and found that after a few days, the complaints dried up as the children adapted
to this new way of working.

The following half-term as he monitored the impact of the group activities, Andy decided to make a further adjustment, whereby pupils were required to work in near attainment groups for all literacy and numeracy lessons: this would help him to target his and his TA’s support for particular groups of pupils. The pupils would then return to their mixed attainment group tables when studying other topics. He reminded himself of some of the other reading he had done of Research and Practice Summaries in year 1, this time relating to setting high expectations (Standard 1) and managing behaviour effectively (Standard 7). Throughout the inquiry period, Andy repeatedly reminded the children of the aim they were all working towards – to be able to work and talk productively with everyone in the class (1.3). Andy reinforced good behaviour with the use of verbal praise and by awarding house points, publicly celebrating the features of productive talk he wanted to see more of, such as listening carefully, sharing resources and building on the ideas of others (7.6, 7o).
$I

### Evidence of impact so far

The ECF statements, across several standards, helped Andy to make sense of what his evidence was telling him.

From the evidence he has collected so far, Andy understands that:

**1.3** Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.

- by repeatedly making his intentions clear, he has been able to ‘bring the children with him’ on this journey to helping them to work productively with any of their peers

**4.9.** Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.

- by using the same method in every literacy lesson for a term, and extending this to numeracy lessons after one half-term – and switching between mixed and near attainment groupings - he has given the children many opportunities to practise working with others, and therefore to get better at doing so over time

**4.10.** How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.

- a small number of the mixed attainment groupings have proven problematic, but
- several of his pupils have become much more confident in working with a wider range of peers

Through engaging in the inquiry so far, Andy has also learned better how to:

Communicate a belief in the academic potential of all of his pupils, by:

**1a.** Using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration.

- his TA – who had been working in Key Stage 1 for many years – feels the class have made much faster progress than other classes she has known

And he has:

**1e.** Created a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils).

- publicly celebrating the features of productive talk he wanted to see more of, such as listening carefully, sharing resources and building on the ideas of others

<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>
Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing in Year 4.

To ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Vashti devised this evaluative inquiry question:

<blockquote>
  How can I use ‘speaking sentences’ well, over the space of two terms, to
  reduce the prevalence of basic errors in written literacy among pupils with a
  Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN) in Year 4?
</blockquote>
Vashti considered the following evidence she already had to hand:
<ul>
  <li>data from her marking of writing assessments from the target class</li>
  <li>
    data from her colleagues’ marking of writing assessments from her control
    group, the two other year 4 classes (they record such data centrally in her
    school)
  </li>
  <li>
    personal reflections and observations generated through dialogue in her
    mentor meetings, and recorded in her Learning Log
  </li>
</ul>
Additionally, she held a short, 5-minute ‘focus group’ with the 4 target pupils at
the start and end of the intervention.
<h4>Further adjustments</h4>
Halfway through the study period, Vashti noticed that the pupils were improving in
some aspects of their writing. However, they were still often mis-spelling high frequency
words. As a result of this mid-cycle analysis, she realised she could use her scaffold
to more deliberately plan for her pupils to be exposed to high-utility high-frequency
vocabulary (3o): she decided to add a table of high-frequency words to the laminated
scaffold sheet, with the correct spelling in the ‘tick’ column, and common mis-spellings
in the ‘cross’ column. Because she was encouraged by her early observations and reflections,
she also expanded the use of ‘speaking sentences’ to all pupils in her class, with
three levels of scaffold sheets adapted for her pupils’ prior attainment, monitor
their use and withdraw them as her pupils became more successful (4a, 4c). $I

### Evidence of impact so far

The ECF statements, across several standards, helped Vashti to make sense of what her evidence was telling her about her own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, she learned better how to:

**6b.** Draw conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance).

- 5 of the 6 target SpLCN pupils have made significant progress in the summative writing assessment

**4d.** Provide sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and practise applying new knowledge and skills.

- several pupils are able to describe how they have benefited from using the laminated sheet and the speaking activity to organise their thinking and their writing

Reflecting on her findings, Vashti drew the following interim conclusion for her own teaching:

Classroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful
driver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4. (4a, 4p)

She realised that she should continue with this approach to supporting her pupils’ writing, but keep a careful eye on the successful use of the scaffold, so her pupils could still succeed when she withdrew it.

$I

<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>
Louise’s new approach to marking in Secondary History.

To ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Louise devised this evaluative inquiry question:

<blockquote>
  How can I implement codes and verbal feedback well, so that my Year 9 History
  pupils are able to correct misconceptions and make progress, and I am able to
  reduce the amount of time I spend marking?
</blockquote>
To evaluate the impact of her ‘minimal marking’ intervention, Louise decided to collect
the following naturally occurring data:
<ul>
  <li>
    pupil voice – using a hands-up survey in class – with the experimental class
    (before and after the half-term), to capture how well they felt they had
    been guided to improve their work
  </li>
  <li>book scrutiny of a sample of target pupils</li>
  <li>
    summative assessment of a written piece, from both of her classes so she
    could compare
  </li>
  <li>
    focus group conversation (5 min lunchtime conversation with target pupils)
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Further adjustments</h4>
After using her new method once, Louise noticed that some of her pupils didn’t
seem to understand how they were supposed to respond to the coded feedback. She
also realised that she was not always allowing them enough time in lesson to
respond to her feedback.

In the next lesson, she used a visualizer to model how she expected pupils to respond to each of the codes, and gave her pupils a second chance to respond to her feedback (4a)

In addition to the slide, where she had explained the most common codes, she added a ‘Time to Respond’ box – as a reminder both to herself and her pupils. (6h)

### Evidence of impact so far

The ECF statements, across several standards, helped Louise to make sense of what her evidence was telling her about her own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, she learned better how to:

**6p.** Reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal feedback

- she was able to cut the marking time for a set of books from 2 hours to 30 minutes
- her two Year 9 classes (one experimental, one control group) achieved a very similar distribution of scores in a summative written assessment
- her pupils in the experimental group had not encountered any significant problems as a result of the new way of marking

**6h.** Give whole-class feedback so they know what they need to do to improve and have the time to do it.

- she practised giving whole-class feedback, having created a standard slide, which reminded her to give specific feedback and 15 minutes a lesson to do it

Based on these findings, Louise made the following tentative claims from her inquiry:

- using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress, compared with a standard written marking approach
- on average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher over an hour a week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach

Having reviewed her practice in this way, she will use this insight to now apply the same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and Year 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.

<h3>Case Study D: Questioning</h3>
<h4>Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improve questioning in GCSE PE</h4>
To ensure he was developing his practice effectively, Mo devised this evaluative
inquiry question:
<blockquote>
  How can I best adapt the way I ask questions, implemented every lesson for one
  term, to improve the quality and amount of talk among Pupil Premium girls in
  Y11 GCSE PE?
</blockquote>
To help him answer this question, Mo decided to collect the following data:
<ul>
  <li>
    arrange a follow-up lesson observation with the Assistant Head for Teaching
    and Learning, using the school’s in-class video technology
  </li>
  <li>
    interview a sample of pupils, including Pupil Premium girls, in a focus
    group lasting 5 minutes after final period on a Wednesday
  </li>
  <li>
    book scrutiny, sampling 6 of the target pupils, compared with a sample of 6
    high attaining pupils – Mo marks these books every other week, so this data
    is near to hand
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Further adjustments</h4>
Once he started collecting evidence, Mo decided he needed to make one adjustment
to his approach for the inquiry. In particular, based on his marking of books, he
wrote key questions that he would target at particular pupils, to make sure that
he was able to check understanding and fill gaps as they progress from one lesson
to the next. (6a)

Mo also started using his new approach to ‘responsive questioning’ with his other classes. (4m)
$I

### Evidence of impact so far

The ECF statements, across several standards, helped Mo to make sense of what his evidence was telling him about his own practice. Through engaging in the inquiry so far, he learned better how to:

**4m.** Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils

- he saw much more evidence of high-quality questioning in his second filmed lesson
- all 16 pupils were asked a question at some point in the lesson

**6f.** Prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding

- all were asked follow-up questions to help them elaborate on their thinking
- there was a change in the books of the Pupil Premium girls during the inquiry period – their written responses were far more articulate and well-structured, reflecting the discussions they had had in class

**4n.** Provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required

- all were given sufficient wait time
- the pupils liked the fact that he gave them time to prepare an answer before calling on them

Based on this, Mo made the following tentative claim from his inquiry so far:

> Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality
> of talk and writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.

And because he had developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo decided to apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 5 mins

Read the case studies on this week’s topic, or the one that is most relevant to the exploratory question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:

1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation
2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you
3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry

### Plan: 5 mins

#### Action planning

Take a few minutes to plan how you will use your self-directed study time this week. Think about:

- what evidence you already have for the way you teach now, and the impact it has on your pupils, e.g.

  - your module audit
  - observation notes from last week
  - the work your pupils are producing
  - what your pupils are saying in class, how they are responding to feedback

- what evidence it would still be useful for you to collect, e.g.

  - the views of your pupils about this change in your practice – how has it altered their attitudes to learning?
  - how the responses of your pupils to the change in your teaching may have altered over time – some may have started well but begun to level off. Can you track that?
  - how the change in your practice is affecting different pupils in different ways
  - the impact of your inquiry on yourself

So, this week you might divide your time between analysing evidence you already have and designing a collection tool for evidence you don’t.

### Theory to Practice: 40 mins

How you collect your evidence will depend upon the area of your practice that you are seeking to improve and the evaluative inquiry question you are asking. However, it is likely to include the following:

#### 1. Analyse artefacts and data

Remind yourself of the area of your practice that you are trying to improve and of your evaluative inquiry question, and think again about the sources of evidence that might shed light upon it. These might include ‘artefacts’ such as the following:

- your pupils’ work – whether written, spoken, performed, or created
- your assessment of pieces of work, and your assessment of the pupils over time – and how that compares with other pupils, or expected outcomes
- policy and guidance documents
- lesson plans, curriculum plans, learning resources
- observations by you or of you

It is useful to remember that pupil work – whether it is performed (as in art, drama, music, PE, technology), spoken or written – is a source of evidence. By assessing that work, which you do as a normal part of your professional life, you can bring that evidence to bear on your inquiry question. You should realise that this is work you have already done – not extra work.

School policies and codes of practice are useful artefacts to explore, as are curriculum plans and mark books.

Whether analysing data you already have, or creating an evidence collection tool, it is helpful to bear in mind:

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validity      | The sources you analyse will contain much more data than you need for your inquiry. It may be interesting, but don’t be distracted: only collect the evidence that helps answer your question. For example, if you are investigating the boys in a class, look for the data only on them. |
| Reliability   | The data you find might be true for a particular time in the past – is it still true now? For example, is a pupil’s previous learning record reliable evidence of their learning patterns now?                                                                                            |
| Manageability | Be selective: don’t attempt to analyse all possible sources. Creating codes – for when you spot similar issues arising in different sources – is a handy way to make sense of the data.                                                                                                   |

Andy asked his TA to keep brief observation notes and discuss them with him at the end of the day; he also took a note of his own observations of the extent to which the pupil grouping intervention was having the desired effect.

Vashti inspected progress data from writing assessments for her own class, and compared this with two other year 4 classes (which are acting as her control group); she is also keeping a note of her personal reflections.

Louise analysed a summative assessment (and compared this with another of her classes, her control group); she also conducted a book scrutiny of her class’s books with a colleague.

Mo filmed a second lesson to compare it with the first, and likewise watched it back with the Assistant Head for Teaching and Learning; like Louise, he also conducted a book scrutiny of his PE class’s books with a colleague.

All of these methods were manageable and gave them a reliable insight into the emerging effects of the alterations to their practice and their evaluative inquiries.

#### 2. Discuss with pupils

Remind yourself of the area of your practice that you are trying to improve and of your evaluative inquiry question and think again about the sources of evidence that might shed light upon it. These might include examples of pupil voice such as the following:

- focus interviews with ‘target’ pupils – you can often do these during a lesson, while others are working independently
- surveys conducted in class (e.g. where you ask pupils to put their hand up if they agree, or they answer a small number of questions instantly)
- when you ‘eavesdrop’ on pupils as they discuss an issue with a partner
- whole class discussion on the issue you want feedback on

When analysing evidence of pupils’ attitudes to learning, or creating a pupil voice evidence collection method, it is helpful to bear these three rules in mind when asking your questions:

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are they valid?    | Only ask the questions that you need the answers to for your inquiry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Are they reliable? | Make sure your pupils understand the questions, and that you understand their answers. Can you trust the answers they give you? Pupils might give you more honest answers if they can do it anonymously. Are you asking the ‘right’ pupils? Try to ensure that they are representative of the group you are interested in. Ask enough pupils, but…                                                                                                                                                |
| Is it manageable?  | Don’t collect more data than you can handle in the time. If you teach 30 pupils, it might be sufficient to ask 5 of them; if you teach 7 classes, you could collect data from one of them. Open questions may give you rich data, but it can be arduous to analyse; closed questions (or ones when you ask pupils to place themselves on a 1-5 scale) are easy to analyse but might tell you less than you wish to know. Some combination of open and closed might be a good way forward for you. |

Vashti also carried out individual interviews with each of the 4 target pupils at the start and end of her inquiry (taking 5 minutes each with them, while other pupils worked independently); similarly, Mo interviewed a sample of pupils, including the Pupil Premium girls who were his focus.

Louise carried out a hands-up pupil survey with her experimental class (before and after the half-term), to capture their thoughts on marking, and followed this up with a focus group conversation with a small group of pupils for 10 minute at lunchtime.

#### 3. Self-assessment – making the claim

In preparation for your mentor meeting next week (where you will revisit your Module 8 audit), write a ‘claim’ to describe what the evidence seems to be saying about the impacts of your alteration to practice. This will still not be definitive: there are still some weeks to go before your inquiry is finished. It is useful to get into the habit of evaluating the impact of what you are doing, to help you decide in the future what you will continue to do, what you will do more of, and perhaps what you will stop doing.

If you have been using multiple methods of data collection – however simple – this will strengthen your claim. If you feel something is so, if your pupils say it is so, and if your progress data suggests it is so, then you can make a fairly strong claim.

Not all inquiries lead to positive results. Inquiries that lead to uncertain conclusions are not a waste of time – quite the reverse, such inquiries often generate more questions for further investigation. Disappointing findings can also be incredibly valuable.

Here are the claims made by some of the teachers featured in the case studies.

**Vashti:**

Through her inquiry, Vashti was learning better how to plan effective lessons, by (4a) using scaffolds for pupils who needed more structure; better how to stimulate her pupils’ thinking, by (4p, 3r) providing scaffolds for talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue; and better how to provide frequent opportunities for her pupils, in pairs, to plan, draft and edit their writing. Her claim is:

> Classroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful
> driver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4.

She is going to keep monitoring her use of the ‘speaking sentences’ scaffold.

**Louise:**

Through experimenting with ‘minimal marking’ as an alternative to always giving full written feedback, she learned better how to reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal feedback (6p). She also learned better how to give whole-class feedback so they knew what they needed to do to improve, and had the time to do it. (6h) Her claims therefore are:

> 1\. Using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress, compared with a standard written marking approach.

> 2\. On average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher about an hour a week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach.

She will use this insight to now apply the same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and Year 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.

**Mo:**

Through expanding his range of questioning approaches, Mo learned better how to include a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (4m), provide appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required (4n), and prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding (6f). Based on this, his claim is:

> Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality
> of talk and writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.

And because he has developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo has decided to apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your claim to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.

In that meeting, you will revisit the audit that you completed at the start of Module 8. To that end, you may also bring other supporting evidence to discuss your progress across Standards 4, 5 and 6.

## Session Elements

- practical exercise
- rehearsal
- self-assessment

## Learning Intentions for this session

The focus of your inquiry for Module 8 is on an element of the Early Career Framework (ECF) from Standards 4, 5 or 6. You might have chosen a focus which combines different elements of these standards.

$I
Look at the individual case studies below to see what the featured teachers had learned by this stage of their inquiries.

In this session you will learn that engaging in practitioner inquiry, focused on the evidence base of the ECF, can have positive effects, not only on your practical knowledge, but also your beliefs, your workload and your professional relationships.
$I

## Introduction

Last week with your mentor you considered the wider range of emergent evidence for your inquiry: not just the evidence you collected deliberately (and for which you had an anticipated outcome) but the overheard and unexpected evidence too. Before that, you reminded yourself of the counter-evidence, or the potential negative consequences of your inquiry. Last week, you updated your ‘claim’ to take account of inferences you can make from all of these forms of evidence.

How valid are the inferences you made? In this week’s self-study time, you should firm up the evidence to support the inferences you made last week.

Finally, you are going to create an account of the impact on you of engaging in practitioner inquiry.

$I

<h3>A note on evidence and workload</h3>
Schools are already data-rich environments. Practitioner inquiries first of all make
use of what we call here ‘naturally occurring’ evidence. They are in the pupils’
work and your assessment of it. They are in the words and reactions of the pupils
and what you have heard or seen of this. When we refer to evidence-collection, in
the main we mean: look at what the pupils have done, and listen to what they are
saying. A practitioner inquiry invites you to be more systematic about how you do
this looking and listening, so you might deliberately ask a few questions of a few
pupils for five minutes at the start of breaktime, or you might share lunch with
a colleague and quiz them about how they approach a problem in their own class. $I

## Case Studies

You have seen these case studies before: they explore how four teachers – improving their practice and without adding to their workload – conducted their own practitioner inquiries into developing quality pedagogy and making productive use of assessment.

You can read back to Weeks 3 or 5, if you want to remind yourself of the issue they wanted to tackle and the alterations to their practice that they implemented.

Here we see the inferences they make from the range of evidence they collected. We also begin to see the range of impacts the inquiries have had upon them personally: on their beliefs, workload and relationships with colleagues.

**When reading these case studies, you will need to take account of your own pupils’ characteristics, the context of your classroom and the nature of the material that you are teaching.**

$I

<h3>Case Study A: Grouping Pupils Effectively</h3>
<h4>Andy’s approach to grouping pupils effectively in Year 1</h4>
Andy devised this evaluative question:
<blockquote>
  How can I use group activities over two half-terms to improve the engagement
  and attainment of my Year 1 pupils?
</blockquote>
After making small adjustments to his inquiry to account for pupils’ feedback,
he was able to draw these insights from the deliberate evidence:
<ul>
  <li>his pupil grouping interventions have largely been effective</li>
  <li>
    a small number of the mixed attainment groupings have proven problematic
  </li>
  <li>
    by repeatedly making his intentions clear, he has been able to ‘bring the
    children with him’ on this journey to helping them to work productively with
    any of their peers
  </li>
  <li>
    by using the same method every literacy lesson for a term, extending this to
    numeracy after one half-term and switching between mixed and near attainment
    groupings, he has given the children many opportunities to practise working
    with others, and therefore to get better at doing so over time
  </li>
  <li>
    several of his pupils have become much more confident in working with a
    wider range of peers
  </li>
  <li>
    his TA – who had been working in Key Stage 1 for many years – feels the
    class have made much faster progress than other classes she has known
  </li>
</ul>
From the wider emergent (overhead and unexpected) evidence, Andy made these
inferences:
<ul>
  <li>
    he overheard his pupils say things like ‘I used to not like working with X,
    but now I like it’ – the new pupil grouping is having the desired effect
  </li>
  <li>
    his Year 1s overall made unexpectedly rapid progress with the accuracy of
    their mark making – the new pupil grouping improved the pupils socially and
    in their written literacy
  </li>
</ul>
$I

### The impact the inquiry has had on Andy’s beliefs and professional relationships

The inquiry involved Andy working more productively with his TA. He is now much firmer in his belief that:

**1.1** teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils

**1.3** teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential

**4.1** effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge

**4.7** high-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary

**4.9** paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice

**5.5** flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils

**7.6** pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward)

**8.7** engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve

$I

<h3>Case Study B: Modelling and Scaffolding</h3>
<h4>Vashti’s use of modelling and scaffolds to support writing in Year 4</h4>
To ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Vashti devised this
evaluative inquiry question:
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    How can I use ‘speaking sentences’ well, over the space of two terms, to
    reduce the prevalence of basic errors in written literacy among pupils with
    a Speech, Language and Communication Need (SpLCN) in Year 4?
  </p>
</blockquote>
After making small adjustments to her inquiry – because her pupils were still
often mis-spelling high frequency words – she was able to draw these insights
from the deliberate evidence:

<strong>6b.</strong> Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking
at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments
draw inferences about learning from performance).
<ul>
  <li>
    5 of the 6 target SpLCN pupils have made significant progress in the
    summative writing assessment
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>4d.</strong> Providing sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate
and practise applying new knowledge and skills.
<ul>
  <li>
    several pupils are able to describe how they have benefited from using the
    laminated sheet and the speaking activity to organise their thinking and
    their writing
  </li>
</ul>
Reflecting on her findings, Vashti drew the following interim conclusion for her
own teaching:
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Classroom talk, combined with scaffolding resources, can be a powerful
    driver for improving written literacy among pupils with SpLCN in Year 4.
    (4a, 4p)
  </p>
</blockquote>
She realised that she should continue with this approach to supporting her
pupils’ writing, but keep a careful eye on the successful use of the scaffold,
so her pupils could still succeed when she withdrew it.

From the wider emergent (overhead and unexpected) evidence, Vashti made these inferences:

<ul>
  <li>
    she overheard several of the non-SpLCN pupils, but who also have other
    additional needs, say that the ‘speaking sentences’ approach made them much
    more confident when writing – the approach can work with all pupils who have
    additional needs
  </li>
  <li>
    unexpectedly, the oracy of the SpLCN pupils also improved markedly over the
    period – scaffolds which reduce basic errors in one area of literacy may
    also have a similar effect in others
  </li>
</ul>
She inferred that this was because she had learned better how to:

<strong>3r.</strong> Model and require high-quality oral language, recognising that
it underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond
to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary)

<strong>3s.</strong> Teaching different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting
and editing

<strong>4a.</strong> Use modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that
novices need more structure early in a domain

<strong>4d.</strong> Provide sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and
practise applying new knowledge and skills.

<strong>4p.</strong> Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour
of dialogue. $I

### The impact the inquiry has had on Vashti’s beliefs, workload and professional relationships

The inquiry involved Vashti observing three colleagues. She is now much firmer in her belief that:

**3.10** Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines

**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge

**4.4** Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases

**4.7** High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary

**5.1** Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed

**5.3** Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success

**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve

She has also saved on her workload because she has learned that:

**5.4** Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils

<h3>Case Study C: Making Marking Manageable</h3>
<h4>Louise’s new approach to marking in Secondary History</h4>
To ensure she was developing her practice effectively, Louise devised this
evaluative inquiry question:
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    How can I implement codes and verbal feedback well, so that my Year 9
    History pupils are able to correct misconceptions and make progress, and I
    am able to reduce the amount of time I spend marking?
  </p>
</blockquote>
Louise noticed that some of her pupils didn’t seem to understand how they were
supposed to respond to the coded feedback. After making small adjustments to her
inquiry she was able to draw these insights from the deliberate evidence:

<strong>6p.</strong> Reduce the opportunity cost of marking by using codes and verbal
feedback
<ul>
  <li>
    she was able to cut the marking time for a set of books from 2 hours to 30
    minutes
  </li>
  <li>
    her two Year 9 classes (one experimental, one control group) achieved a very
    similar distribution of scores in a summative written assessment
  </li>
  <li>
    her pupils in the experimental group had not encountered any significant
    problems as a result of the new way of marking
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>6h.</strong> Give whole-class feedback so they know what they need to do
to improve and have the time to do it.
<ul>
  <li>
    she practised giving whole-class feedback, having created a standard slide,
    which reminded her to give specific feedback and 15 minutes a lesson to do
    it
  </li>
</ul>
Based on these findings, Louise made the following tentative claims from her
inquiry:
<ul>
  <li>
    Using codes/verbal feedback does not detrimentally affect pupil progress,
    compared with a standard written marking approach.
  </li>
  <li>
    On average, using codes/verbal feedback saves the teacher about an hour a
    week, per teaching class, compared with a standard written marking approach.
  </li>
</ul>
Having reviewed her practice in this way, she will use this insight to now apply
the same principles of verbal feedback and minimal marking to her Year 7 and
Year 8 classes, while monitoring the impact of that on her pupils and herself.

From the wider emergent (overheard and unexpected) evidence, Louise made these inferences:

<ul>
  <li>
    she overheard several high prior attaining girls in her experimental Year 9
    class say that they preferred the new form of feedback, because they
    received it much more quickly – pupils don’t necessarily ‘miss’ having their
    work marked all of the time
  </li>
  <li>
    she overheard a few pupils in her control Year 9 class say they heard what
    she was doing in her other class, and ‘why can’t we have that?’ – verbal and
    coded feedback might be popular with pupils
  </li>
  <li>
    expectedly, she saved time on marking; unexpectedly, she used that gained
    time to prepare better lessons – reducing unnecessary marking can have an
    overall positive impact on her teaching
  </li>
</ul>
She inferred that this was because she had learned better how to:

<strong>6h</strong> Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for pupils
to respond to feedback

<strong>6i</strong> Appreciate that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending
on a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains…)

<strong>6n</strong> Use verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback
after lessons where possible

<strong>6p</strong> Reduce the opportunity cost of marking (e.g. by using abbreviations
and codes in written feedback) $I

### The impact the inquiry has had on Louise’s beliefs and workload

She is now much firmer in her belief that:

**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning

**6.1** Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs

**6.4** To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect

**6.5** High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve

**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve

She has also saved on her workload because she has learned that:

**6.7** Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Case Study D: Questioning</h3>
<h4>Mo’s use of direction and elaboration to improve questioning in GCSE PE</h4>
To ensure he was developing his practice effectively, Mo devised this evaluative
inquiry question:
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    How can I best adapt the way I ask questions, implemented every lesson for
    one term, to improve the quality and amount of talk among Pupil Premium
    girls in Y11 GCSE PE?
  </p>
</blockquote>
After extending his approach to his other classes, he was able to draw these
insights from the deliberate evidence:

<strong>4m.</strong> Include a range of types of questions in class discussions to
extend and challenge pupils
<ul>
  <li>
    he saw much more evidence of high-quality questioning in his second filmed
    lesson
  </li>
  <li>all 16 pupils were asked a question at some point in the lesson</li>
</ul>
<strong>6f.</strong> Prompt pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning
to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding

▪ all were asked follow-up questions to help them elaborate on their thinking

▪ there was a change in the books of the Pupil Premium girls during the inquiry period – their written responses were far more articulate and well-structured, reflecting the discussions they had had in class

<strong>4n.</strong> Provide appropriate wait time between question and response
where more developed responses are required

▪ all were given sufficient wait time

▪ the pupils liked the fact that he gave them time to prepare an answer before calling on them

Based on this, Mo made the following tentative claim from his inquiry so far:

<blockquote>
  Responsive questioning is a useful tool for improving the quality of talk and
  writing among Pupil Premium girls in Year 11 GCSE PE.
</blockquote>
And because he had developed his questioning practice to this extent, Mo decided
to apply the same approaches to his other classroom-based lessons.

From the wider emergent (overheard and unexpected) evidence, Mo made these inferences:

▪ he overheard pupils outside of his focus group comment on his new approach to questioning. ‘Sir makes us think much harder these days.’ – this approach can work for all, not just some, pupils

▪ a colleague in the staffroom told him he had heard about Mo’s approach to questioning, and asked for more information – doing an inquiry about an aspect of teaching can improve collaborative relationships with colleagues

▪ the Pupil Premium girls also improved with their practical PE work – although tempted, Mo could not infer from that that his approach to questioning improves their sporting skills

He inferred that this was because he had learned better how to:

<strong>4l.</strong> Plan activities around what you want pupils to think hard about

<strong>8f.</strong> Contribute positively to the wider school culture and develop
a feeling of shared responsibility for improving the lives of all pupils within the
school $I

### The impact the inquiry has had on Mo’s beliefs and professional relationships

The inquiry involved Mo watching videos of his lessons with an Assistant Headteacher. He is now much firmer in his belief that:

**4.1** Effective teachers can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about knowledge

**4.5** Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success

**4.6** Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems

**4.7** High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary

**8.7** Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve

With regard to professional relationships, Mo has also learned that:

**8.3** Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues.

## Self-Study Activities

### Review: 5 mins

Read the case studies on this module’s topics, or the one or two that are most relevant to the evaluative question you are investigating. As you read, reflect on:

1. how similar this scenario is to your own situation
2. how, despite any differences there may be to your own context, this case study may still be relevant to you
3. what lessons there might be for the way you conduct your own inquiry

### Plan: 5 mins

#### Action planning

Take a few minutes to plan how you will use your self-directed study time this week. Think about:

- what evidence you already have e.g.

  - the evidence you have been deliberately collecting all along
  - the counter-evidence i.e. that which might point you to negative outcomes of your inquiry

- what evidence you still need to collect e.g.

  - overhead evidence – you didn’t collect this deliberately, but it was there
  - unexpected evidence – for outcomes you did not anticipate

So, this week you might divide your time between collecting this wider evidence and making inferences from it (such as you did in your mentor meeting last week), and analysing the broader impacts of the inquiry on yourself. Remember, the evidence you should look for first is that which is near to hand.

### Theory to practice: 40 mins

#### **1. Practical exercise**

Remember, in your mentor meeting last week, you updated your claim using this matrix.

|                                                                                                 |                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deliberate The evidence you collected in a systematic, planned way for outcomes you anticipated | Overheard The evidence that fell into your lap, for example chance conversations with colleagues and pupils |
| Unexpected The evidence for outcomes you did not anticipate                                     | Counter The evidence, possibly negative, which sits at odds with your overall claim                         |

In making ‘reasonable inferences’ keep this in mind:
Know the detail of what you altered in your practice
Observe the changes in outcomes/ behaviours for your pupils
Is it fair to infer that the outcomes were caused by the alterations to practice?

Some things you might do to actively collect the wider evidence:

- interview briefly the pupils or colleagues you overheard
- analyse the data for the outcomes you were not anticipating, e.g. take in another set of books
- speak to/ look again at the work of the pupils who appear not to be progressing in the way you hoped

#### **2. Self-assessment**

Engaging in practitioner inquiry is a powerful form of professional development. It can have a direct impact upon your…

…Practical knowledge – the fluency with which you use your expanded repertoire
…Beliefs – in yourself and your pupils
…Workload – by learning to do less of what doesn’t (and more of what does) work
…Professional relationships – what you learn from each other

It is important to recognise the impacts that your inquiry has had on you. Where should you look?

- your Learning Log
- your Module 8 audit
- the ECF statements for the standard you have focused on (but look across the ECF too)
- your colleagues – what have they noticed about how you have developed?
- take another look at the featured case study teachers. What did they notice about their beliefs, workload and professional relationships?

#### **3. Rehearsal**

Next week your mentor is going to ask you about the impact your inquiry has had on you.

Spend a few minutes this week rehearsing what you are going to say to them.

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Bring your self-assessment of the impact upon you of your inquiry to your mentor meeting next week and be ready to discuss this with them.
In that meeting, you will also talk about how you will present your final inquiry findings. Come with your own ideas!
