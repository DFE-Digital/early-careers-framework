Throughout the module, there will be opportunities for you to reflect on your current practice and to consider ways you can enhance what you are already doing in the classroom.

## Introduction

The 2014 Sutton Trust report, ‘What Makes Great Teaching’, highlights the importance of effective classroom environments:

> A teacher’s abilities to make efficient use of lesson time, to coordinate classroom resources and space, and to manage students’ behaviour with clear rules that are consistently enforced, are all relevant to maximising the learning that can take place. These environmental factors are necessary for good learning…
>
> Coe et al, 2014, page 3

While all teachers would agree about the importance of a calm and purposeful teaching environment, there are often challenges and barriers to achieving this consistently with pupils. This module will explore what effective learning environments look like and strategies that you can use to achieve them.

So, what are effective learning environments? Essentially, they have to be built on the value of trust. Children need to know that they are trusted, and they're valued. They need to feel that the classrooms they're in are somewhere where they feel safe, looked after and respected. Now that doesn't mean having some kind of gushing synthetic form of over warmth. What it does mean is that children need to know what they need to do in classrooms and that involves teaching them, first of all, the norms of the classroom, being really explicit about what is normal behaviour in the classroom and in that way we show them high expectations, which is another way of showing them that we care about them because what it means is that we think they're capable of achieving these expectations. So, we must be super explicit about the norms of the room not just the rules, although that forms part of it, but what normal behaviour should look like in a classroom - don't make them guess it. In a room full of thirty children, you’ll have thirty different ideas about what normal good behaviour looks like, so teach them the norms.

If you want them to think that it's normal to work hard, then mention it constantly and demonstrate it by your actions. If you want them to think that it's normal to be kind or to share or to take turns or be compassionate with one another, then make that the norm too. Talk about it, demonstrate it and explain it. If you look at a good early years environment for example, dealing with the most young children, what we find is the children at that age know very little and must be instructed almost entirely to do the things which are normal for the room, which means lots of unpicking and unpacking and demonstrating what, for example, sharing and waiting your turn actually looks like. So that's norms and then we can develop that even more and say that a good learning environment needs to be built on routines.

Now, a routine is simply another version of a norm but a far more explicit version. What it tends to be is a set sequence of behaviours - do this, then do this, then do this. And again, the reason why children need to know what routines are is because they need to know what's expected of them in the classroom - don't make them guess it. You might know what you think good behaviour looks like but they don't know what you think good behaviour looks like, and perhaps 80% of the class might know absolutely well how to behave in your lessons but don't make them guess. The word ‘behave’ means lots of things to lots of different people.

And thirdly, the thing that really ties this together is that children need to know not just what's expected of them in order to behave, but also what will happen to them if they do or don't behave in the way that you expect of them. Now, traditionally in many classrooms that can involve some form of mild sanction to act as a deterrent or mild reward to act as an incentive, but of course your response to consequences can be much more complex than that. You might for instance just want to have a quiet word with them, you might want to call parents, you might want to say nothing or do nothing, you might want to try and unpick and unpack if there's any reasons why they're behaving that way, but the key thing here is that children need to feel that their actions matter, which means they have to have consequences, which means you have to notice it and that can mean lots and lots of different things.

If you have a whole school consequence system, what's terribly important is you use it as consistently as possible. This makes it fair and this makes it easier for children to understand. If you feel there's a reason why the children should be excepted from the consequence, then that's fine but the exception itself must be exceptional and it must be logical, and it must be consistent. If a child has got for example Tourette syndrome, then you might for example let them off the consequence for sweating, as long as the class understands what the situation is with the child and why they're being made an exception of.

So those three things: norms, routines and effective consistent consequences, are the structure, the scaffold, the skeleton upon which you build the classroom and what should infuse all of these three aspects is that the children need to feel valued. They need to feel like they matter. They need to feel like what they do matters in the classroom because, once children feel like they matter in the classroom, then they start to relax. They start to realize that they should conform to the norms and the routines and listen to the consequences of the classroom. If they don't feel like they matter, then they won't, and again I stress this doesn't mean by gushing or over praising children. It could be something as simple as saying to them ‘I value you all, I value your education, I want you to be safe, happy and I want you to flourish. In order for that to happen, we're all going to have to follow certain rules, consistencies and norms.’ That's the type of message you want to communicate to children and the beauty of that is you can do it in your own personality and with your own style. If your natural instinct is to be warm and friendly with children, by all means be warm and friendly with children, as long as they know that there are boundaries. Children crave boundaries and they also hate boundaries and that tension, which sounds like a paradox, is perhaps at the heart of what it means to be a human, and particularly what it means to be a growing human, and particularly what it means to be an adult or a teacher in charge of that flourishing.

## Introduction

In this module you will explore the findings and evidence gathered during studies of how pupils learn, and the related implications for teaching.

You will hear from Deans for Impact, an American not-for-profit organisation set up with the aim of improving teacher education. A summary of their work on How Pupils Learn can be found in the publication [‘The Science of Learning’](https://deansforimpact.org/resources/the-science-of-learning/), which will be referenced throughout the module.

You will explore the importance of memory in learning; how to build and sequence your pupils’ long-term memory into organised mental models to support learning, and how to avoid overwhelming pupils when introducing new concepts and knowledge.

While engaging with this online content, you will also prepare for discussions with your mentor and training sessions led by your school.

## What makes effective classroom practice?

Effective classroom practice is made up of many components. It’s partly what makes teaching so challenging – there are many components to consider at one given time during a lesson and they are all inextricably linked and intertwined.

Hi everyone, and welcome to the module which really is about the nuts and bolts of planning what we do in our classrooms, day-in day-out. As Mark Enser says, ‘teaching is, at its heart, simple’.

There are many things that may on the surface seem simple and straightforward and that you need to know and practice as a novice teacher. We'll take you through them in this module. These elements of lessons may seem simple but doing these seemingly simple, straightforward things well is complex. But that's part of the intellectual joy and challenge of being a teacher.

Teaching has explored in the module how do pupils learn is joyful in its complexity and challenge. Our profession is one of intellectual intricacy underpinned by what can look stunningly simple, but to master these elements of teaching takes practice, questioning and dollops more practice. As novice teachers, and indeed as any teacher, we can't think of the nuts and bolts of lessons as separates of the curriculum. It's impossible. They're inextricably linked and the subject that we teach has to be prioritised. We need to continually read around the subject. We shouldn't get hung up on divvying up our lessons into specific little chunks of time because, as Stewart Locke says, ‘it's not really possible to talk about how to teach something independently of what it is you are teaching’. When you're planning a lesson, start with what do you want the children to learn, know, understand. What's the best way of them learning that? Even if I talked about English lessons, that's quite generic. Do I mean English language or literature or linguistics? There are so many variables and complexities.

When I'm planning lessons on Macbeth, for example, I'm probably going to teach those lessons differently to how I teach first world war poetry. So when planning lessons, think of it as holding hands with the curriculum and then guiding that curriculum by the hand into your classroom. One simply cannot exist without the other.

Whilst we’ll take you through different composite elements of lessons this isn't to suggests that these different elements should be present every lesson. You, with guidance from your mentor, will decide how long it will take for your pupils to meet an objective or less than question. In doing so you will have all these ingredients present, but they might not fit neatly into one lesson but rather over a series of lessons. You may well knit between each of them they don't have to necessarily follow a linear path. Questioning and checking for understanding for example is likely to be present frequently at different points throughout lessons. And again, thinking this through with the subject you're teaching in mind, is all part of what makes our profession a jubilant intellectual challenge in its oxymoronic simplicity and complexity.

As Claire Stoneman mentions, teaching is intellectually challenging, and complex but effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning. Therefore, it is important that you are reflective and continually seek to develop and enhance your teaching.

## Principles of Instruction

> ‘You haven’t taught if pupils haven’t learnt.’

This is one of Zig Engelmann’s more famous quotes which highlights that the goal of teaching is to support pupils to learn and build their mental models over time. Research shows that quality of instruction is one of the most significant factors in facilitating this (Coe, 2014). Instruction includes many elements of classroom practice such as reviewing previous learning, progressively introducing new learning using modelling and scaffolds, questioning and assessing learning, and providing pupils with adequate practice time to securely embed it.

As instruction is made up of so many components that happen interchangeably throughout learning, it can be very challenging to do well. In addition, as you will have explored in module two, there are cognitive limitations that can interfere with learning such as having a limited working memory and experiencing working memory overload. Therefore, it is vital that your instruction is structured in a way that supports pupils to understand and learn new material.

Many of the features included throughout this module stem from the enlightening, research-informed work of Barak Rosenshine’s Principles of Instruction. He explored the research base for features of good teaching and outlined 10 principles that form part of effective instruction. If you are unfamiliar with this research; it would be worth finding time to read through his[ Principles of Instruction](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Rosenshine.pdf) as it underpins good teaching practice and much of the content within this module.

The features of effective teaching that this module aims to explore are:

- Review of previous learning
- Teaching information and modelling processes in small steps, allowing for practice after each step
- Checking for understanding at every stage of learning
- Scaffolding practice to enable learners to gradually become more independent as they begin to build and strengthen their mental models.

These elements are part of an iterative process that should be continuous throughout instruction in response to the pupils’ learning.

This module will support you to structure your teaching in a way that will enhance pupil learning.

The components of classroom practice that you will explore have been broken down into sections. You can explore each feature separately, but it is important to note they are not a checklist to be included in every lesson in a specific order. They are interdependent and should be used interchangeably throughout a lesson where appropriate.

Sometimes certain features may not be present at all during a lesson. It will depend on the learning focus you have set and the sequence of lessons that it is placed within.

## The importance and challenge of supporting every pupil to succeed

As a teacher, you will want to support* all* pupils to achieve success in your class. This can be very challenging at times as every pupil comes to the classroom with different life experiences, prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, all of which can impact on how they engage during lessons and, subsequently, what they learn.

$Content
You will probably have heard the phrase ‘every teacher is a teacher of SEND’, but what does this actually mean?

Well the SEND Code of Practice makes the following statements:

Teachers are responsible and accountable for the progress and development of the pupils in their class, including where pupils access support from teaching assistants or specialist staff.

High quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN. Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching.

Knowing that the phrase stems from SEND legislation doesn’t make it any more meaningful. To me, what it means, is that in your classroom – whatever classroom that is; Early Years, primary, secondary, PE with Year Three first thing on Monday or Science with Year 11 last thing on Friday – you are likely to have learners in your class with an identified special educational need and they deserve access to your expertise and teaching as much as the next learner. This module will support you in teaching this cohort, and I’ll tell you more about that in a moment. But first, let’s look at the prevalence of SEND in a little more detail.

Now the proportion of school-aged children with an identified special educational need or disability changes each year, but there are some broad trends that you should be aware of. Over the past ten years, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of learners recorded as having SEND. In particular, there was a significant drop around 2015 when the Code of Practice was introduced and some of the definitions changed. Over the past few years though, numbers have been more or less stable, if anything rising slightly.

That is for all SEND, but there are two categories that learners with SEND will fall into: those learners who have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP), and those who receive SEN Support. The latter group – those on SEN Support - is significantly bigger than the EHCP group.

An important thing for you to know, is that eight out of ten pupils with an identified SEND, that’s those with an EHCP <em>and</em> those receiving SEN support, are in mainstream schools. They are not in special schools, they are in regular primary and secondary schools, and you will be teaching them. Every teacher is a teacher of SEND!

This module will give you more detail on some of the things I have mentioned like EHCPs and the Code of Practice. More importantly though, it will help you work through the practicalities of ‘every teacher being a teacher of SEND. You will learn that pupils are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed, and that seeking to understand these differences is an essential part of teaching, and in many cases, working with others is an important part of this process. You will also learn that maintaining high expectations for all pupils is critical to ensure that children meet their potential. In summary, you will learn, to be a teacher of SEND.

## Introduction

As a new teacher, now is a great time to begin practising your curriculum design skills. As you become a more experienced teacher, and especially if you choose to move into middle or senior leadership, you may find yourself designing the curriculum for a whole year, key stage, or even for a child’s entire school life.

The curriculum design skills that you’ll develop during this module can equally be applied to any future curriculum design you embark upon, no matter what the scope. What you’re learning now will therefore be of great value to you throughout your teaching career.

This module brings together many of the things you have learnt in previous modules this year. It is designed to revisit and draw upon your existing knowledge and apply this to think about what makes good curriculum design.

It is not intended to provide a step-by-step instruction guide or recipe to producing a scheme of work. First, curriculum design is rarely a linear process and you should expect to go backwards and forwards as your scheme develops. Second, schemes of work can take many forms and there is not a blueprint for a scheme of learning that will suit all contexts. So, use the principles outlined in this module as a guide and remember that any scheme of work should be a supportive framework for responsive teaching and learning, rather than a bind that restricts your teaching, or the learning of your pupils.

Throughout the module, you’ll hear from two teachers who will talk through the how they have approached the design of a scheme of work.

Primary and Secondary teachers will hear from Emily, Humanities lead at Reach Academy Feltham as she talks you through her scheme of work on tectonic plates.

Early Years teachers will hear from Maria, a teacher at One Degree Academy as she talks you through her scheme of work on learning the alphabet.

At your weekly mentor interactions, you’ll have time to share, discuss, and get feedback as your own scheme of work evolves.

    content: <<~MultilineString
This session will take **approximately 51 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Establishing and reinforcing routines can help to create an effective learning environment.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- What routines are and why they are important

- Common classroom routines:

  - Greeting pupils at the door and settling task
  - Transitioning to and from the carpet
  - Getting pupils’ attention
  - Exit routines

- How to plan and teach a routine

## What are routines and why are they important?

Classroom routines are procedures that are well established to ensure pupils complete tasks or transitions in an appropriate and time-efficient way.

### Why are routines important?

Routines reduce pupil distractions, make the classroom environment predictable and secure, and reduce the possibility for misbehaviour. A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs. Ultimately, creating and implementing routines in line with your school ethos saves time – and this means that pupils can spend more time focusing on what matters most: their learning.

In addition, research shows that routines are important for developing pupils' emotional self-regulation - the ability to control your emotions. It is important to develop this because if pupils can control their emotional response, they are better able to concentrate and learn in the classroom, which affects success in school and future lives.

Pupils become more able to regulate emotions, such as boredom or frustration, by relying on classroom rules and routines that help them to redirect their attention and minimise stress (Ursache, Blair & Raver, 2012). Therefore, it is important that you invest time in establishing and reinforcing routines to create an effective learning environment.

$CTA

## Greeting pupils at the door

From the moment pupils arrive at your classroom door to the time you begin teaching, there is an opportunity to clearly set expectations and build relationships with pupils in your classroom.

One way to do this is to greet pupils at the door as they arrive. By meeting your pupils at the door as they enter your classroom, you can build relationships with your pupils, positively reinforce behavioural expectations and create a warm environment before the lesson even begins. By being welcoming, friendly, and setting up a predictable start to the lesson, you will begin to develop a trusting relationship with your pupils.

$I

<h3>What makes it successful?</h3>
Exactly how you set up this routine may vary depending on the age of your pupils
or your school’s policies, but here are some good steps you can take to make it successful

<strong>
  Step 1: Stand at or around the door or entrance to the classroom. 
</strong>

This will enable you to:

<ul>
  <li>monitor pupils’ moods and behaviours as they enter the classroom</li>
  <li>
    see both inside the classroom and out onto the corridor or playground.
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  Step 2: Positively interact with pupils as they come into the class to help
  build trust and respect.
</strong>

This could be:

<ul>
  <li>
    Greeting pupils by saying, “Good Morning”, to make your pupils feel welcome
  </li>
  <li>
    Asking a relationship building question like, “How did the football match
    go?”
  </li>
  <li>Simply giving a non-verbal positive interaction like a warm smile.</li>
  <li>
    Provide positive reinforcement to pupils who are meeting your expectations,
    for example, “Thank you Mohammed for remembering to put your homework in the
    box”
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>
  Step 3: If necessary, provide corrective statements to individual pupils or
  the entire class to reinforce your expectations.
</strong>

For example, you might:

<ul>
  <li>
    Remind children of the behaviour you want to see in a respectful way, for
    example, “Remember, we should have our shirts tucked so we’re looking
    smart”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a positive frame such as, “I’m looking forward to seeing you concentrate
    really hard today”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid negative comments like, “I don’t want you getting distracted again
    like you did last lesson”. This is a new lesson for you and your pupils, so
    start with a clean slate.
  </li>
</ul>
$I

If you also greet parents at the door, for example in Early Years or KS1, this is a great opportunity to build relationships with them too. Sharing a quick comment about how well their child did yesterday at a task or activity, or the progress they are making in a subject, will support you to build positive relationships with the families of your pupils. This is turn can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.

## Settling task

Another routine you may wish to think about adopting at the start of the school year is introducing a settling task.

A settling task is a short task that pupils can complete the beginning of each lesson without any direct instruction from you.
This type of task ensures pupils are focused on learning from the moment they enter your classroom, helping to create an effective learning environment.

By providing a settling task, you reduce the opportunities for low level disruption such as talking or loitering. It also has the added bonus of affording you time to greet the pupils at the door, knowing everyone has a task to be getting on with while you do this.

$I

<h3>What makes this successful?</h3>
Here are some ways you can make a settling task successful:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No direct instruction required</strong> – pupils should be able to
    see the activity and complete it immediately without asking for help from
    you or their peers. For younger pupils who can’t read directions or
    instructions, it might be helpful to model the task the day before or use a
    task they are already familiar with so when they enter, they can start the
    task without requiring too much instruction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Observable</strong> – if you are in KS2 or above, the settling task
    works best if it involves some writing to make it more rigorous and engaging
    – and so you can see they’re completing it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>5 minutes or less</strong> – this is a short task to begin the
    lesson or the day so it shouldn’t take any longer than 5 minutes to
    complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Review or preview</strong> – the task should be based on a review of
    learning from a previous lesson or a preview of the lesson that is about to
    begin.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Feedback</strong> – briefly review and feedback on the answers –
    ideally taking no more than 5 minutes. This may mean prioritising which
    parts of the activity to review with the whole class that will be highest
    leverage for your pupils.
  </li>
</ul>
$I

<h3>Greeting pupils at the door and settling task in action</h3>
Choose the video that’s most suitable for you. While watching, think about the following
questions:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      What is the impact of these routines on pupils’ behaviour and learning at
      the start of the lesson?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do these routines meet the success criteria?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is there anything that would make the routine even better?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

Here’s a reminder of the success criteria:

#### Greeting Pupils at the door

- Step 1: Stand at or around the door or entrance to the classroom
- Step 2: Positively interact with pupils as they come into the class
- Step 3: If necessary, provide pre-corrective statements to individual pupils or the entire class.

    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>

## Transitioning to and from the carpet

Transitioning between the carpet to tables or independent tasks is an activity that happens frequently in a Primary classroom – especially those in Early Years and Key Stage 1. Therefore, it is one routine that you could prioritise at the beginning of the school year to ensure it is well established and efficient.

$I

<h3>What makes this routine successful?</h3>
When creating a routine for this, as with any other routine, it is helpful to ensure
instructions are clear and concise, so pupils know what is expected of them. It is
therefore useful if instructions are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Specific and observable</strong> – they make the behaviours pupils
    are expected to exhibit explicit. This also makes it easy to observe whether
    pupils are doing them or not. For example, “Stand behind your chairs”,
    rather than, “Be ready”.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sequential</strong> – they are given in the order that you want
    pupils to follow them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manageable</strong> – use fewer words to make the instruction easier
    for pupils to process and remember. You can replace words with numbers or
    gestures to make them even quicker to deliver.
  </li>
</ul>

## Getting pupils’ attention

Getting pupils’ attention is a key skill for any teacher to master but can be very tricky to do effectively every time. Creating and explicitly teaching routines that reinforce your expectations about pupils’ attention can really support this.

There are numerous strategies you can use to get pupils’ attention - clapping a pattern, counting down, using an instrument, putting your hand in the air, and so on. Whichever strategy you use, it’s important that you use consistent language or non-verbal signals to support pupils’ understanding of what you are expecting them to do.

<h3>What makes this routine successful?</h3>
When creating a routine for this, as with any other routine, it is important that
you are clear on what you want pupils to do. It is therefore useful if instructions
are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Specific and observable</strong> – they make the behaviours that
    pupils are expected to exhibit explicit. This also makes it easy to observe
    whether pupils are doing them or not. For example, saying, “Pencils down and
    eyes to me”, is observable. Conversely, saying, “Pay attention”, is vague
    and abstract.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sequential</strong> – they are given in the order that you want
    pupils to follow them. For example, “Put your pens down, close your books,
    and eyes on me”.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manageable</strong> – use fewer words to make the instruction easier
    for pupils to process and remember. You can replace words with numbers or
    gestures to make them even quicker to deliver.

## Exit routine

You should hold and maintain high expectations of your pupils from the moment they enter your classroom to the moment they leave, which includes how they exit your classroom.

Once a lesson has ended, it can be tempting to encourage pupils to leave as quickly as possible to give you time to prepare for your next lesson. But this can cause a rowdy exit and may also leave you with a messy classroom that you have to tidy up - something you probably don’t have time for. For these reasons, it’s a good idea to leave time at the end of each lesson for an efficient exit routine.

<h3>What makes an exit routine successful?</h3>
This might depend on your school’s expectations and ethos, but it is helpful if:
<ul>
  <li>Tables and learning spaces are tidy</li>
  <li>Chairs are pushed under</li>
  <li>Pupils leave the classroom in an orderly fashion</li>
</ul>
When creating a routine for this, as with any other routine, it is important that
you are clear on what you want pupils to do. It is therefore useful if instructions

  <li>
    <strong>Specific and observable</strong> – they make the behaviours that
    pupils are expected to exhibit explicit. This also makes it easy to observe

    behind your chair”, is observable. Conversely, saying, “Get ready to leave”,
    is vague and abstract.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sequential</strong> – they are given in the order that you want
    pupils to follow them. For example, “Pass your books to the end of your row
    and pack your belongings away in your bag”.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manageable</strong> – use fewer words to make the instruction easier
    for pupils to process and remember. You can replace words with numbers or

## The importance of teaching and practising

Effective routines take time to teach and fully establish. It can feel daunting to do this and you may feel a pressure to move onto teaching the curriculum as soon as possible. However, time spent setting up efficient classroom routines pays dividends in the long term, as the incremental minutes saved each lesson by efficient routines adds up to lots of extra learning time across the year.

Here Tom Bennett explains why explicitly teaching and practicing routines is so important. Whilst watching, consider the following questions.

- **Why is it important to explicitly teach routines?**
- **What are the five tips that Tom outlines for when teaching behavioural expectations and routines?**

Why is it important to explicitly teach and practice routines? – Tom Bennett

## How to teach effective routines

Time is one of the most important resources you have as a teacher and so it’s important you do what you can to conserve it. Routines can help with this by enabling pupils to complete a task in the quickest, simplest way that requires you to give only a few, brief instructions. The following suggestions will support you when planning and teaching your routines.

1. **Be clear on what you want pupils to do**
   When creating any routine, it is important that you are clear on what you want pupils to do. It is therefore useful if you plan your instructions in advance and ensure that they are:

   - **Specific and observable** – they make the behaviours pupils are expected to exhibit explicit. This also makes it easy to observe whether pupils are doing them or not. For example, saying, “Pencils down and eyes to me” is specific and observable whereas saying, “Pay attention” is vague and abstract.
   - **Sequential** – they are given in the order that you want pupils to follow them. For example, “Put your pens down, close your books, and eyes on me”.
   - **Manageable** – use fewer words to make the instruction easier for pupils to process and remember. You can replace words with numbers or gestures to make them even quicker to deliver.

2. **Teach and model your routine in small steps**

   - Teaching a routine in small steps helps to make it manageable and memorable for pupils. When teaching each step, make your behavioural expectations explicit by modelling the step as you describe it. This helps to build pupils’ mental model of the routine and makes it more likely they will achieve success.

3. **Practise your routine at the beginning of the school year until pupils meet your expectations**

   - Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and feedback, increases the chances of them being successful when completing the routine. Frame guidance and feedback positively to motivate pupils to do better next time.

$CTA
Note that while pupils may master routines after lots of practise at the start of the year, over time you may notice some routines slipping a little. Demonstrate the high expectations you have of your pupils by positively reinforcing your routines and practising them again if necessary. This is the key to maintaining high quality, efficient routines.

## Planning your routine

During your next mentor meeting, classroom routines will be observed. Take some time to consider which routines you could establish or improve to enhance learning time in your classroom. Some routines you may wish to consider improving or establishing are listed below in order of highest leverage for pupil learning:

- Greeting pupils at the door and settling task
- Getting pupils’ attention
- Transitioning to and from the carpet
- Exit Routine

You may wish to discuss which one would be highest leverage for you to establish or improve with your mentor. Once you have decided upon a routine, plan how you will teach it in detail and script what you will say. It is helpful to remember to:

- Be clear on what you want pupils to do

- Ensure your instructions are:

  - Specific and observable
  - Sequential
  - Manageable

- Plan to teach and model your routine in small steps

- Plan to practise your routine

This session will take **approximately 30 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

It’s important to create a culture of trust and respect within your classroom that supports all pupils to succeed.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Motivation
- Praise
- Building trust and respect

## Motivation

Pupils are motivated by extrinsic factors (related to rewards) and intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values).

### Extrinsic factors

Extrinsic factors are external motivators such as rewards and punishments. Therefore, an extrinsically motivated pupil is likely to persist at a challenging task because they want to receive a reward such as a house point, sticker, or praise, or they want to avoid punishment, like a detention or extra homework.

### Intrinsic factors

Intrinsic factors are internal motivators which relate to an individual’s identity and values. As a teacher, you are a key role model, who can influence the attitudes, values and consequently, behaviours of your pupils. For example, you might emphasise the value of persevering in the face of adversity because in order to improve at something, you must practise areas that you find challenging. Therefore, an intrinsically motivated pupil is likely to persist at a challenging task because they know you need to practise to improve as a result of the values you have been promoting.

As teachers, our long-term aim is to help our pupils move from needing extrinsic motivation to being intrinsically motivated to work and learn.
Both types of motivation will be further explored throughout the programme.

To begin with, you will explore how to motivate pupils using one type of extrinsic factors: praise.

## Praise

As a teacher, we can demonstrate our consistently high expectations by acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising the progress pupils are making. This can help to communicate shared values that improve both the classroom and school culture.

Within the classroom, we can use praise to positively reinforce expectations by recognising pupils’ hard work and effort, sharing and celebrate their work or behaviour, and indirectly preventing low-level disruption.

Outside of the classroom, pupil praise can be a positive way to engage parents and careers in their child’s education by proactively highlighting their efforts and successes.

Whether used within or outside of the classroom, praise can be incredibly motivating for pupils.

## The difference between acknowledgement and praise

Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made is a great way to extrinsically motivate pupils. Research also suggests that praise can help to build pupils’ intrinsic motivation too (Henderlong & Lepper, 2002).

Sometimes it can be tempting to praise pupils for every correct decision they make in the classroom – from entering quietly to picking up their pens to completing a task you set them. However, overusing praise can make it seem disingenuous to pupils, thereby causing it to lose power and effect.

To avoid overuse, it can be helpful to keep in mind the difference between acknowledgement and praise.

Acknowledgement is when you recognise or thank a pupil for meeting your expectations. You may use acknowledgement when a pupil follows your instructions or carries out the routines you have set to the standard that you expect. For example, “Thanks Suzy for lining up silently”, or, “I can see 80% of us are ready to start”.

This is different from praising a pupil for following your expectations – for example, “Well done to Suzy for lining up silently – that’s fantastic”. It’s not a good idea to praise in this way, because it sends out an implicit message that you are in some way impressed that Suzy has met your expectations and didn’t expect her to.

It’s best to reserve praise and words like ‘fantastic’, ‘brilliant’ and ‘great’ to emphasise pupil effort and progress being made. For example, when a pupil has worked hard in class and made good progress, you might say, “Mohammed has used a fronted adverbial and included the right punctuation – fantastic work Mohammed!”.

## Precise praise

When giving praise, you should aim to be specific so that pupils know what they did well. If you don’t inform them of how they demonstrated effort and determination or highlight the progress they have made, then they won’t know what to repeat in future. Therefore, praise should be precise.

Here are some examples of using precise praise:

- **Praising independence**
  “Great effort. You used the resources to complete that question without asking for help.

- **Praising one-to-one correspondence in counting**
  “Well done – you counted each object once this time.”

- **Praising passing a ball correctly in rugby**
  “That’s much better. You passed backwards every time – brilliant work.”

### Precise praise in action

Watch a video of a teacher using precise praise.

As you watch, notice how the teacher uses both acknowledgement (to highlight when their expectations have been met) and precise praise (to highlight pupil effort or progress)

<h3>Reflection</h3>
In you next mentor session, your mentor will observe you using precise praise and
acknowledgement. To help you prepare, reflect on your current teaching practice and
consider:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>How do you currently acknowledge or praise pupils?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How could you improve this to make it more effective and meaningful for
      pupils?
    </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

### Engaging parents and carers

Engaging parents or carers in their child's education by sharing successes or achievements with them is another way to extrinsically motivate pupils.

It can also help to build relationships with carers and families which can further improve pupil's motivation, behaviour and academic success.

There are many ways of doing this and often schools have their own policies on engaging with parents and carers, so speak with your mentor to explore the approaches you could take

## Building trust and respect

Creating a calm and respectful classroom environment is a bedrock on which you can build positive relationships with your pupils.

Research shows that teachers developing trusting relationships with pupils is critical for pupils’ enjoyment of school and for their academic progress. For example, [a 2015 PISA study](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/do-teacher-student-relations-affect-students-well-being-at-school_5js391zxjjf1-en;jsessionid=Tle2wVAsHg1cYXJtlp08_K89.ip-10-240-5-189) found that teacher-pupil relations are strongly associated with both performance in mathematics as well as pupils’ happiness and sense of belonging at school.

Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood. Listen to Bea Stevenson talk here about the roll that respect and empathy play in this process and consider the following questions:

- Why is your own self-awareness important?
- How are feelings linked to behaviour?
- How can you help pupils to self-regulate their emotions and consequently, their behaviour?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It's a grey, Wednesday morning in November. You have left the house in a
  hurry, forgetting your keys- and snapped at your mum on the phone on the way
  in to work. You arrive at school later than you had wanted to, with less time
  to prepare for the day ahead than you had hoped for. In a short time, your
  class will be arriving. A class of young people that, if you are honest with
  yourself, you have not yet been able to build the relationships with that you
  know are so important. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  So how can you, with everything you are managing in your own life, create a
  classroom climate that builds trust and respect and that supports all pupils
  to thrive? 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Firstly, we will think about YOU. What you are dealing with in your own life
  and how you manage the feelings associated with the ups and downs - your{" "}
</span>
<b>self-awareness</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, we will consider how </span>
<b>feelings drive behaviours</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  and how our ability to respond empathically to those around you will support
  you, as teacher, to build responsive relationships with pupils.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, we will explore how </span>
<b>high expectations</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  can be maintained through a finely tuned balance of{" "}
</span>
<b>empathy with clear boundaries.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  So let’s return to that grizzly Wednesday morning. It’s so important to check
  in with your own emotional state on a regular basis: where would you place
  yourself on this emotional thermometer at that point in the day? (
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">show ET board</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">). We come to our first point- that </span>
<b>your self-awareness is key</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  . Recognising your own emotions – whether it’s anger, excitement, frustration
  or something else- and accepting that you can both be aware of the emotion
  whilst also being able to ‘park it’, to return to it later, is a key part of
  being the strong role model that young people need in their lives. As
  professionals we need to find ways to be aware of, but put to one side,
  (possibly to manage later) our own emotions - so that we can enable and
  support young people and build a culture of trust and respect.  
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  To do this, you can create times in the day to ‘check in’ with how you are
  feeling, for example, whilst walking down the corridor, listening to music, or
  having a cup of tea with a colleague.  If you can create this space- just a
  few moments- then you provide yourself with time to understand your own
  feelings and emotions. This is important because as the orchestrator of the
  classroom climate, in Haim Ginott’s words, it’s your daily mood that makes the
  weather. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This leads to our second point that these feelings you are checking in with on
  a regular basis, are driving behaviours - both yours and those of your pupils.
  Behaviour is  often a  way  of  communicating  feelings, for example, a child
  who is shouting out may be feeling overwhelmed and therefore finding it
  difficult to manage his or her frustration, or a child who shouted at another
  pupil during play time may have been feeling jealous and angry because they
  felt left out. It is important that we recognise and accept all feelings,
  whilst also setting fair, clear boundaries about behaviour.  Discussing your
  emotions and the emotions of pupils is helpful in these circumstances as it
  helps to expand pupils’ feelings vocabulary. Once they begin to recognise
  their feelings, you can support pupils to find other tools to deal with
  situations they find difficult. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  One way we can encourage pupils to respect and support one another is with a
  class or group agreement that you can then return to on a regular basis.
  Including young people early on in identifying how they want to FEEL in class,
  and in relation to others around them, helps them think about how they best
  learn. They may come up with words such as ‘safe’, ‘happy’ ‘energised’,
  ‘listened to’ and ‘valued’. Then think about the behaviours that are and
  aren’t helpful for the class to feel these ways. This conversation encourages
  ownership and a sense of agency for all young people- it means they are
  invested in the classroom being a place THEY want to be and to learn. It also
  gives the important and ongoing message that you as teacher are listening to
  them, that it matters how they are feeling and what they need. This is
  important because building effective relationships is easier when pupils are
  aware that their feelings are considered and understood. You can return to
  this agreement on a daily basis - both as a proactive way to encourage the
  behaviour you want to see and also as a reminder to young people when they
  aren’t displaying the behaviour that is helpful to them or others. Remind them
  gently ‘do you remember we said we all wanted to feel safe’, - I wonder if
  this is helping others feel safe, or listened to? What do we need to do to
  help everyone feel this way?’  This will support their own ability to
  recognise what they need in order to learn, through an understanding of their
  own feelings and drivers of their behaviour and therefore support them to
  self-regulate their emotions in the long term. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The final way to create a culture of respect and mutual trust is to maintain
  high expectations of pupils through a finely tuned balance of empathy with
  fair, clear boundaries.
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Empathy, unlike sympathy, is the ability to think about how another person
  might be feeling and to see a situation from their point of view. So we can
  tentatively suggest what might be going on for a child when they are throwing,
  or pushing, or shouting, or of course the less disruptive behaviours such as
  being withdrawn. It is important you maintain your expectations about
  appropriate behaviours but attempt to discover the drive for these behaviours
  in a respectful way such as ‘I’m wondering if you are feeling….’ ‘you seem…..’
  . Our instinct sometimes is to try and solve things for the young people we
  work with rather than help them to deal with the potentially complicated
  feelings. It is important to understand that the way we hold high expectations
  of behaviour is not through methods that might shame or humiliate the children
  in our classes but in how we help pupils to change their behaviour.
</span>

  So, how do you create a culture of mutual trust and respect that supports all
  pupils to thrive? First, make sure you are thinking about YOUR self-awareness-
  as the role model- the young people in your class are learning about
  relationships in their every interaction with you and with the interactions
  they see you having with others. Second, remember that behaviour can be driven
  by feelings: support young people to recognise and name these feelings, as
  well as find appropriate ways to manage them. Third, it is absolutely possible
  to have high expectations of yourself and young people - setting clear
  boundaries whilst also responding with empathy and understanding. Finally and
  most important, an empathy-based classroom pivots on you, the teacher, being
  able to be a responsive adult for young people, and in order to be that person
  it is crucial that you look after yourself.

This session will take **approximately 40 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

You can affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of your pupils. When behaviour incidents occur, no matter how small or large, it’s important that you respond consistently in the least intrusive ways which align with your school’s behaviour policy or approach.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- What is low-level disruption?
- Using early and least intrusive interventions as an initial response

## What is low-level disruption?

When teaching a carefully planned and well-resourced lesson, you may expect pupils to remain focused and engaged throughout - and some pupils will. However, some pupils may require prompts to keep them focused on their learning.

Sometimes, a pupil’s attention may drift unintentionally, and they may begin to exhibit low-level disruption. On other occasions, pupils may deliberately exhibit such behaviours to avoid engaging with work.

Whatever the reason is for a disruption, it’s important to address it as early as possible to prevent it from escalating and impacting further on pupils’ learning.

Low-level disruption can be anything that disrupts the flow of your lesson. Some examples include pen tapping, chatting, calling out, entering late, chewing gum, playing with resources and swinging on chairs.

In isolation, low-level disruption can seem harmless. But when it occurs frequently, it can become increasingly difficult to manage and this inevitably impacts on pupils’ learning.

In session 1, we looked at how to prevent low-level behaviour by creating and reinforcing routines, and in session 2 by positively reinforcing behaviour with acknowledgment and praise. Here we will look at how to address low-level disruption once it has occurred.

In response to low-level disruption, one approach we can take is to use the Least Invasive Intervention (Lemov, 2015). Lemov argues that by minimising the ‘drama’ you can correct off-task pupils without interrupting the learning. In contrast, if you confront pupils too publicly, you may escalate a situation unnecessarily, and make a pupil feel embarrassed or shamed. This makes the situation worse for both you and the pupil – and is more likely to derail the learning of this pupil and others.

Lemov identifies six subtle techniques that a teacher can use to quickly address low-level disruption, which you will explore throughout this session. These techniques are listed below in order, with the least intrusive method at the top:

1. Non-verbal Intervention
2. Positive Group Correction
3. Anonymous Individual Correction
4. Private Individual Correction
5. Lightning-quick Public Correction
6. Private Individual Praise

In the classroom, you may choose to address low-level disruption by employing the least invasive technique first (non-verbal intervention) and work your way down the techniques if the previous one doesn’t work. However, there may be some occasions where you choose the method you feel is most appropriate to the context and the behaviour being exhibited at the time.

## Non-verbal Intervention

'Non-verbal Intervention’ is when you use gestures or your proximity to a pupil to mitigate low-level disruption in a non-invasive way.

The advantage of this technique is that the teaching does not stop while the disruption is being addressed, so the flow of the lesson is not interrupted in any way. It is also a respectful way to refocus pupils because it gives them an opportunity to self-regulate their behaviour without being shamed or embarrassed in front of their peers.

$I

<h3>Example 1 – Using proximity</h3>
If a pupil is fiddling with their pen or whiteboard during a phonics lesson, you
might use a downward hand gesture to signal to the child to put their pen down whilst
the rest of the pupils continue to read sounds that you point to on the board. $I

$I

<h3>Example 2 - Using gestures</h3>
If you notice a pupil no longer following the text during whole class reading, you
might walk closer to where they are sitting whilst continuing to read, to prompt
them to follow the text. Here, you’re using your own proximity to the pupil to redirect
their attention, without needing to say any words. Other pupils are unlikely to even
be aware that you are intervening.

These are great ways to refocus off-task pupils without stopping teaching. However, such interventions can become invasive if not performed correctly.
$I

$I

<h3>Non-example</h3>A pupil is fiddling with their pen or whiteboard during a phonics
lesson, so you use a downward hand gesture to signal to the child to put their pen
down and <em>wait</em>, looking at them intently with a frown on your face until
they do. $I

In the non-example above, the teacher stops teaching. Therefore, the rest of the class has stopped learning and are now watching the non-verbal communication between the teacher and the off-task pupil. This may embarrass the pupil and causes lost learning time. Always aim to use non-verbal interventions discretely whilst continuing to teach your lesson.

**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**

If the pupil still hasn’t refocused after you have used a non-verbal intervention, then you may need to employ the next technique: positive group correction.

## Positive Group Correction

‘Positive Group Correction’ is a quick verbal reminder addressed to the whole class.

**Why address the whole group rather than individuals?**

There are two reasons for this:

1. Saying the names of pupils who are not complying with your instructions may cause embarrassment or escalate the behaviour to a confrontation that further disrupts the lesson.
2. In addressing the whole class, you may prompt others to check their behaviour who may also be off task - but you hadn’t noticed.

This intervention is best framed in a positive way – by describing the solution rather than the problem. For example, ‘Everybody should have their pens down and eyes to me’. The correction needs to be short and direct so as not to disrupt the flow of the lesson.

If you want to increase accountability of individual pupils, you could non-verbally indicate to a specific pupil whilst still speaking to the whole class.

**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**

If the pupil still hasn’t refocused after using positive group correction, then you may need to employ the next technique: Anonymous Individual Correction.

## Anonymous Individual Correction

‘Anonymous Individual Correction’ is similar to the positive group correction in that it is anonymous, and solution focused. However, it additionally informs the class that there are some pupils who are non-compliant. For example, “Eyes on me. I am still waiting for two more pupils”.

Anonymity reduces the level of disruption caused, as it prevents pupils from being tempted to turn and face the individual being addressed. It addresses the behaviour in a respectful way, helping to maintain an environment of mutual trust and respect.

This technique also gives pupils more ownership over their behaviour as they identify for themselves that they are one of the pupils who isn’t ready. This has the added benefit of encouraging independence and self-regulation.

**What happens if the pupil does not correct their behaviour?**

If the pupil still hasn’t refocused after using positive group correction, then you may need to employ the next technique: Private Individual Correction.

## Private Individual Correction

‘Private Individual Correction’ is when you address a pupil’s behaviour discreetly whilst the rest of the class are working independently or with peers.

### **What happens if the behaviour occurs during whole-class teaching?**

If you notice a pupil is off task whilst you are addressing the whole class, you might give the class a quick task to complete.

For example: “Turn to your partner and tell them what you know about _insert topic being covered_”.

Whilst they are doing this, you can approach the pupil, crouch down next to them, and quietly address the behaviour.

For example: “Sunita, it’s important that you understand this method of subtraction. It will help you work independently later. Make sure your eyes are on the board, thank you.”

### **Why is this effective?**

- It describes the solution (“Eyes on the board”).
- It emphasises the purpose to the learner (“It will help you work independently”)
- It is done respectfully and privately, rather than in front of the rest of the class.

These features help to create a culture of mutual trust and respect which supports the development of effective relationships.

### **What happens if the behaviour is repeated?**

This will depend on the behaviour policy of your school and the rules you set in your classroom but if you have asked a pupil to correct their behaviour twice already and you have to return to them again, you may need to issue a consequence.

For example: “Sunita, you need to watch and listen so you can learn. I am going to have to (insert consequence e.g. move your name down, move you to yellow, ask you to come and practise at break). Now please show me your best. Thank you”.

Consequences is something you will explore in more detail in the next session.

### **What happens if I don’t have time to privately correct a pupil’s behaviour?**

If you don’t have time to address an individual pupil’s behaviour privately, you might instead adopt the next technique: lightning-quick public correction.

## Lightning-quick Public Correction

Sometimes it will not be possible to correct a pupil’s behaviour privately.
In such instances, it is important that the pupil under scrutiny is in the spotlight for as short amount of time as possible. This avoids overly embarrassing the pupil or disrupting the focus and attention of other pupils.

This type of public correction should be made as quickly as possible: preferably lightning-quick!

Here’s how to do this:

1. Name the pupil
2. Name the behaviour you want to see (rather than stating what they are doing wrong)
3. Bring the class focus back to the positive behaviour that’s happening in the classroom
4. Reinforce the pupil’s now on-task behaviour (if it occurs)

$I

<h3>Example 1 - Singing a counting song in Early Years:</h3>
“Javed, I need to hear you. Brilliant singing at the back… Much better Javed.” $I

$I

<h3>Example 2 - Independent task in Primary or Secondary</h3>
“Arfaan, pencil moving. Brilliant concentration Toufika and Samantha... That’s much
better Arfaan”. $I

It is of course important that you only acknowledge the now on-task behaviour if the pupil is exhibiting it. Don’t be tempted to praise an individual if they have not shown compliance.

### What happens if the behaviour is repeated?

As before, this will depend on the behaviour policy of your school and the rules you have set in your classroom. If you have asked a pupil to correct their behaviour twice already and you have to return to them again, it’s likely you will need to issue a consequence.

For example: “Lizzie, I need to see you writing. I am going to have to (insert consequence e.g. move your name down, move you to yellow, ask you to come and practise at break). Now please show me your best. Thank you”.

## Private Individual Precise Praise

One final technique that you may use, not so much to address low-level disruption directly but rather to encourage optimal behaviour and learning, is private individual precise praise.

‘Private Individual Precise Praise’ is when you go over to an individual pupil during independent work and whisper some positive praise for the good work or behaviour they have exhibited.

$I

<strong>Example</strong>

You walk over to a pupil, crouch down near them and whisper, “Tom, the explanation you gave to the class just now was outstanding – well done.”
$I

This is a strategy that can help you to build effective and trusting relationships with pupils by balancing correction of behaviour or work with praise.

## Reflection

In your next mentor session, your mentor will observe you using positive and least invasive behaviour management strategies. To help you prepare, reflect on your current teaching practice.

Think of a time when you have intervened with an off-task pupil to correct their behaviour.

- **Did you use the least invasive intervention possible?**
- **How did this impact the pupil?**
- **How did it impact the class and their learning?**
- **What could you do differently next time?**

This session will take **approximately 50 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

As we saw in the last session, when a pupil is off-task or causing low-level disruption, you should try and correct this using one of the least invasive techniques. However, if a pupil keeps exhibiting disruptive behaviours, or if their behaviour is more challenging or severe, it is likely you will need to address this by issuing a consequence or sanction.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Why are consequences or sanctions important?

- How to issue consequences or sanctions effectively

  - Consistent
  - Depersonalised
  - Deferred

- Identifying the appropriate consequences or sanctions

## Why are consequences or sanctions important?

A consequence or sanction is used to reinforce the behavioural expectations that you set in your classroom and communicate shared values that improve both classroom and school culture. Consequences should be used to educate pupils about which behaviours are and are not appropriate and should help them to learn that if they choose to be disruptive, they choose to face the consequences.

Different schools may approach consequences in different ways and often have a behaviour policy which outlines this. For example, some might have a policy that states teachers should give two warnings to a pupil before issuing a consequence.

If there isn’t a system in place in your school, you will need to decide your own system and be consistent with it to ensure you create a predictable environment for pupils where the behavioural expectations are clear.

Because schools vary in their approach to behaviour management, we will focus here on how to issue consequences effectively rather than what type of consequence to issue.

## How to issue consequences effectively

When issuing consequences, it is important to ensure disruption to learning is minimised and you try to maintain pupil-teacher relationships. Some ways you could do this is to ensure your consequences are:

- Consistent
- Depersonalised
- Deferred

In your next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to discuss your school’s behaviour policy and how you can effectively employ consequences in line with it.

## Consistent

It is important that you are consistent with the consequences you issue. For example, if you have decided that pupils talking when you are talking is something you won’t tolerate and will correct (and rightly so), then you must pick up on this behaviour _every_ time and be consistent in how you address it. By being consistent, you help to make your pupils’ learning environment predictable and secure, which benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.

### Issuing consequences consistently

As soon as you ignore or respond differently to a negative behaviour, pupils will be unclear about your expectations. For example, if a negative behaviour is ignored, pupils are more likely to exhibit this behaviour thereafter because they have learnt they can get away with it or that you deem it acceptable because you have allowed it to happen.

### Delivering consequences consistently

Issuing consequences consistently is important but it is equally important that you follow through with them. For example, if you have issued a consequence to a pupil such as missing their break time, then it’s vital that they do. If they don’t (maybe because you forget or because they don’t show up) they will learn that the consequences that you issue are actually empty threats and are meaningless.

Any consequence you issue must be delivered consistently.

$Content
Nothing you do in a classroom will bed in with the students behaviourally unless it's incredibly consistent. If you want something to be a norm, if you want a given behaviour to be the norm, if you want a routine to be normal then it must be done, demonstrated and explained consistently. That this is much harder than many teachers I think suspect, it's something much harder than many schools suspect and it's where many teachers and schools get it wrong.

They can sometimes get it right by demonstrating what these behavioural expectations should be and perhaps at the start of the relationship they're quite clear and explicit about what they should be doing, but then that consistency starts to fall off and if you show children that your norms and routines are inconsistent, they don't become norms. In fact, the norm becomes inconsistency which is why, although it sounds dreary and dull, the best thing we can do as teachers and educators is to make sure that once we've established a rule or norm, we try to be as consistent as possible. This is the glue that holds everything together. Without that glue the bricks fall to the ground. So this means a few things.

First of all, it means being entirely consistent. When you see something matters you have to demonstrate constantly that it matters yourself. Secondly, you have to demonstrate this across time, and again this is perhaps the harder part because your own standards might start to shift or erode as time goes on and you may not even notice it, which is why it's incredibly important that you are super clear about your standards not just with the children but with yourself. It's not enough just to think I want them to behave well. Behave well is far too vague. You want to clarify for the children and for yourself what good behaviour looks like in a queue, waiting to go into the classroom, moving from the carpet to the table, getting books from the shelves or whatever circumstances you think they might struggle with in terms of the behaviour. So that clarity needs to be there not just for the children but also for yourself.

There is also a greater sense of consistency which is that it's terribly important as a member of staff to try and be as consistent as you possibly can with the whole school community and the whole school body. This helps to reinforce one another's barriers, expectations and norms. If for instance there’s a whole school norm about not drinking in a lesson or not having a mobile phone in a lesson or something like that, it's terribly important that you adhere to that and uphold it and be as consistent throughout your group as you are with yourself, otherwise you undermine everyone else's attempt to uphold the norm. It may be useful for you in that instant, but it robs the authority of the people next door to you and they may be struggling with their behaviour, perhaps even more than yourself.

A good example of this would be for example, you're trying to tell children that you don't want them to shout out and let's say you want them to put their hands up whenever they want to speak to you. Now that's fine, that's a perfectly acceptable norm to have. What you might do then is ask a question like ‘when is the Battle of Hastings?’ A child might just shout out the answer and the mistake for the teacher would be then to say “no you mustn't shout out but yes, that's the answer”, and then move on as if nothing has happened because that child has learned to reinforce that behaviour. That child has learned that in order to get attention he should shout out and he doesn't need to put his hand up. The children who have their hands up have learnt ‘what’s the point in putting my hand up?’ and the children that never speak have been pushed further and further away from participating in the lesson. So ironically, although the teacher thought they were being nice, what they've done is they’ve reinforced a negative norm and encourage children to shout out. But what you should do to make sure that norm is more consistent is by once the students shouts out the answer to the Battle of Hastings, they say “I'm waiting for a hand up” and then take an answer from somebody else who has their hand up, emphasize that that was good because they had their hand up and then say to the child “I need to speak to in a few minutes about your behaviour.”

In other words, actions must have consequence and norms must be uphold otherwise it's dramatically easy to be inconsistent and to reinforce that inconsistency. So, consistency is the glue that keeps all of this together.

### Keeping track of pupils and their consequences

Keeping track of pupils and their consequences can be challenging. One way to support you to do this is by using a notebook to record names of pupils you need to follow-up with to ensure you don’t forget.

Your school may also have a central system to support with tracking behaviour and consequences, something you may wish to ask your mentor about in your next meeting.

## Depersonalised

As a teacher, you are a key role model, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of your pupils. Therefore, when issuing consequences, it’s important you focus on the behaviour itself - and not on the pupil. This has several benefits:

- It is least intrusive as it refocuses the learning quickly by naming the negative behaviour and therefore encouraging the pupil to correct this.
- It helps to maintain positive relationships with your pupils and establish a supportive and inclusive learning environment because you are labelling the behaviour as negative rather than the pupil themselves.
- It gives the opportunity to model courteous behaviour that you would expect from pupils by demonstrating how to speak to individuals in a respectful way.

### How can you ensure your consequences are depersonalised?

The language you use will support you to do this as demonstrated in the non-example and example below.

$I

<h3>Non-example</h3>
“You just can’t listen, can you? Move your card down,”

This labels the pupil, not their behaviour. This may have a negative impact on the pupil’s self-esteem and may make them more likely to think they can’t achieve and thus ‘give-up’. It may also be damaging to your relationship with this pupil as it doesn’t help to create a respectful and trusting learning environment and doesn’t take the pupil’s feelings into consideration.
$I

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
“James, you’re talking, I’m moving your name down. Look this way like I know you
can. Thanks.”

This labels the negative behaviour (talking), not the pupil and gives them a solution for how to get back on track. It is also much more positive. Below are the key features that make this example successful:

<ul>
  <li>
    Names the pupil so there is no uncertainty around who the teacher is
    addressing (James)
  </li>
  <li>
    Identifies the negative behaviour so the pupil knows why they are receiving
    a consequence (you’re talking)
  </li>
  <li>
    States the consequence <em>(I’m moving your name down)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ends positively and assumes respectful cooperation{" "}
    <em>(Look this way like I know you can. Thanks).</em>
  </li>
</ul>
$I

## Deferred

The defining feature of a differed consequence is that it places ownership on the pupil by giving them the option to follow your instructions or face a more severe consequence later.

Unlike the quick correction you might use to correct a behaviour first time round, a deferred consequence is more serious and will take place later – for example at break time, lunch time, or after school.

This type of consequence should be used when a pupil continues to disrupt a lesson or to disobey your instructions and the consequence given should align with the behavioural policy or class sanctions you have set.

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
If you have already asked a pupil to put their phone away two times and they still
haven’t, you would give them the <em>choice</em> to do this or face the consequences
of not doing this. To issue this deferred consequence, you might say:

<em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">
  “If you choose not to put the phone away, I’ll have to ask you to stay back
  after class”.

By giving pupils the choice, before issuing that more severe consequence, you give them the opportunity to correct their behaviour which supports their emotional and behavioural self-regulation which can impact upon their success at school and beyond.

If a pupil does not make the right choice, it is important that you issue the deferred consequence and follow-up on it. By doing this, you are teaching pupils that you will be consistent in rigorously maintaining your behavioural expectations.

  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

In you next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to share your reflections and discuss how you can deliver effective consequences in line with your school’s behaviour policy.

## Identifying the appropriate consequences or sanctions

Knowing the appropriate consequences or sanctions to give for a certain behaviour can be tricky as behaviour is context specific and arises for a multitude of reasons meaning no one situation is the same.

It is important to develop an understanding of how to deal with challenging situations that may occur in your classroom so you can respond quickly to behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety. Such situations may include, pupil refusal, swearing, racial abuse, or showing signs of aggression or physical abuse. If such incidences do arise, you need to know how to respond appropriately.

As with low-level disruption, it’s important to be consistent with the approach you take to sanctioning for these more challenging behaviours.

Your school will likely have their own policy or approach to addressing these types of behaviours. This will often include when to remove a pupil from your classroom, when to escalate an incident to a more senior member of staff, or when external services may need to be involved.

If you aren’t yet sure what these policies are, discuss your school behaviour policy with your mentor in your next meeting.

## Case studies

In your next mentor meeting, you will have the opportunity to discuss what you have learnt this session and how to respond to persistent and challenging behaviour in your school context.

To prepare for this, choose one case study below and decide how you would address the pupil’s behaviour in line with your school’s approach. Make notes ready to discuss with your mentor in your next meeting.

<h4>
  <strong>Pupil background</strong>
</h4>
Pupil A is in Reception. He hasn't been to a nursery prior to attending Reception.
He joined at the beginning of the year. He doesn’t have a mother but lives with his
dad and two older brothers who attend the same school. His dad engages with school
when he can. He works shifts so sometimes is unavailable to speak to at the beginning
or end of the day. When this happens, his sister collects his children from school.
Is dad is concerned about his son's behaviour and regularly asks for ways to support
his son both at school and at home.
<h4>
  <strong>The incident</strong>
</h4>
Pupil A occasionally demonstrates aggressive behaviour. In the past, he has thrown
items in the classroom such as pencils or building blocks but has never harmed another
pupil until this incident. He was exploring Numicon in the sandpit in the outdoor
learning area. Another pupil came over to join him. Immediately, Pupil A shouted
“No” and then threw the Numicon piece at that child’s face and bit his arm leaving
a bruise. $EndContent $EndAccordion

<h4>
  <strong>Pupil background</strong>
</h4>
This pupil is in year 6. He joined the school halfway through year 4 and comes from
a have a challenging background. His parents are separated and have been for the
duration of his time at our school. Both parents hold very different views on behaviour
and as a result have different expectations of their child which can confuse him
as it muddles the boundaries we try to set at school. His mother is approachable
and willing to try and support him in school but often makes excuses for his lack
of engagement or disruptive behaviour, often blaming the lesson for not being engaging
or challenging enough for him, whereas their father is very strict and holds extremely
high expectations of him. He sees his father every other weekend and I always notice
a difference in his behaviour after spending time with his father. I have no contact
with his father as his mother is his primary carer. He has very low self-esteem and
resilience.
<h4>
  <strong>The incident</strong>
</h4>
The pupil regularly demonstrates challenging behaviour across a range of settings
throughout the day. On one occasion, I was teaching long division, explaining the
steps and asking pupils to attempt further questions on their whiteboards. Whilst
I was teaching, I could see he was not tracking me or following my explanation. When
asked to complete examples on his whiteboard, he rested his head on his arms and
ignored my request. $EndContent $EndAccordion

<h4>
  <strong>Pupil background</strong>
</h4>
The student (Student A) is in Year 11. He and his twin brother (Student B) have officially
attended the school since arriving in Year 8 following their parents’ divorce, but
both have low attendance, with the student in question on the verge of persistent
non-attendance in Year 10. The boys live with their mother, though Student B has
spent periods living with their father. Mother is personally supportive, but struggles
to influence the behaviour of the boys, often accepting their misbehaviour or non-attendance
in order to maintain her own relationship with them and avoid the risk of them returning
to their father. Father refuses to interact with school. Both boys are socially active,
with reports of smoking, drinking and anti-social behaviour outside of school. Both
students are theoretically bright, but have limited motivation and concentration,
content gaps due to absence, and a tendency to react aggressively or ‘walk out’ when
challenged.
<h4>
  <strong>The incident</strong>
</h4>
Student A and Student B are both in the same class for their English lessons, and
regularly distract each other when present. Student B’s attendance has been noticeably
higher than his brother’s. In the run-up to a set of mock exams, both students, following
some pressure on and support from both parents, were going through a phase of regular
attendance. While revising poetry, some of which Student A had not studied due to
absence, Student A was distracted by Student B. When reprimanded, Student B focused
on the work in question. Student A continued to attempt to catch his brother’s attention.
He refused to engage with the tasks given, rejected support offered, and eventually
threw his pen across the table, asserted that he couldn’t do it and couldn’t see
the point, added “Fuck this”, and walked out of the lesson. $EndContent $EndAccordion

It’s important that you don’t feel alone in dealing with challenging behaviour - you have a right to be supported by your school to deal with it. If you do encounter incidents that you are unsure how to deal with or don’t feel confident to address, you should seek support for your mentor, a member of your senior leadership team and possibly your SENCo. Managing behaviour is a whole school responsibility so you shouldn’t feel as though you have to act alone.

## Repairing and rebuilding relationships

Some consequences or sanctions can have a negative impact upon your relationship with your pupils depending on how they have been issued or what the circumstances were. On these occasions, it is important to find time to follow these interactions up with a restorative conversation. This enables you to discuss the incident, reinforce your expectations and demonstrate that you have considered and understood your pupils’ feelings.

$Content
Ok, so how do you repair relationships? What do you do when things go wrong either with individual people or with an entire class (hopefully not)? There's lots of things that can be done. In fact, there's lots of things that must be done and one of the first things that must be thought of is ‘what are the consequences for these actions?’, ‘What needs to happen?’ So for example if you have got a whole school consequence system, if you have a C1 or C2 or students are meant to loose golden time or students are meant to have their parents called at home or have a postcard home or whatever the consequence of the action is, it's terribly important that you follow that to the letter unless there's a reasonable exception to be made. The reason why that's important is because you're not just upholding the norm for that child but also for the entire class. Students need to know that that actions matter and if that means a mild sanctioned, then so be it. If you take the sanction away and you can't run classes entirely on sanction but if you take the sanction away, then you lose the deterrent effect which might be implicit in that sanction. So, trying to be as consistent as possible even if you don't like or feel like giving the sanctions. In fact particularly even then because you don't want to come across as unfair to the children by only letting children off because they normally behave well or perhaps there’s some kind of invisible bias - you like them more than others, and that would be a dreadful norm to try to communicate to the children.

So that's the sanction or reward element but perhaps more importantly is how do you then repair that relationship? Because the objective of every response from a teacher should be improving the child's behaviour. And a lot of that is going to be through conversational or pastoral methods. Which is to say that whenever a student achieves any kind of consequence for their action of whatever type, there must be some kind of restorative process where the aspiration is to reintegrate the child into the classroom, but not willy-nilly, but rather with a greater understanding of:

<ul>
  <li>where they went wrong</li>
  <li>what need to do to improve</li>
  <li>
    and why they're still valued and why they're still wanted as a member of a
    classroom.
  </li>
</ul>
We can reprimand students, for example, for misbehaving and do so in a positive way.
We can say things like ‘I expect better of you and I know you can do better’ and
‘is there a reason why you weren't behaving?’ and we might start to unpick and unpack
perhaps some other deeper reasons why children are misbehaving. They may be being
bullied or going through, parents going through divorces at home and so on. That's
what we need to try to find out, particularly if there are patterns of misbehaviour.
But in the conversation where we reintegrate the children to the classroom, we need
to establish those three things:
<ul>
  <li>What went wrong?</li>
  <li>What you can do better.</li>
  <li>
    And you are still valued, and I want you in the classroom, but I want you to
    be better.
  </li>
</ul>
If the child can acknowledge and understand those three things, there is a chance
that behaviour will improve. What mustn't happen is that the child is simply reintroduced
into the classroom environment because being removed from the classroom environment,
being asked to wait outside in the corridor, being given some kind of sanction is
not in itself restorative - it does not cure or improve people. What it tends to
do is give the class a bit of respite, which is important but isn't going to be focused
on restoring the behaviour of the student. So, give them ways forward.

And the time to do this, the time to have this conversation - it depends. If the student’s misbehaviour is small, if the reasons for it are fairly mundane like they were just mucking around, then the response and the restorative conversation and the attempt to repair needs to be as quickly as possible: the next break, the next lunch time, at the end of the day and so on. Perhaps even in the class if it’s a very small incident. But if the student’s behaviour is extreme or they become very upset or you've become very upset, then the time to have that conversation is not immediately. Because when people are agitated or upset or Adrenaline's rushing to the system and when the blood is hot, those are not the best times to have rational, intelligent conversations. Those are the times to think to yourself, ‘we need a bit of breathing space and we need to separate ourselves and allow ourselves to calm down’. You cannot control a fire, you can certainly contain it and let it burn itself out and even the most agitated student will calm down and even that was agitated teacher will calm down. So, be aware of you and yourself in this process and ask yourself ‘is this the right time for me to have this sort of conversation?’ But crucially the conversation must be had and if there's a small incident, it can be a short conversation. If it’s a bigger one, it needs to be a long, more extended conversation, possibly using other parties from the school, possibly using people from the students home as other parties to try to sustain and support the reintegration.

This session will take **approximately 40 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Pupils tend to enjoy learning and do better when they are more intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated to achieve. Therefore, you should help pupils journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically.

To support you to do this, this session will explore:

- What determines intrinsic motivation?

- How can you boost motivation?

  - Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success
  - Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes
  - Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals.

## What determines intrinsic motivation?

Pupils’ intrinsic motivation is complex as it is influenced by a multitude of factors such as:

- Their prior experiences, for example, within a given subject, or with a given teacher.
- Their perception of success and failure – whether they view failure as a part of learning and whether they believe their capabilities are fixed or under their control.

As a result, a pupil’s level of motivation can change depending on the circumstance and context of the situation they are in. For example, a pupil may be very motivated to work hard in their maths lesson but not in their PE lesson. Or maybe a pupil used to be motivated in their maths lessons in year 2, but in year 3 they are not.

As motivation is so malleable, you can influence it,

### How can you boost motivation?

Motivation is determined by pupils’ experiences of certain situations or environments. Therefore, to boost pupils’ motivation, it is more effective to change their experiences and environment rather than to try and reason with them. You can do this by:

- Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success
- Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes
- Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals.

## Providing opportunities for meaningful success

As a teacher, you can influence your pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils can experience meaningful success.

Success drives motivation. You are much more likely to want to engage in activity if you have previously experienced success with it as opposed to failure. Therefore, you can motivate pupils by helping them to experience success when learning. However, there is a careful balance to strike when doing this. If a problem or activity is too tricky or too easy, pupils are unlikely to get the same sense of achievement (Willingham, 2009). Therefore, it is important that you strive to set you pupils challenging but achievable tasks. However, making tasks achievable can be tricky. The curriculum consists of a great deal of challenging content that pupils might find difficult to master, but it isn’t always possible or beneficial to pupils to overly simplify this content. Instead, to support pupils to achieve meaningful success, Willingham (2009) suggests you can help to make the _thinking_ easier.

There are multiple ways you can do this and many of these will be explored throughout this programme. In this session, you will explore how to help pupils achieve meaningful success by ensuring they have enough thinking time to respond to questions or discussions and are provided with the opportunity to gather and collate their thoughts before sharing them with the class. One way you can do this is through a technique called ‘Everybody Writes’ or by using talk partners.

## 'Everybody Writes' or talk partners

‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners is a great way to support pupils to be successful in their answers. This is because it provides pupils with time to think about their answer before sharing it with the whole class.

When asking pupils a challenging question or asking them to engage in a classroom discussion, tell them to write down their answer or thoughts before asking them to share this with the class. For younger pupils, asking them to spend some time thinking about their answer and then using talk partners works in the same way and has the same benefits for a class discussion.

This has three main benefits:

1. This will ensure that every pupil has a prepared answer to your question providing all pupils the opportunity to achieve success.
2. It increases the time that pupils have to process and think about the question and therefore will increase the depth of the answer.
3. You can circulate the classroom as pupils are writing their answers or discussing it with their partner and select a pupil that has a good answer to share and/or pick up on any misconceptions as part of the discussion.

To increase pupils' success, you may want to display or model using a writing or speaking frame as this will help to increase the focus and rigour of pupils’ written ideas or dialogue.

Watch a video of a teacher using ‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners and consider the following questions:

- **How did the teacher support all pupils to be successful?**
- **What impact did ‘Everybody Writes’ or talk partners have on the quality of the answers?**

## Create a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes

Just as feelings of success can lead to motivation, feelings of failure can lead to demotivation. This could be problematic because when learning new concepts, there are likely to be times when pupils misunderstand something and make errors, in fact this is often a critical part of learning. If pupils don’t recognise this as an important part of learning, and instead see this as failure, then it is likely to demotivate them from further engagement.

Creating a positive learning environment where pupils feel safe to make mistakes and recognise this as an important part of learning is likely to increase their motivation to learn.

### How can you create a positive environment where pupils feel safe to make mistakes?

There are a number of ways you can do this:

- Tell pupils that mistakes and misconceptions are a part of learning.
- Praise pupils for their effort and progress rather than whether they are correct or not.
- Where pupils have made public mistakes or errors, thank them for their answer and for allowing you use their answer as a learning point for the class.

Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes will take time, particularly where pupil’s academic confidence is low. Where this is the case, it is important to regularly reflect on the language you are using with pupils and that you ensure you are planning regular opportunities for them to be meaningfully successful.

## Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals

People are intrinsically motivated when they have autonomy over what they do and are given meaningful choices about what they engage with. However, in the classroom setting, it is difficult to present pupils with choice over what they learn or how. This is because they are novices, and are therefore, perhaps not best placed to make those decisions.

As a result, in order to develop buy-in from your pupils, it’s important that you explain to them why they are engaging in certain tasks and activities and help them see how their success in school is related to achieving their long-term goals.

One way to do this is to show pupils the journey of their learning and how different topics and subjects will build upon each other, throughout the year and their school journey. Some schools use curriculum maps to do this.

Another way is to ask pupils, ‘Why do you want to be successful?’ and ask them to record this on a piece of paper or a post-it note. This can be used on a display and constantly referred to throughout the term or year.

By providing pupils with opportunities to articulate their long-term goals and linking this to their success in school, you help to develop their intrinsic motivation to succeed.

Of course, it is also important that you support pupils to achieve these, for example, by helping them to master challenging content which builds towards their long-term goals.

$I

<h3>Primary example</h3>
If a pupil’s long-term goal is to improve their handwriting, you might support pupils
to achieve this by providing them with activities that improve their fine motor skills,
providing them with opportunities to practise individual letter formations and recognising
and praising their efforts during writing tasks. Providing practise opportunities
and recognising success will help to develop intrinsic motivation. $I

$I

<h3>Secondary example</h3>
If a pupil’s long-term goal is to go to university to study being a doctor, they
will most likely need study biology, chemistry and maths or physics at A-level. Therefore,
they will need a good foundational understanding of those subjects at GCSE level.
If you teach those subjects, you can support pupils to achieve their long-term goal
by carefully planning how you teach challenging content to support pupils to master
it. There are many factors which make up effective teaching and these will be explored
in subsequent modules throughout the programme. $I

Sometimes you will teach pupils who are much more challenging to motivate than others. This is because all pupils have a vast range of experiences and beliefs about their own capabilities. Trying to motivate disengaged pupils can be very challenging.

Pupil A was a child that had earned himself a bit of a reputation for lack of motivation and lack of engagement in lessons. Behaviour and attitude on the playground were often highlighted as an area of concern and learning time was often used to resolve issues after these unstructured times.

In September, I really wanted to engage this pupil and ensure he knew that this year was a fresh start and a new opportunity to shine. Therefore, I really focussed on positive choices and praised this pupil at every opportunity and ensured I shared these with his parents. I speak to all parents regularly. I make a point of contacting them or arranging meetings to discuss positive behaviour so that we can mutually support one another and so the parents see school as a positive place to be too. Pupil A’s parents informed me that they really appreciated this, and it boosted their child’s self-esteem.

At the start of each year, I create a Class Charter with the class and discuss what rights and responsibilities we all have. All the children sign this, and the expectations are made clear from the start. I refer to this throughout the year to remind pupils of our shared values when they demonstrate negative learning behaviours. This has been a great way to support Pupil A to adapt his behaviour as it helps him to self-regulate his emotions and, consequently, his actions.

Due to the learning needs of the whole class this year, I have really tried to promote a love of reading. To do this, I talk to the children about authors they like and books they would like to see in our classroom. I also carefully select class novels that I know will engage the children and create great opportunities for cross curricular learning. For example, Pupil A is very passionate about football, so I selected ‘Tom Palmer’s Defenders’ as our first-class novel and linked this to our Vikings unit. Pupil A was a very reluctant reader in September however, as a result of the actions I have taken, I now get regular feedback from his parents to say that he is reading regularly and even goes to bed early to read his books. To develop this further, I also set up a bed time reading box (with a new book, hot chocolate and marshmallows, and a new bookmark) which I send home each week to the children who are trying hard to read at home and in school. Pupil A was keen to get this award and was one of the first to take it home.

His positive engagement with reading has impacted upon his attitudes towards writing too. In the transition meeting with his previous teacher, I was told that Pupil A was a very reluctant writer in Year 4, but I’ve certainly not seen this in Year 5. I think he is much more motivated to engage with tasks he finds challenging because I provide him with opportunities to experience success and celebrate this with the class.

I have provided lots of opportunities for Pupil A throughout the year to really shine, be more responsible and achieve meaningful success. He’s enjoyed being a Playground Pal on the KS1 playground and this has significantly improved his own playground choices. I recognised that Pupil A had a real interest in our recent science unit, Earth and Space, so I selected him to work with our EYFS children to share his knowledge as they were also learning about Space. During and after his visit, he was praised by the staff and received great feedback about his excellent subject knowledge and kind, caring demeanour.

Pupil A is now exceeding his end of year targets across all areas of the curriculum. This is a result of mutual respect, holding high expectations and creating many opportunities for Pupil A to achieve meaningful success

A Year 9-11 Spanish Case Study
$EndHeading
$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
In Year 9, Pupil A was chatty, frequently distracted and was often heard saying that she ‘couldn’t do Spanish’. During that year, she also had an extended period of absence. On her return she was withdrawn, worried and very unconfident with Spanish. Now in Year 11, she enjoys Spanish and is working at a strong grade 3 with elements of a 4.

I believe that she is very much capable of achieving a 4 in the summer exams. I have implemented many strategies to increase her motivation in the subject and this has brought about a change in her attitude. One of the key strategies was utilising parents evening. Towards the end of year 9 I had an in-depth chat with her parents and herself during parents evening. We discussed what she was finding difficult in Spanish and what she felt she needed to improve. Whilst this is nothing out of the ordinary for a standard parent’s evening, I really felt this was the first turning point for her. Her mum was very supportive, which was a real boost for her. We talked for a long time and I felt that she really enjoyed having her own voice and understanding that her thoughts and feelings were being considered.

At parent’s evening, Pupil A expressed a concern that she was behind with vocabulary. I was able to give her a department booklet which aims to catch up new students to GCSE with the key vocabulary. Whilst this booklet wasn’t specifically designed for her, I decided to make use of the available resources in the school. She responded really well to receiving this resource and completed the booklet at home. I think she liked the security and feelings of success associated with knowing a lot of the words whilst still having a chance to check she was secure with them.

As luck would have it the department also had a few spare revision guides. I took the decision to lend the revision guides to her at the start of year 10, again, to make use of available resources within the school, as I knew that she was a girl that needed pushing to the 4. Again, I really feel that these very small but significant gestures of help intrinsically motivated her. I think they showed that we were all on her side and believed in her ability to make great progress and succeed.

During year 10, we did a few pieces of work where pupils had to create their own ‘versions’ of resources. For example, pupils created their own personalised verb sheets. She enjoyed the creative side of this activity. She has since taken it upon herself to create her own ‘version’ of other resources such as a writing revision sheet and a speaking strategies PowerPoint. I think it is fantastic that she chooses to work so independently and have always praised her for this great level of engagement. This praise further motivates her to engage and succeed.

To help ensure success, I provide her with small chunks of information to learn at a time. For example, she has been learning speaking questions in small sections rather than all at once. She has responded very well to learning in small bursts.

Throughout all of this, I really feel that building a personal relationship with Pupil A has been vital. At the beginning of Year 9, it sometimes felt that all I ever did was tell her off. This was detrimental to our relationship and wasn’t motivating her to change so I quickly realised I needed to switch the focus of conversation to be about how I could help her to succeed. Once we were on a more positive footing towards the end of Year 9, I could see that she was actually sometimes stressed in Spanish. The interventions I have put in place above as well as interventions in lessons, such as giving her targeted support or praise, have all helped to ease this stress, provide her with feelings of success and motivate her to engage in the subject both in school and at home.

As noted in the previous session, it’s important that you don’t feel alone in dealing with challenging behaviour - you have a right to be supported by your school to deal with it. If you do encounter incidents that you are unsure how to deal with or don’t feel confident to address, you should seek support for your mentor, a member of your senior leadership team and possibly your SENDCo. Managing behaviour is a whole school responsibility so you shouldn’t feel as though you have to act alone.

## Application to practice

In your next mentor session, you will be observed using strategies that help to build pupil’s motivation such as:

- Providing opportunities for pupils to experience meaningful success
- Creating a positive learning environment where it’s safe to make mistakes
- Generating buy-in by linking success in school to pupils’ long-term goals

You will also and have the opportunity to discuss how to build the intrinsic motivation of any disengaged learners you may teach.

This session will take **approximately 50 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

It is important that you create a learning environment that challenges and stretches all pupils.

To support you to do this, you will explore:

- The impact of high expectations

- How to hold high expectations for contributions and engagement

  - Holding high expectations for contributions
  - Using count downs or timers
  - Making the beginning and end of activities clear

## The impact of high expectations

The expectations you have of your pupils can impact their progress and outcomes. Research has shown that when teachers have high expectations for their pupils, their outcomes are better (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek 2018, Hattie 2008, Rubie Davis et al 2014). Therefore, it is important that you hold high expectations for _all_ your pupils.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Think about your classroom practice and consider the following questions. Record
your reflection in your notepad:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Do you have high behavioural and academic expectations for <em>all</em>{" "}
      your pupils or do your behavioural and academic expectations differ for
      different pupils?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Why do you think this is and what impact might this be having on your
      pupils’ progress and outcomes?

## Holding high expectations for contributions and engagement

Setting clear expectations helps to communicate to your pupils what you expect of them. Through doing this, you can convey the values of your classroom and school, which can help to improve the learning environment and culture. You should spend some time considering what your behavioural and academic expectations are. It might be useful to discuss these with your mentor to ensure they are fitting and align with your school’s behaviour policy.

When considering the level of concentration and contributions that you expect from your pupils, it is helpful to consider the concept of ratio. This can be broken down into two parts:

Ratio in the classroom is the ratio between two variables (Lemov, 2015):

1. Participation ratio - how many pupils in the classroom are participating in the task. The ideal here is every pupil.
2. Think-ratio - the level of rigour in the thinking and engagement that you foster in your pupils.

$Figure

$EndFigure

The goal is to get to point A on the graph where you have both a high participation _and_ high think ratio in your classroom. To do this you must demonstrate high expectations of _all_ your pupils, expecting _everyone_ to concentrate and participate in your lesson. This will maximise learning and progress for all pupils, helping them to achieve, feel success and therefore feel motivated to continue participating.

Holding and rigorously maintaining high expectations is important but knowing how to implement them in the classroom and demonstrate them to your pupils can be challenging.

In the next part of this session, you will explore some strategies that will help you demonstrate high expectations for engagement and motivate pupils to remain focused, such as:

- Holding high expectations for contributions
- Using countdowns or timers
- Making the beginning and end of activities clear

## Holding high expectations for contributions

It is important that you communicate your belief in the academic potential of _all_ your pupils. To do this, you should set and maintain clear behavioural expectations for concentration and contributions during a lesson.

One way to do this is by setting the expectation that all pupils should be prepared to contribute during a lesson if asked to do so. This encourages pupils to take responsibility for learning and emphasises the importance of trying, even if a pupil is unsure of their response. It is quite common in this scenario for a pupil not to answer or to say, “I don’t know”.

If a pupil doesn’t respond or says, “I don’t know”, there are several ways you can support them to answer the question, such as:

- Providing a hint or prompt to support them to contribute
- Asking another pupil to give a hint to help them to respond
- Asking another pupil to answer, and then go back to the original pupil to repeat or add to their response

This helps to build a culture of engagement and inclusion. It also clearly conveys to your pupils that you expect them to remain focused during your lesson so they can be successful in their learning.

    </strong>
  </li>
</ul>

## Using countdowns or timers

It’s important that pupils in your class recognise that learning time is valuable and that you expect them to work purposefully throughout the lesson or day. One way to support you to communicate this to your pupils and help them to stay engaged in activities is to share the duration of time that pupils have to complete certain activities. This has several benefits:

- It supports the pupils to remain focussed on learning
- It can create a sense of achievement when pupils complete a task in the time
- It supports pupils manage their learning time
- It supports the pace of the lesson, helping you as a teacher to keep the lesson on track

You can use a timer for almost all classroom activities whether they are academic or not. Using a timer works best if you:

- State how long pupils have
- State what pupils are expected to do in this time
- Visibly share the timer and refer to it. For younger pupils this might be in the form of a sand timer and for older pupils this might be in the form of a countdown clock.
- Provide check points along the way e.g. you should be at question 5 by now.

## Making the beginning and end of activities clear

Another way to support pupils to stay focused and engaged during lessons is to make the start and end of activities clear. This can help to keep the pace of the lesson and therefore, keep pupils alert and focused. Some ways you can do this are:

1. **Clear start**
   Make sure that all pupils know when to start the task by using a clear cue. Everyone starting tasks at the same time means that it keeps pupils focussed and the environment purposeful as pupils don’t drift into starting activities or have a quick chat before they begin. For example, when starting pupils off on a task, you might say, “Three, two one, off you go.”
2. **Clear finish**
   Ensuring that all pupils know when the activity has ended and what they should do next means that pupils are not finishing at different times and have a chance to start to be off task. Making it clear when the time is up and what to do to show that they are ready is key to you being able to get the pupils attention and move on with the lesson. For example, using a timer with a sound to indicate time is up and then giving instructions of what to do such as, “Pencils down, eyes on me.”
3. **Provide positive reinforcement**
   Positively reinforcing your expectations helps to ensure all pupils start and finish the task as and when you directed. For example, when starting a task, you might say, “I can see four tables have started, well done”. Equally, when finishing a task, you might say, “Pencils down, eyes on me, thanks front row, I have all of you looking at me”.

## Application to practice

In your next mentor meeting, your mentor will observe how you hold high expectations and maintain high levels of engagement.

To prepare for this, plan to demonstrate high expectations and maintain high levels of engagement by using one or some of the following strategies. Script what you will say to support you. This will then be used in your mentor interaction.

**Holding high expectations for contributions:**

- Providing a hint or prompt to support them to contribute
- Asking another pupil to give a hint to help them to respond
- Asking another pupil to answer, and then go back to the original pupil to repeat or add to their response

**Using countdowns or timers:**

- State how long pupils have
- State what pupils are expected to do in this time
- Visibly share the timer and refer to it. For younger pupils this might be in the form of a sand timer and for older pupils this might be in the form of a countdown clock.
- Provide check points along the way e.g. you should be at question 5 by now.

**Making the beginning and end of activities clear:**

- Clear start
- Clear finish
- Provide positive reinforcement

Motivation
$EndHeading
$Summary
By Joanna Macauley
$EndSummary
$Content

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Pupil motivation is a key driver in pupil progress, attainment and outcomes. T
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  eachers have the ability to influence the academic potential of their classes
  by raising their expectations of them and expecting more. By holding high
  expectations, you encourage pupils to work harder, do more and thus achieve
  more.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It is clear that pupils with high levels of motivation are more likely to step
  out of their comfort zones and take risks in order to make improvements in
  their work. Conversely, pupils with low levels of motivation are likely to
  give up easily, leave work incomplete or refuse to answer questions in lessons
  because they “do not know”. 
</span>
<h4>
  <b>So what impacts pupil’s motivation?</b>
</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Pupils levels of motivation can be a product of their own experiences for
  example if a pupil has always struggled with algebra in maths for example this
  may then impact their level of motivation when studying algebra as they assume
  it will be difficult and therefore it becomes more difficult. Pupils can also
  be influenced by parental views of certain subjects. As a languages teacher I
  have experienced many occasions where at parents evenings parents have
  explained how much they struggled in French, didn’t like speaking out loud and
  could not understand the grammatical concepts – this has then influenced their
  child’s motivation and therefore success in languages. 
</span>
<h4>
  <b>How can you develop pupil’s motivation?</b>
</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Building pupil success in lessons is key in developing pupil motivation. There
  is a balance to be struck between challenging pupils “to think hard”,
  supporting pupils with scaffolding and modelling, and increasing levels of
  pupil independence. It is also important for pupils to feel supported in their
  learning environment so that it becomes accepted that all learners make
  mistakes. A key assessment for learning strategy for this is to circulate the
  room during independent practice and where common misconceptions have been
  identified, stop the class and address the issue there and then to prevent the
  error from being learnt. When doing so, it is important to thank the pupil for
  sharing their work and learning with the rest of the class to help maintain a
  safe and positive learning culture.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You can also help to create pupil buy-in during lessons to motivate them to
  engage. One way to do this is to share the learning objectives and make sure
  they are clearly explained, so that pupils are aware of what they are going to
  be doing, why they are doing that and how this links to their long-term goals.

This session will take **approximately 55 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

For learning to take place there must be a lasting change in the pupil’s understanding and capabilities. But what can teachers do to support pupils to learn effectively?

In this session you will explore:

- The impact of the working and long-term memory on learning
- The limitations of the working memory

## A model of the mind

As teachers, every day you are aiming to teach pupils new concepts, ideas, and strategies that they can use and apply inside and outside of school. For any meaningful learning to have taken place, there must be a lasting change in pupils’ understanding and capabilities.

An important factor in learning is **memory**. Over the past 25 years, significant breakthroughs have been made in terms of our understanding of how the mind learns, and how we can support the occurrence of _lasting change_. Having a good understanding of the research around memory and learning will enable you to integrate the findings into your practice, and in turn, help pupils to learn new information more quickly.

Listen to the module expert Ben Riley, the Executive Director of Deans for Impact, as he explains what we know about how pupils learn best, and the role that memory plays in this process.

Hello, I'm Benjamin Riley, the founder and Executive Director of Dean's for Impact - an education non-profit organization based in the United States working to ensure that every child is taught by a well-prepared teacher. And part of what we mean by well-prepared is making sure that all teachers have an understanding of how their pupils learn. And so that's what I'm going to be speaking with you about today is how pupils learn. And we're going to be looking at that through the lens of cognitive science. The outline for this short video is as follows. I'm going to give you some good news, then I'm going to give you some bad news. Then I'm going to show you a bit of a model, a visual model to understand the good and bad news. Then I'm going give you a bit more good news and then we're going to end with a quiz, so we don't have much time - let's dive in.

So, here's the good news. Everything I'm about to talk about when it comes to how students learn is not going to change. As I'm recording this video, we're living in a time of great global uncertainty but what's good is that the processes by which students learn aren't going to change because of the pandemic. They're not going to change because of anything happening with technology. These are the products, the products of millions of years of evolution is what's resulted in how our minds work and so that's a good thing because it means we can actually plan around that. And further, I'm going borrow a phrase from my good friend - a cognitive scientist named Dan Willingham who I'm going to reference repeatedly, who says that ‘children are more alike than different in how they think and learn’. And thank goodness for that. It means that we can sort of understand this cognitive architecture - in other words, how our minds work, and know that that's going to be generally true for the vast majority of students that we work with. Again, barring some cognitive impairment. So that's the good news.

Now here's the bad news. Those millions of years of evolution have produced minds that are actually not built to think, which is counterintuitive, right? I mean obviously all thinking takes place in the mind so what do we mean when we say minds have not evolved to think? Well, let me try to explain and I'm now going to bring in a super fancy model what Dan Willingham calls ‘just about the simplest model of the mind’:

<img
  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4092"
  src="https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/11/Simplest-model-of-the-mind-2-edited-e1606478777269.jpg"
  alt=""
  width="600"
  height="450"
/>

And here we go: our minds are basically over here (the working memory and long-term memory), they consist in this simple model of our working memory - the place where conscious thought happens, and our long-term memory – the knowledge that we've stored. You might think of this as the hard drive where we've kept all of our things that we've learned in life.

Now all of the active thinking that takes place in our consciousness happens here in our working memory and then if we're effective in educating, it becomes part of our long-term memory and you can see over here I've labelled something called the environment and I'm not referring to trees with deer running through them, although that could be part of it. This is just everything that's happening outside of our minds. It's literally the world and as you can see, our working memory interacts with the environment and then interacts with long-term memory.

Now the bad news is, as far as we know, there's nothing we can really do about working memory. There is very limited capacity that we have to hold more than a few thoughts at any given time and it's just fixed. But the good news, and here's the bit of good news, is that we can add to our long-term memories as far as we know in virtually limitless capacity. The challenge is that because this (the working memory) is so limited, we don't actually want to think - it's hard, it's effortful. Now of course there's great exceptions that I'm not saying that we never want to think, but by and large we're looking for ways around having to think and so the key again in education is to try to get students to think about material that we want them to remember. And you may be thinking this may sound very abstract so let me give you a very salient example:

<em>
  Right now if you're listening to me and you're understanding what I'm saying,
  you're doing so because you've learned the English language and so you can
  actually think about the content of what I'm saying rather than worrying about
  translating the words that I'm saying. Now for some of you who may have
  English as a second or third or fourth language, it may be a little bit
  harder. I might be talking a little bit too fast; I might have used vocabulary
  words you're less familiar with.
</em>

And so this is important for teachers to keep in mind: is that all of your students are going to come with different aspects of knowledge, different things in their long term memory. And the challenge for you is going to be figuring out ‘how do we get them to think about the things that I need them to think about and not overly burden their working memory when I'm not exactly sure what's in their long-term memory.’ It's a challenge and I can't say that there's any easy way to solve it, but that in some ways is the beauty of teaching: is that you are constantly trying to figure that out and do what you can to help your students improve what's here.

So that was a very hurried introduction to the cognitive science of how we learn and how pupils learn and so now we're going to have a very brief quiz:

Effective teachers can help their pupils improve

a) their working memory
b) their long-term memory
c) both
d) neither

Have a think for a second.

The answer of course is b) effective teachers can help students improve their long-term memory.

## Working and long-term memory

As you have heard from Ben Riley, a useful way to think about memory is as a system, comprising of two components: long-term memory and working memory.

$Figure
$Alt Diagram shows the relationship between working and long-term memory, with information being recalled from long-term to working memory when needed and processed into long-term for storage. Environmental factors also input into working memory. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Simplest-model-of-the-mind-2.jpg $EndURL $Caption Willingham (2009) $EndCaption
$EndFigure

**Long-term memory** can be considered a store of knowledge that changes and grows as pupils learn. The knowledge remains in the long-term memory until it is needed, when it enters the working memory. For example, if you were asked the question how many legs a spider has, you would remember that the answer is eight. This knowledge has been drawn into your working memory from your long-term memory.

**Working memory** is the site of awareness and thinking, where we hold information that is being actively processed by our mind. The working memory draws upon both the environment and long-term memory to process things. It is very small in capacity and, unlike long-term memory, its capacity cannot be changed.

Within your working memory might be the things you are noticing from your environment, such as the temperature and light levels, as well as things you are currently thinking about. When teaching, it is important that you reduce distractions that will take the focus of the working memory away from what is being taught. For example, ensuring that there is a purposeful learning environment, free from distracting behaviours, or making sure the content you are teaching is pitched correctly in terms of your learners’ abilities. This will ensure pupils are focusing on the new learning, rather than other potential distractors.

The working memory also processes information into long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. It is important to note that the working memory has a very small capacity. Pupils with a learning difficulty that affects their working memory may have a smaller capacity still and will require information to be provided in small steps. For all pupils, the limitations of the working memory have fundamental implications for the process of teaching and learning. This is explored in the next section of the module.

## The limitations of the working memory

The fact that the working memory is limited in its capacity has profound implications for teaching and learning. To experience the limitations of the working memory, try to work out the maths problems below without writing anything down.

1. 2x3
2. 6x7
3. 12x15
4. 183x587
5. 1983x1874

As the questions became more complex, it is likely that you did not know the answer and couldn’t therefore retrieve it from your long-term memory. You would have attempted to hold some information in your working memory and manipulate it. As the numbers got larger still, you may well have tried to remember and manipulate more than your working memory could handle. If this was the case, you would have experienced working memory overload and either become frustrated or given up, feeling that it was impossible to complete.

You may be able to recall times when you noticed that your pupils were experiencing working memory overload, and they put their head down on the desk or became disengaged from a task that they have been working on. If you had been allowed to write down the numbers, or you knew the times tables relating to the questions, the amount of information being processed by your working memory would have been less, meaning that you were having to hold and manipulate less information at the same time.

As a teacher you are introducing pupils to new information all the time, with the intention that they process, manipulate and transfer this knowledge into their long-term memory. Therefore, understanding the limitations of the working memory is critical. The way you deliver new learning to your pupils has a profound impact on whether they learn it or not.

## Avoid overloading the working memory

Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. If you want your pupils to learn and retain new information, you need to avoid overloading the working memory, giving the knowledge a chance of becoming stored in the long-term memory. In this section, we will explore how the capacity of the working memory can be protected by building on pupils’ prior knowledge.

### Considering prior knowledge

As you have already explored, an effective way to avoid overloading the working memory is to be able to draw on information from your long-term memory. When introducing a new concept or idea, building on prior knowledge that is already stored in the long-term memory can mean that you reduce the risk of overloading the working memory, as the pupil can apply some of their prior knowledge to help them understand the new content. As Ben Riley mentioned in his video, pupils may have different levels of prior knowledge around a topic. As such, trying to build on this can be a challenge for teachers.

When you are deciding how to introduce new knowledge, carefully consider the three questions below to help pupils use their prior knowledge to support their understanding:

1. What existing knowledge and vocabulary do pupils need to have in order to be able to access and understand the new idea or concept?
2. What are the key ideas and concepts that you want your pupils to learn?
3. How could you link these key ideas and concepts to their prior knowledge?

The answers to these three questions will provide a starting place for your planning, and an understanding of where to pitch new learning. Listen to Teacher Educator and History teacher Lee Donaghy talk through how he assessed his pupils’ prior knowledge, and how he built on this in an effort to avoid overloading the working memory.

I was preparing to teach the module ‘USA 1945-75’ for my year 10 GCSE history class. We were focusing specifically on the ‘Red Scare’, a period of heightened fear of Communism and its threat to the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and were working towards answering the enquiry question: ‘How did the international situation make Americans more fearful of communism?’.

In order to access this topic, I knew my pupils needed to know the international context at the end of World War Two. I was aware that they had studied World War Two in year 9, and so checking their prior knowledge of it, and re-teaching it if necessary, would mean they all had the foundational knowledge needed to help them learn the events, people and concepts that we would cover in this new topic.

I checked this foundational knowledge through a simple assessment task where I asked pupils to list the theatres and combatants in World War Two, as well as recall some of key dates &lt;show slide 1&gt;. This showed me, almost inevitably, that some pupils had remembered more of this knowledge than others. This meant I had to re-teach this information, by re-capping events firstly in Europe &lt;show slide 2&gt; and then in the Far East &lt;show slide 3&gt; during the war. I then secured this specific knowledge in pupils’ long-term memories through repeated retrieval of the same information in each of that week’s lessons &lt;show slide 4&gt;. You can see that I actually gave pupils most of the sentence, and they only needed to fill out the date. This is because I wanted to really focus their thinking on the dates, as these were the key pieces of information I wanted them to retain.

The final thing pupils needed before accessing the new content was to understand the concepts of Capitalism and Communism &lt;show slide 5&gt;, and the differences between them, in order to begin to understand why people in the USA may fear Communism. In my experience, pupils tend to arrive in year 10 with a vague understanding in this area, and often carry some misconceptions, such as Capitalism being synonymous with democracy. In order to bring every pupil to a similar understanding, we read about the two systems and then categorised their economic and political features. Again you can see that I have highlighted some of the key points in the text to focus pupil thinking towards the key elements of the concepts. I added questions on the key differences to the retrieval quizzes I used for the remainder of the week, again to secure this specific knowledge in pupils’ long-term memories.

With all of this foundational knowledge now secure, I felt confident that the burden on their working memories would be reduced when we moved on to encounter new knowledge.

The new knowledge I wanted pupils to learn was largely dictated by the exam specification &lt;show slide 6&gt;. Pupils needed to understand how events outside of the USA in the half decade or so after World War Two led to an increase in the fear of Communism inside the USA.

However, before explaining how I linked this new knowledge to pupils’ prior knowledge, I want to give one very specific example of the precise knowledge that I identified pupils needed. I focused in very specifically on the term ‘Red Scare’ &lt;show slide 7&gt;, as I wanted pupils to have a clear understanding of its meaning. I used a visual image from the period to demonstrate attitudes towards Communism in the USA and explained that ‘Red’ was used as a shorthand for Communism and Communists, before we wrote a working definition of the term ‘Red Scare’ that pupils could refer to throughout this section of content.

I finally turned to teaching pupils about the events outside of the USA that drove increased fear of Communism. &lt;show slide 8&gt; Focusing on the first series of events, the Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe, we returned to what pupils already knew about World War Two in Europe. Pupils recalled that Nazi Germany had been invaded from the West by the USA and Britain and from the East by the Soviet Union &lt;show slide 9&gt;. I was able to build on this knowledge to explain that many of the countries in Eastern Europe through which the Soviets had passed during the invasion of Germany stayed under Soviet control in the immediate post-war years, and that by 1950 many of them had Communist governments which were installed and supported by the Soviet Union &lt;show slide 10&gt;. The general, foundational understanding that pupils had of the USSR’s role in the defeat of Nazi Germany and the geography of the conflict in Europe supported their ability to assimilate the more detailed information about which countries became communist and how this divided Europe between a capitalist West and communist East. We were then able to drill down further, looking at specific events in 1948 and 1949, like the Berlin Blockade and Airlift, the partition of Germany and the creation of NATO.

&lt;End slide show, back to talking head&gt;To sum up, I secured the knowledge that pupils had previously learned about World War Two by checking their recall of key facts and dates about the conflict, re-teaching it as necessary and testing it. I also explicitly taught the key features of, and differences between, Capitalism and Communism in order to overturn some potential misconceptions. I then built on this foundational knowledge by clarifying and defining the term ‘Red Scare’, and then introducing new knowledge about Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe with reference to what pupils already knew about World War Two in Europe and how the conflict had ended.

Consider the following questions

1. **What existing knowledge and vocabulary did the pupils need to have in order to be able to access and understand the new idea or concept?**
2. **What are the key ideas and concepts that Lee wanted his pupils to learn?**
3. **How did he link these key ideas and concepts to the pupils’ prior knowledge?**

As Lee explained, when planning his unit of work, he selected a number of key facts, essential concepts and skills that he wanted to ensure that pupils would be able to commit to their long-term memory. If pupils have a secure number of key components committed to memory, it means they can call upon them to support their thinking as the complexity of the learning increases. Through his planning he was able to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and master these critical components, and he ensured that he focused his pupils’ thinking on these key historical ideas.

Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if the new ideas are introduced too quickly. It is important to ensure that the necessary foundational knowledge is secure, as Lee did, so that critical thinking or problem solving can be developed.

In the next session we will look at ways to introduce new knowledge to pupils that do not overload the working memory, and thus help to avoid the development of misconceptions.

Reflect on your learning from this session by considering how you have introduced new ideas or concepts to your pupils to date.

### How Pupils Learn

2.1 Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.

2.2 Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.

2.3 An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.

2.4 Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.

2.5 Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.

_2a. Taking into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce._

_2c. Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content)._

_2e. Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known)._

### Subject and Curriculum

_3a. Identifying essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject and providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master these critical components._

_3b. Ensuring pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject._

### Classroom practice

This session will take **approximately** **60 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

For knowledge to be processed into the long-term memory, it is important not to overload the working memory when introducing new learning to pupils. In this session you will explore two methods of introducing new knowledge:

- Breaking complex material into smaller steps
- Combining verbal and graphical representation.

## Considering how to introduce new knowledge to pupils

Once you have considered what pupils need to know in order to access the topic, you can start to consider _how_ to introduce new information to your pupils. The most effective way to introduce new ideas is to break complex material into smaller steps and teach these steps one-by-one. This can be considered at a topic level, whereby the teacher breaks down the different knowledge and skills required, teaches them discreetly across the topic or unit, then brings them together once pupils are proficient at each. This will be explored as part of Module 6 – How Can You Plan A Coherent Curriculum.

For the purpose of this module, we are going to consider it from the perspective of a single explanation. This refers to breaking down complex ideas or tasks into smaller steps. This supports the amount of information being handled by the working memory as it reduces the number of ‘slots’ you are filling with new information to process. It also supports you as the teacher to assess pupils’ understanding after each step. If pupils have not understood, you can reteach or modify the explanation as required.

Breaking down complex ideas into smaller steps is a difficult task, even for experienced teachers, and it takes time to consider what the steps are. It requires both subject knowledge and pedagogical knowledge; you need to consider what the logical steps are for the subject matter and the amount of information that your pupils will be able to handle (based on their age and experience in the topic).

An example of how a complex idea could be broken into smaller steps can be seen below. This maths example is taken the Doug Lemov’s book ‘Teach Like a Champion 2.0’ (2015). When teaching pupils to round numbers to a given place value, the following steps can be used:

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Think carefully about the example above and make notes on the following questions:

    <strong>
      Why does breaking the explanation down into these five steps avoid
      overloading the working memory?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      What prior knowledge is the teacher assuming the pupils have?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Would the explanation be different if the pupils were already proficient
      at a number of the steps?

    <strong>
      What else would breaking the explanation down into these steps support the
      teacher to do?

## Mentor Interaction

In you next mentor interaction, your explanations will be observed. You will then be asked to practise breaking a concept or idea down into smaller steps with your mentor for the lesson you taught, or an upcoming concept.

When creating your steps in preparation for this observation, it is helpful to consider:

1. What knowledge am I assuming the pupils have?
2. Why have I chosen the steps that I have? Would it be beneficial to break them down further?
3. Even after breaking down the concept, am I introducing too much in one go and risking overloading my pupils? If so, what can I do?

## Combing verbal and graphical representations

Another way to support learning is by combining verbal explanations and graphical representations. You may hear this referred to in educational research as the principle of Dual Coding.

Why is this a useful strategy when introducing new knowledge to pupils?

Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant diagram or visual representation reduces the load on the working memory as it makes use of both the visual and auditory paths in the brain. It is particularly useful when the concept is hierarchical, such as an organisational structure, or has organisations and connections that are not linear (Caviglioli, 2019).

$Figure
$Alt Diagram shows the relationship between working and long-term memory, with information being recalled from long-term to working memory when needed and processed into long-term for storage. Environmental factors also input into working memory. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Simplest-model-of-the-mind.jpg $EndURL $Caption Willingham (2009) $EndCaption
$EndFigure

This course took advantage of this principle when you were introduced to the Willingham model of the mind. As the concept is not linear and relies on the relationship between the different elements of the mind, if this model was explained using only text, the concept would have been harder to explain and understand.

Listen to teacher Jon Hutchinson talk about how he has learnt to effectively combine verbal explanations and graphical representation in order to support teaching and learning.

So we know that information is processed by pupils through a few different sensory inputs. The two main ones being the auditory and the visual inputs and those different sensors have different advantages and disadvantages so through auditory input we have a linear explanation. It can be very rich but it also means that we're limited by that linear nature whereas if we present something visually we're able to present that information in a non-linear way so we can show organizations in connections that we might not be able to do so easily in an auditory way. And so we want to capitalise on the way that dual coding can help us embed the information that we want pupils to learn in a more robust and sophisticated way. And so we capitalized on a few different ways one of which is we hugely cut down on the extraneous load that we expect, that we put on pupils so I know that I used to put lots and lots of text on the board when I was teaching a topic, especially one I wasn't confident on, mainly because I wanted to read it off the board but we know that's likely to really overload the pupils and they can't process both their own internal auditory voice from reading the text and listening to me and so that will result in cognitive overload so we now use just key images when we're using slideshows and presentations and the explanation will come from the teacher. That might mean that what was on the board gets printed off so that the teacher can read it out over the image. So that when people see that sort of image, or imagine that sort of concrete example, they bring back to mind the rich explanation the teacher gave as well.

And the second way is presenting the information in a synchronous way so that's just especially helpful for things like hierarchies for things like cause relations often come up in things like history, how the First World War was caused, that the acronym that we often use there is main militaries of militarism alliances, imperialism and nationalism, and how do those different sorts of causal relationships connect with the start of the First World War best present that through some sort of an image or a flow diagram so that pupils can appreciate that relationship. Within geography we’ll have lots of processes, the water cycle for example, again best presented that relationship through a visual, through some sort of visual stimulus in which the arrows can point out the particular nature of the of the relationship and so we'll think about the best way to present that information and try and utilise both the visual and the auditory senses as they go through.

In the video, Jon shared some examples of how his school have combined verbal explanations and relevant graphics to support pupils’ understanding of new knowledge. The Early Career Framework highlights that the graphics must be ‘relevant’, and that simply combining any image with your explanation will not be effective. The graphic must serve a function and help support pupils to process information quickly.

## Session Overview

In the previous session we looked at effective strategies to introduce new knowledge to pupils. The aim of these strategies is to avoid overloading their working memory, therefore giving pupils a better chance of learning and remembering the information. This session will explore a further method to achieve the same goal:

- Using worked and partially completed examples

## Using worked and partially completed examples

A worked example is a problem that has already been solved for the pupil, with every step fully explained and clearly shown. The beauty of a worked example is that they make visible an expert’s problem-solving solution, and then this is shared with the novice pupil as an example to learn from.

They also free up the pupil’s working memory by shifting the focus from finding the correct answer to understanding and learning the steps in the example. This means that they are more likely to recall how to solve this type of problem when they are faced with it in the future (NSW DfE, 2017).
When you are creating a worked example, you are not aiming to reduce the complexity of the knowledge being learnt and remove any of the academic rigor around it. The knowledge will remain complex and pupils will need to partake in effortful thinking in order to understand it. But worked examples are effective at removing any extraneous information and distractions that would stop pupils being able to think deeply about each step of the process. With the support of the example they can focus instead on the content and exactly how an expert would solve it.

Effective worked examples often share the following features:

- They offer a clear structure and reasoning behind the steps shown.
- They take pupils through the problem to its logical conclusion without any step being left to interpretation.
- The teacher talks through their reasoning, sharing their expert thinking and understanding.
- After studying a worked example, learners require practise on their own to provide them with feedback on whether they have learned it or not.

Partially completed examples are worked examples that have had some steps left blank for pupils to complete. They allow the teacher to direct the pupil to where the practise needs to take place. The idea behind a partially completed example is that you are directing pupils to where you want them to focus their thinking.

And in this module, I'm going to talk with you about a particularly useful insight from cognitive science around creating something called a ‘worked example’ and why it can be so useful to you as a teacher.

So let me start first with a very simple definition of what a worked example is. A worked example is simply a step by step explanation of how to solve a problem. That may seem obvious and sound like easy to do but it's actually quite interesting to explore how to do it effectively as a teacher. And rather than talk about that in the abstract I thought I'd take a bit of a chance here and actually try to create a worked example here in this video with you around solving crossword puzzles. Now I know immediately some of you just groaned and have, what, nothing to do with this and a few of you might also already love doing puzzles and this might seem a bit redundant so I apologize to both of you but trust me I think if we explore this together you'll find it interesting and think about how it can apply to situations, anything you might want to teach. But I actually think crossword puzzles contain an awful lot within them that help explain our cognitive architecture and I'll explain that as we go along.

Ok so let me start by saying if I wanted to teach you how to solve a crossword puzzle what would I not do, what would be a bad example? Well, one thing that I certainly wouldn't do is give you a bunch of crossword puzzles with the clues already filled in and say study these. That, I think, would probably not improve your performance in solving crossword puzzles at all and the reason for that is you're not actually going to be learning a strategy for how to solve the problem. You're going to be learning at best what some of the answers to some clues are but unless the puzzle contains that same clue again it's really not going to be very helpful. So worked examples are not just about giving students the answer, it's really about figuring out a process and making it very explicit what that process is so that students can use that to sort of alleviate their cognitive burden when they're solving a problem that may appear new and novel to them.

So let's dive in, let's say for now that I'm going to try to teach you, give you, a worked example for solving a crossword. So here's the first thing that I'd start with I'd look for all the clues that are what I call ‘fill in the blank’. Here's an example: let's say in the crossword we're doing three across is PRIME blank now my guess is many of you immediately started thinking of what could follow this PRIME. I suspect many of you immediately thought ‘Minister’ a few of you who are hungry may think ‘rib’ and perhaps a few Star Trek aficionados thought directive, but my guess is for those of you are in the UK, Minister is the first thing that came to mind so let's just take a look here. We've got a box with I believe eight letters I'm just gonna see if that fits. Good idea to usually do this in pencil but low and behold: Boom! Minister. Great, so that would be step one and it's worth thinking about just for a second why would we want to start with blanks like that and the answer is, my opinion, the creator of the puzzle has actually made your cognitive load a little bit easier by giving you half the information you need already. For whatever reason, those sort of clues are usually the ones that people immediately go to because again it doesn't tax as much of our memory and our consciousness as some of the other clues will, which we'll come to in a second. So, we might go through the puzzle see all of the fill in the blanks see how many of those we can solve but what will we do next? Well, we might then turn to attacking the three-letter clues. So, let's for example look at one that I've created for this puzzle. 17 down has ‘TV in the UK’. Think about that for a second. Right, you've got it right I'm sure many of you immediately thought BBC. Now why would we start with attacking the three-letter clues? Well, it's because there's only three letters. And so again we're looking for ways to make puzzles easier for us to think through rather than more challenging. So, starting with the three-letter clues after the fill in the blank should help us fill in the puzzle in ways that will make it a little bit less taxing on the cognitive process that we're doing. Now again we are doing effortful thinking that's good and we're pulling things from our memory into our working memory in order to solve these clues.

One thing I will just note for crossword puzzles too is if there's little things you might learn or put into your worked example like clues that have acronyms in them typically have acronyms as their solutions. It's things like that when you're starting to teach somebody something that you want to make that very explicit. You can allow them to discover it on their own by doing this over and over again but why not make it easier up front? In time they will learn it and then it will become sort of their background knowledge but it's really important with a worked example or frankly when teaching anything to try to be as explicit as you can when first introducing a concept to a pupil.

So now we've populated our puzzle with a few solutions we can look at it and see where do we have what I call ‘first letters’ and that is what I mean where some of the letters that we've filled in give us the first letter for one of the other clues. So let's just imagine for a second that there's this clue, five down, and it says ‘luxurious autos’. Now if you're like me you might immediately think, ok, Mercedes Benz you drop down and it's like ooh that's promising that looks like a lot of letters. Looks like about eleven here but you try to type Mercedes or write Mercedes and that doesn't fit and or say Mercedes Benz is too long. Hmm! Have a look - it’s tough right? Now, what if I told you that our Prime Minister solution crossed with this and so that we actually know the first letter in this. The first letter is ‘R’. Gotta think for a second. My guess is that a lot of you just thought of the answer to this. The answer is Rolls Royces. How elegant is that? Of course, they break down a lot but this is not to disparage British engineering. So, this is a worked example that I've rapidly created here of how I might teach people to solve crossword puzzles. Look for fill in the blanks, attack the three-letter and then find first letters. Now here's the thing about teaching -there's a lot of different ways in which I could have created a worked example for crossword puzzles. There's no one way to do it. The key is to think about why it's important to step through all the processes for your students and to understand that for them encountering new things like this are gonna be things they might naturally resist and that we're actually trying to alleviate as much as we can in the early stage of something, the cognitive effort that it takes and that's the joy of teaching is that there is no one way of doing that and for basically everything that you might teach you're gonna be responsible for figuring out and imagining how to create a worked example like this to help your students.

Worked examples are a hugely important part of the learning process. They offer a model of expert thinking and processing and they demonstrate how an expert would apply their knowledge when working to answer a question.

They are also beneficial as they give the teacher an insight into their pupils’ perspective when faced with solving a new problem. It can be difficult to know how to answer a question or effectively break down a task if it isn’t something you’ve worked through and completed yourself. As a teacher you should be considering your pupil’s prior knowledge and then tailor the worked example to be built on this and accessible to them. There’s also the old danger of providing worked examples that aren’t replicable. There’s no end of teachers who have spent an hour writing a worked example to a question that a pupil has 20 minutes to answer, meaning that the quantity and quality of the response isn’t actually a replicable model. You will course naturally take a little longer to create the example to ensure it includes everything you want to demonstrate and ensure it is designed in a way that will alleviate some of the load placed on the working memory however, as the expert, it shouldn’t take you much longer to create than it would take your pupils to answer.

Worked examples can be introduced at almost any point as a learning tool, but I typically use them in English once the class are secure in all the foundational concepts and then I used the worked example as a way of demonstrating how to pull all that learning together. I like to think about them almost as an apprenticeship model:

<ul>
  <li>Here’s a beautiful example</li>
  <li>Here’s a master crafting a beautiful example</li>
  <li>
    Let’s work through the process of crafting a beautiful example together
  </li>
  <li>Now you create a beautiful example and I’m here to help if needed</li>
  <li>Now you create a beautiful example independently</li>
</ul>
In the example shared below, it is important to know the class were already familiar
with the topic. We’d been working on the opening of ‘An Inspector Calls’ for a few
weeks, and they knew the characters, the opening of the narrative and so on. With
this in mind, and a secure foundation of knowledge on which to build, I felt a worked
example would help me demonstrate how they could pull all this learning together
when answering an exam question.

The worked example was actually written by a very able pupil from the previous year, and expertly demonstrated the learning points I needed the class to pick up. The dissection shown underneath the example shares the focus and rationale for each step of the process. It’s structured as an effective paragraph (a clear point, valid evidence that’s embedded, explanation and analysis with a zoom in on a specific word, some technical terminology, a link to the whole text). I talked through this with the class, sharing my thoughts on why this is such an excellent example at each stage. Following on from this, we would create a further example together, then the pupils would attempt an example independently. At this point I can see what steps in the process individuals have remembered. At other times, I’d produce the initial model myself, but I’d very much want to ensure that it’s of a practical, replicable quality and length.

<h3>Worked Example</h3>
At the beginning of the play, Priestley presents the inspector as an enigmatic, almost
wilfully nondescript figure. After all, the description of him wearing a ‘plain darkish
suit’ contrasts sharply with the ‘tails and white ties’ worn by the Birling men,
just as the inspector’s habit of speaking ‘carefully, weightily’ contrasts with Birling’s
speech-making, despite his claim that he doesn’t ‘often make speeches at you’. Priestley
clearly intends the inspector to be juxtaposed with Birling. The two are both male
and of an age, but their behaviour is as significantly different as their appearance
– Birling is ‘heavy-looking, but it is the inspector’s ideas and language that allow
him to speak ‘weightily’. There is, in addition, nothing specific about the inspector’s
clothing or appearance, just as there is very little sense of personality or clarity
in terms of his symbolic function at the beginning of the play, and the inspector’s
speech seems direct and purposeful, unlike Birling’s long-winded and opinionated
rant. Perhaps Priestley intends for the inspector to be defined through his function
rather than his ego, something of which Birling seems incapable.

<strong>Exam or teacher model-response dissected</strong>

Point:

At the beginning of the play, Priestley presents the inspector as an enigmatic, almost wilfully nondescript figure.

Evidence:

After all, the description of him wearing a ‘plain darkish suit’ contrasts sharply with the ‘tails and white ties’ worn by the Birling men, just as the inspector’s habit of speaking ‘carefully, weightily’ contrasts with Birling’s speech-making, despite his claim that he doesn’t ‘often make speeches at you’.

Explanation/analysis:

Priestley clearly intends the inspector to be juxtaposed with Birling. The two are both male and of an age, but their behaviour is as significantly different as their appearance – Birling is ‘heavy-looking, but it is the inspector’s ideas and language that allow him to speak ‘weightily’.

$Content
A partially completed example is similar to a worked example, but with some information missing. It is used to help reduce cognitive load when pupils are learning new content or a new skill. It is a form of scaffolding to develop expertise as it allows the pupils to add to the answer themselves, developing the explanation of a key concept. I would use this strategy at a point in pupils learning where they had previously seen a fully worked example, or as a scaffold for a task.

I recently used it to support pupils in a task where the outcome was to explain the formation of erosional coastal features. At the beginning of the lesson, I verbally explained the formation of a wave cut platform and supported my explanation with photographs and relevant diagrams. I used the acronym SPED which stands for: Sequence, Process, Explanation and Description as this helps to break the answer down into smaller components. Throughout the explanation, I checked for pupil understanding through questioning. Once I was satisfied that pupils were ready to begin, I explained the task to them.

They were given a partially completed explanation of the formation of erosional coastal features and were asked to complete it. This involved developing some points further and including additional detail that was missing. The level of detail missing varied for different pupils according to their current understanding on the topic. This ensured that pupils were able to focus their learning on key points without experiencing working memory overload. It developed pupil’s understanding as they were required to identify what was missing from the partially completed example and therefore understand what is needed to give a full geographical answer.

When planning this activity, I began by creating a good explanation that followed the structure of SPED and contained fully developed points. I then removed the information that I wanted the pupils to practice recalling. This ensured their recall focused on key learning points and skills that we had been working to develop.

This session will take **approximately 80 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

In this session, you will explore how the long-term memory is organised, and how to support your pupils to remember the knowledge that is taught to them.

The session will focus on:

- building strong mental models in the long-term memory
- retrieval and strengthening of knowledge

## Helping pupils to remember

While we process information in our working memory, our long-term memory is where knowledge is stored. It is thought that the long-term memory changes and expands as pupils integrate new ideas with existing knowledge. However, that does not mean that we remember everything that we process in our working memory. Over time, the chances of forgetting a memory increase.

Understanding how information is stored in the long-term memory can help you plan how to effectively retrieve and practise key knowledge. This next section is going to look at the storage system of the long-term memory, also called ‘mental models’.

## Mental Models

When the mind is presented with new information, it searches the long-term memory for any prior knowledge that will support with the understanding and processing of the concept. If the mind finds some useful knowledge to support the working memory, then the newly acquired knowledge is added to an ever-growing web of information around this topic. We refer to these interconnected webs as ‘mental models’, or you may hear them referred to as ‘schemata’.

The diagrams below represent two mental models. The dots represent pieces of information and the lines represent links between the pieces of knowledge. The first diagram shows a well-developed, organised mental model of a topic. When a new piece of information is added, it will be processed and understood in relation to the existing information and links.

Where the mental model is less developed (diagram 2), the knowledge may exist in isolation. Where this is the case, the information is less embedded into memory, meaning that it is weaker and more likely to be forgotten. It is also much more likely to be misunderstood, and in turn, it is likely that misconceptions will develop around the information.

$EndFigure

The information organised into diagram 1 will be more securely stored in the long-term memory, and pupils will be able to recall it more quickly when needed. Not only will this help with a pupil’s ability to process new information, but secure subject knowledge will support with the levels of engagement and motivation experienced by the pupil. When a pupil understands what is being taught to them quickly, feels confident in giving answers, and experiences success, this will likely lead to an increase in confidence, motivation and enjoyment in the learning. It is therefore important to think carefully about the key knowledge and foundational concepts that you want pupils to master before moving on, ensuring that pupils have secure prior knowledge to which they can link their learning.

So, what can you do as a teacher to help pupils develop an organised mental model around a topic, and ensure that the knowledge held within them is not forgotten? The next section looks at ways of strengthening the recall of knowledge.

## Strengthening the recall of knowledge

How quickly a piece of knowledge can be recalled when needed depends on two factors:

1. Its **retrieval strength** - retrieval strength refers to how easily you can retrieve a piece of knowledge from your working memory. As a teacher, you want knowledge to have a high retrieval strength, so that your pupils can recall facts easily.
2. Its **storage strength** - storage strength is how embedded or connected a memory is in your mind. As a teacher you want knowledge to have a high storage strength so that the memory does not fade over time.

Your aim would be to support pupils to have knowledge that has a **high retrieval strength** and a **high storage strength**. This means that pupils would be quick to recall knowledge when asked a question about it (high retrieval strength), and would be able to remember it in two months’ time when they needed to use the knowledge again (high storage strength).

An example of a memory that has high retrieval and high storage strength is your current address. Regardless of when or where you were asked for your address, you would be able to tell someone what it was without hesitation.

$Figure

$EndFigure

In the classroom you may teach a lesson on a concept or topic and assess it at the end of the lesson with a large success rate. A couple of weeks later, the same assessment is likely to lead to a much lower success rate, as pupil’s memory has moved from being highly retrievable to less so. The memory that the pupils have of the learning had an initially high retrieval strength, but it was not thoroughly embedded in the long-term memory and therefore had a low storage strength.

The question for teachers is, how do you create a memory that is high storage and has a high retrieval rate, effectively converting thinking into long term learning?

To answer this, let’s go back and consider why your current address might easily retrieved and easily retained. The answer is because of the number of times you have repeated it, how often you have recalled it into your working memory, and how many times you have practised writing it down or explaining it to someone. You have recalled this information many times, increasing the storage strength, so that when asked, you can retrieve the information in a flash.

This principle should be applied to the learning of any key knowledge or concepts that you want your pupils to retain. It is important that you build in regular time in your lessons for pupils to practise and repeat what has been previously taught, retrieving the critical knowledge from their long-term memory. If you do not build in this additional practice, the knowledge will become weak, and pupils will not be able to recall the information when it is needed. Throughout this early career framework course, you will see this principle in action: concepts are purposefully returned to in order to increase the retrieval and storage strength in your long-term memory and help you embed them as part of your everyday teaching practice.

In the next section we will explore effective strategies that will support with the retrieval of key information.

lesson but low storage rate when you returned to the concept later in the term? What

## Building mental models

In this section we will explore strategies for how you can support the recall and retrieval of knowledge and build well-developed mental models in pupils to support deeper understanding of concepts and topics.

### Strategy 1: Building on prior knowledge

Session 1 of this module looked at the importance of linking new learning to pupils’ prior knowledge as a strategy to avoid overloading the working memory. The importance of doing this is highlighted further in this section by recognising that building on prior knowledge also leads to a more developed mental model. This means that when a new piece of information is added to the model, it will be processed and understood in relation to the existing information. The more linked the knowledge is within the mental model, the more likely it is for the pupil to retain the information.

It is important to note that for most topics taught in schools, pupils will come with an existing mental model. This model, however, may be small or unorganised, and will most likely contain large knowledge gaps and misconceptions. This makes your pupils novices in the concepts and knowledge to be learned. As the teacher, you will have a relatively developed mental model in the topic, making you an expert. This is an important distinction, as novices and experts think and learn about concepts in a different way. For novices, the gaps in knowledge need to be identified and content explicitly taught so that the teacher can be sure that strong foundations are in place, and mental models can develop in an organised way. Lessons should be sequenced carefully so that the foundational knowledge around a concept is secure, before encountering more complex content. Where this does not happen, the teacher may be building on unstable foundations, leading to further misconceptions later. As an expert in the topic, it is easy for teachers to underestimate the amount of explicit teaching and practice required for what may appear a relatively simple concept. An expert can quickly absorb and make sense of new information, hanging it on existing knowledge. However, for novice learners to process information into their long-term memory takes considerable teaching, practice and revisiting.

### Strategy 2: Spaced exposition and practice

A further way to support the recall and retrieval of knowledge and build a well-developed mental model is through spaced exposition and practice. Spaced practice means that opportunities to review information previously taught are integrated into the curriculum at spaced intervals.

Studies have shown that pupils remember much more when they have been exposed to information on two occasions, rather than just one (Pashler et al, 2007). Spacing practice increases the storage and retrieval strength of the information, making it more readily recalled into the working memory for problem solving.

Here is an example of a medium-term plan for Year 9 History. The teacher has thought carefully about the sequence in which the knowledge will be introduced to pupils. Within the plan they have also outlined what the spaced practice focus will be each week. You can see that the topic ‘The Treaty of Versailles’ will be covered a total of three times, ensuring a better chance of high storage and retrieval strength and a more developed mental model around this topic.

[KS4 History Medium Term Plan](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/M2-Example-of-NET-curriculum-Y9-mid-term-plan.pdf)

### Strategy 3: Retrieval practice

The final strategy is to use retrieval practice to support the automatic recall of key knowledge. Retrieval practice is different from simply revisiting the material. Instead, pupils are asked to recall knowledge from their memory. Some levels of forgetting are inevitable, however forgetting some of the information and then trying to recall it actually strengthens the eventual learning. Creating regular opportunities in lesson time for pupils to recall information from previous lessons will support them to build long-term memory and will allow you as the teacher to check what pupils are remembering, and if any misconceptions have developed.

An effective method of providing retrieval opportunities is through low-stakes quizzes. These are simple to create, quick for the pupils to complete, and the answers can be shared immediately for instant feedback. It also allows you to draw questions from the previous lesson, or further back in the unit.

An example of a simple low-stakes retrieval quiz can be found below. As you can see, it focuses thinking on the key knowledge that the teacher wants pupils to recall.

Further on in my teaching of the module ‘USA 1945-75’ with my year 10 GCSE history class, we came to focus on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. When completing their assessments on the previous topic of the Red Scare, many of my pupils had struggled to recall and therefore use their contextual knowledge when answering questions as I had not been systematic in my use of retrieval. I reflected that I therefore needed to be more systematic both in identifying the key items of knowledge in this new topic that would underpin pupils’ understanding, and in my use of regular retrieval practice throughout the topic to encode this knowledge in their long-term memories.

The main resource I used to teach this Civil Rights topic was the course textbook &lt;show slide 1&gt;, which had a series of double page spreads, similar to this one, focused on a key aspect of the movement. The bulk of time in the first lesson on each aspect was taken up reading one of these spreads, and highlighting, clarifying and summarising the events, people and concepts described. Therefore, I selected the key knowledge I wanted pupils to retain from these spreads when planning lessons, cross-referencing this with the exam specification’s ‘specific content’ to ensure I was selecting the most important information.

I could then write a set of low-stakes quiz questions for each aspect of the topic &lt;show slide 2&gt;, which in this example was the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown vs. Board of Education that led to segregation in schools in the USA being declared unconstitutional. After the first lesson on this aspect I set these questions as homework for the pupils to revise. Each subsequent lesson on this aspect then began with the same 10-15 questions. As you can see, the questions are quite detailed and only require short answers. This, combined with asking them in the same order each time, initially provided support for pupils to experience a high success rate when retrieving this information.

The impact of this was clear, as you can see from this record of pupils’ scores in the quizzes &lt;show slide 3&gt;. I set the expectation that pupils would master 100% of this content during the sequence of lessons on this particular aspect, re-testing specific pupils at break times and lunch times if necessary.

&lt;show slide 4&gt; Once this content was mastered, I was keen to ensure both that pupils retained it beyond the specific sequence of lessons in which they had learnt it, and that I increased the challenge with practice and retrieval as their knowledge became more secure. To do this, I collapsed the knowledge covered in the original 10 quiz questions into a single task, which I asked pupils to complete at the end of two separate lessons on the next aspect of the topic, which was the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This task is less scaffolded than the set of quiz questions, requiring them to select independently the items of knowledge that would form the list of main events of the Brown vs. Board case.

Secondly, to increase the challenge further, once we had covered the entire sequence of events that made up the campaign for civil rights in the 1950s, I prompted pupils to recall the main events of the entire decade on a single timeline. This both increased the amount of knowledge pupils were asked to retrieve and again forced them to select and sequence a series of events.

The effect of this use of retrieval was obvious in pupils’ performance in their subsequent assessment &lt;show slide 5&gt;. Where previously pupils used little contextual knowledge in their answers, now they were able to draw on the knowledge of events, people and concepts securely stored in their long-term memory. The highlighted yellow text represents the specific contextual knowledge used by the same pupil in their previous assessment on the left, when little or no systematic retrieval was used, and in their post-retrieval assessment on the right. And this effect was clear on the whole class level too as the average class grade increased across the two assessments where retrieval was employed.

As pupil knowledge became more secure, Lee began to increase the challenge of the retrieval practice by asking pupils to instead apply their knowledge to a task. With the knowledge held within the mental model now being so secure, he felt confident that the pupils could create new links to strengthen the model further.

Developing a well-curated retrieval quiz is something you will explore with your mentor during your next training session.
As pupils become more secure in their knowledge and their mental model becomes more developed, you should be able to increase the intervals between the spaced practice and increase the level of challenge of the retrieval task.

## Research into how pupils learn

When you entered the teaching profession, you came with your own established mental model of what ‘teaching’ and ‘how pupils learn’ looked like. The content of this module may be building on prior knowledge in your mental model, and you may feel confident to apply the content directly to your practice with the support of your mentor. Alternatively, the content may be new learning, and you feel that there will be some retrieval of the concepts needed. You will have the opportunity to speak to your mentor weekly about the knowledge covered in this module and attend two training sessions that look in more detail at elements of the key knowledge.

The aim of this module is to share with you the most recent research on how pupils learn best. It is important to acknowledge that claims of strategies based on the mind and how pupils learn are not new. In the recent past, some of these strategies have not been based on robust evidence, resulting in teacher practice that does not always have maximum impact for pupils. However, some of these strategies may be very familiar to you and your colleagues, and they may even be established in your mental model of what a ‘teacher’ does.

Listen again to Ben Riley, CEO of Deans for Impact, talking about why it is important for teachers to have a mental model that contains knowledge of research driven teaching methods, and how to work with your colleagues to implement these into the wider school practice.

$Summary

$Content
I want to talk to you about mental models and why it's important for teachers to have a mental model of their students that incorporates our best scientific understanding of how students think and learn. My friend Dan Willingham, the cognitive scientist, said has this phrase he uses which is that ‘every teacher, whether implicitly or explicitly, has a theory of how learning takes place with their students’. So if you think about it when a teacher does something, some action, they're intending for something to happen on the part of their students that will lead to some sort of learning outcome and really what we want and what I think the early career frameworks in the UK have done so admirably is to say that we want that theory to be our best available scientific one and to not use unscientific theories in our teaching.

But now I want to talk about a theory of learning that's widely prevalent but unfortunately doesn't have the support of our scientific inquiries and that's learning styles. Now I may trigger a few people here, so I just want you to bear with me. So, the theory of learning styles, is that different people learn more effectively depending on having that information presented in the way they would prefer. So you may have heard people say well I'm a visual learner. You may even think of yourself as a visual learner. Other people might say I'm an audio learner, I learn best by listening to something, and still others might say I'm a kinesthetic learner I learn best by moving around.

It's a completely plausible theory. A lot of people have it. You may even have it. Here's the thing: we've studied it, we've looked at it, not just once not just twice but over and over and over again and as best we can tell using scientific inquiry there's just very little evidence that presenting someone information in their preferred style is at all effective in helping them improve their learning. I know that that doesn't sound right. We think that we must learn a certain way and we know that we like these ways but here's the deal: often our intuitions about learning can be mistaken. I mean this is really why the tools of cognitive science are so important for teachers because we might have all these beliefs about what we think works but we really want to turn and rely on what we've studied and investigated time and again and use that to inform our mental model of what’s taking place with our students. That's what's going to be more effective for them and frankly make it easier for you.

So going forward if you investigate this if you come around to the position that I again would submit to you is scientifically supported which is that learning styles is not a particularly effective strategy to use with your students what happens when you start hearing some of your teaching colleagues who believe firmly in that. Let me just say that I have found in my life that it's not particularly effective to say ‘well, you're wrong and the science says so’. What you instead might want to try it see if you can shift the topic a bit and say you know I've been really interested in this dual coding approach to learning and I've been trying it with some of my students and let's investigate that together and maybe by working together with your colleagues you can give them a new mental model of how to approach their teaching. You don't try to just disprove something that they may already believe but you instead create an alternative possibility they can employ. That's what I think makes effective educating. Often it's not so much about you need to know this or else you're, you know, ill-advised or dare I say stupid, but instead trying to give people something new that they can use and find powerful in their own teaching and in their own life so I don't know if this module could rise that high but I hope you found it somewhat helpful and I hope you have encoded it. Thanks.

### How Pupils Learn

2.5 Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.

2.6 Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly.

2.7 Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.

2.8 Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall.

_2h. Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills._

_2i. Planning regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time._

_2j. Designing practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting challenging work._

_2k. Increasing challenge with practice and retrieval as knowledge becomes more secure (e.g. by removing scaffolding, lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements)._

### Subject and Curriculum

3.2 Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively.

3.3 Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.

3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

_3i. Providing tasks that support pupils to learn key ideas securely (e.g. quizzing pupils so they develop fluency with times tables)._

_3j. Using retrieval and spaced practice to build automatic recall of key knowledge._

### Adaptive Teaching

5.6 There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Managing Behaviour

_7m. Supporting pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals._

### Professional behaviours

_8d. Engaging critically with research and discussing evidence with colleagues._

## Introduction to Metacognition and self-regulation

Research has found that metacognition and self-regulation are important for pupil learning. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) have found that when harnessed effectively, these strategies can improve attainment of disadvantaged learners (EEF, 2018). Therefore, it is important to explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies linked to their subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate their work. This short session will aim to give you an introduction to metacognition and self-regulation, which will be built upon during your next mentor interaction.

### Self-regulation

Self-regulation concerns the extent to which learners are aware of their strengths, weaknesses, and the strategies they use to learn.

In their[ guidance report](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf), the EEF (2018) state that cognition and metacognition are important parts of self-regulation.

### Cognition

Simply put, cognition is thinking. It’s the mental process of knowing, understanding and learning (EEF, 2018). A good way to understand what cognition is, is to think of it as pupils thinking through a cognitive strategy. Pupils will learn many cognitive strategies when at school, and they will be subject specific. For example, if in maths pupils need to solve multiplication, they might have different cognitive strategies for doing so, such as using times tables, the box method, or long multiplication. These different strategies for solving multiplication are the pupils’ cognitive strategies that they draw upon when working independently to solve problems. All these strategies are important for the pupil to know. However, the pupil needs to understand which strategy would be best to apply when solving different problems. For example, using times table facts to solve 7 x 8 would be efficient, but using times table facts alone to solve 1365 x 189 would be much more challenging. Pupils need to decide which strategies they should use and when. That’s where metacognition comes in.

### Metacognition

Simply put, this is pupils thinking about their thinking (EEF, 2018). When approaching any task, pupils do so with metacognitive knowledge about:

- What the activity is asking them to do
- What cognitive strategies they could use
- Their own abilities and attitudes - knowledge of themselves as a learner

When undertaking a learning task, pupils start with this knowledge, then apply and adapt it. This is metacognitive regulation.

#### Metacognitive regulation

Metacognitive regulation is when pupils plan, monitor and evaluate their thinking using their metacognitive knowledge. The diagram below helps to illustrate this process:

$Figure
$Alt Metacognitive regulation occurs as a cyclical process. Pupils use their metacognitive knowledge to plan their cognitive strategy. Then they will monitor this strategy during use and evaluate it after, therefore improving their metacognition. $EndAlt $URL http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Metacognition-model-min-scaled.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption
$EndFigure

#### **Planning**

When approaching a task, effective metacognitive learners have knowledge of what the task is asking them to do, knowledge of the cognitive strategies they could use, and knowledge of their own ability. They should use this information to plan the best cognitive strategy to use.

#### Monitoring

When using a specific cognitive strategy during a task, pupils should monitor how effective that cognitive strategy is. If they find it unsuccessful, then they should try a different cognitive strategy.

#### Evaluating

Once pupils have completed the task, they should evaluate how successful they were, so they know which strategies to use next time. By doing this, they begin to learn from their own experiences and refine their approach to completing similar tasks.

$I

<h4>Example</h4>
To help make this clear, let’s link back to session 1 and the maths example we explored
when thinking about avoiding working memory overload. Imagine a pupil has been set
the question of solving 1365 x 189. Effective learners will apply metacognitive regulation
whilst answering that question. An example of their metacognitive thinking is shown
below:

<strong>Step 1: Planning:</strong>
First, the pupil examines the question. They can see its multiplication from the
operator symbol used. They know they are good at their times tables, so they decide
to use their times tables to work it out.

<strong>Step 2: Monitoring:</strong>
Second, when using their times tables, they become a little confused about which
numbers they have multiplied and which numbers they still have left. They think they
need to add some amounts together but are unsure. They realise that the strategy
isn’t very successful, so attempt to use long multiplication instead. They find this
strategy much easier because they can keep track of which numbers they have already
multiplied, and they are able to complete the question.

<strong>Step 3: Evaluating:</strong>
After the task, they reflect on their initial approach and decide that when trying
to multiply large numbers, they will use long multiplication rather than their times
tables.

<strong>Summary:</strong>
In the above example, the pupil has been able to self-regulate their learning. They
were able to acknowledge their own strengths and weaknesses when completing a task
and, as a result, identified which strategy is most successful for them when multiplying
large numbers together. When they come across a similar problem in the future, they
can use what they have learned to inform their choice of cognitive strategy. This
will refine their ability to solve this type of questions. $I

As you progress through the modules in this programme, sessions will return to the concept of self-regulation and metacognition several times. As you revisit and retrieve these concepts, the content within the modules will help build your knowledge of strategies that you can use to support the development of metacognition in your pupils.

## The importance of subject knowledge

> "Self-regulated learning and metacognition have often been found to be context-dependent, so how you best plan in Key Stage 2 art may have significant differences to planning strategies in GCSE maths.
>
> This means that a pupil who shows strong self-regulated learning and metacognitive competence in one task or subject domain may be weak in another, and metacognitive strategies may or may not be effective, depending on the specific task, subject, or problem tackled."
>
> (EEF (2018) pg24)

Pupils cannot use metacognition if they do not have a good understanding of the subject upon which the task is based. For example, if pupils do not understand what multiplication is, or only have one strategy to solve a multiplication problem, they will not be able to implement metacognitive regulation. In order to evaluate how successful a cognitive strategy is, pupils need to have sufficient knowledge of the strategy itself. They also need alternative strategies they can draw upon when one doesn’t work.
For expert learners, cognition and metacognition become largely unconscious and automatic, but in novice learners they are not. Therefore, it is important that teachers support pupils to use cognitive and metacognition strategies in all subjects across the curriculum. This is something that will be explored further with your mentor in your next session and will be explored in different modules throughout the programme.

## Review of previous learning

Rosenshine (2012) identifies ‘review of previous learning’ as an important part of instruction because it does two things that aid pupil learning: strengthens knowledge and builds fluency.

As you explored in module two, by recalling facts and information, pupils strengthen the connections of the material in their brain, making it easier for them to recall the information at subsequent times. Once this knowledge is effortlessly recalled, pupils have become fluent. This supports learners as it frees up working memory, preventing working memory overload and leaving more capacity for learning new material. This enables pupils to be more successful in their learning which is a key factor in developing intrinsic motivation.

In the classroom, a review can occur in many forms such as checking homework, going over work where there were errors, or practising retrieving knowledge so that it becomes automatic. The latter is more commonly known as retrieval practice - a strategy you explored in module two.

$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
Retrieval practice is something you're likely to come across in many schools and it's becoming more and more popular in schools in England. As Professor Robert Coe reminds us, retrieval practice is strongly supported by over a hundred years of research and is one of only two learning techniques rated by Dunlosky as having high utility for classroom practice. There's a huge amount of research to support its use and yet like many things that seem so simple in teaching it has to be done really well or it could throw up a few calamitous pitfalls.

So why is retrieving prior knowledge a useful thing to do?

It enables the children to see their learning going somewhere that lessons aren't just weird little modularised bite-size chunks of learning but part of a golden thread of knowledge and Barak Rosenshine suggests that teachers begin their lesson with review of prior learning for two reasons:

<ol>
  <li>
    It's a practice recalling previously learnt material, thereby strengthening
    the ability to recall it in the future.
  </li>
  <li>To link new material to that which has come before.</li>
</ol>
So retrieval practice can be an exceptionally useful thing to do at the start of
a lesson. It's not simply recap, in other words, going back over something but it's
about the children actively trying to recall knowledge from their long-term memory.

It also helps their children to develop schemas that we can signpost. In their book ‘What every teacher needs to know about psychology’, David Didau and Nick Rose say that a schema has to be thought of as an organizing framework representing some aspect of the world and a system of organising that information.

Let's think about that in practice for a minute. Imagine I have taught Stevenson's ‘The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ to my Year 11 group. Weve’ probably spent lots of time exploring the nature of mankind, secrets, duality, all sorts of interesting things. So when we move on to power and conflict poetry and I teach them Shelley's poem ‘Ozymandias’ and they come across the noun ‘visage’, the children will have a schema of connections about concealment upon which to draw to help them unpick the noun ‘visage’. If we can help our pupils make explicit links between these different lessons, the better they are able to develop secure schemas. And retrieval practice can really help with this.

So how can you incorporate retrieval practices in your lessons? You can start your lesson with a low stakes quiz. They're effective, efficient and predictable. Pupils know what's coming and so it can free up working memory. Your lesson becomes a tool and an effective routine. There are of course other ways to take advantage of retrieval practice and although Rosenshine talks about using the start of the lesson to review previously learnt material, don't think that this is the only opportunity to make those things sometimes there will be opportunities and lessons to naturally recap on knowledge learnt in a different unit or lesson. At other times you'll want to plan in opportunities. Both are fine and really useful.

Claire highlights two key functions of review when used to build and strengthen learning:

- To consolidate material by prompting pupils to recall what they have learnt
- To help pupils make links between new knowledge and prior knowledge and connect this in their mental model

  <li>
    <strong>How did you incorporate it into your practice?</strong>

## Mentor meeting

In the previous term, you learnt about how effective explanations can prevent working memory overload. Explanations are a vital part of effective teaching and therefore will be recapped in your next mentor meeting. You mentor will observe your explanations and may focus on how you:

- break complex material and explanation into small steps.
- combine a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation
- use worked or partially completed examples.

### How pupils learn

2.7 Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.

2.8 Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall.

This session will take **approximately 65 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Explanations and modelling are an important scaffold that build pupil learning and therefore, it is important you do this effectively.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Gradually building knowledge

- Explanations and modelling – why are they so important?

  - Using think aloud
  - Modelling cognition and metacognition

## Gradually build knowledge

When you first introduce new material, pupils need a large amount of support and guidance to understand the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the material you are teaching them. As they become more proficient, the support can be slowly reduced whilst their independence during practice is increased, until they eventually are able to work independently.

During teaching and learning, the general process for this is to begin with teacher input, followed by guided practice, followed by independent practice. Some people refer to the process of gradually building pupil independence and ownership over their learning as ‘I do (teacher input), we do (guided practice), you do (independent practice)’. This process may happen within one lesson or over a sequence of lessons to gradually build pupil knowledge and help them reach their lesson objective or learning goal. This session will focus on the process within a lesson, but you will explore how this is built in over a sequence of lessons in module 6.

### Start with the lesson objective

When planning your instruction, it is important that you begin by establishing what the lesson objective is. Once you know this, you can identify what the pupils will need to know, or be able to do, in order to achieve the lesson objective. This information should inform the focus of your teaching instruction. The explanations and modelling, guided practice and independent practice that you plan should gradually build pupils’ knowledge, working towards the lesson objective.

### Gradually increase pupil independence

The process of gradually increasing pupil independence throughout a lesson can be broken down as follows:

#### Teacher input

This occurs when new material is first being introduced. It involves the teacher informing, explaining, modelling and providing examples without pupil input. This is where you might use worked examples to outline the steps of a procedure to pupils.

The reason this is teacher led without pupil input is because when new material is being introduced, pupils are novices and therefore, are unlikely to have the appropriate knowledge to contribute to the process at this stage.

#### Guided practice

This involves the teacher and pupils doing a task together. This is where you begin to gradually release the responsibility to your pupils. It involves you completing parts of the process and asking pupils to contribute to the incomplete parts. Here you might use partially completed examples to gradually build pupil independence.

#### Independent practice

This is the stage where pupils practise new material without adult support. When first setting up independent practice, you may still provide tasks that scaffold pupils’ learning but over time these should be removed to allow pupils to work entirely independently. Rosenshine (2012) recognises that this is vital for pupils to become fluent or automatic in information retrieval or completing a procedure. During this stage, the teacher monitors pupil practice to identify and address misconceptions to individual pupils or the whole class. They also encourage pupils to use metacognitive strategies to monitor their own learning and develop their ability to self-regulate.

$I

<h3>Key messages about this process</h3>
Whilst these stages have been separated into three groups, the process of building
pupil independence should be viewed as a continuum whereby support gradually reduces
as pupils become more proficient.

This will not occur in a linear fashion. In practice, you may have to shift back and forth between these three phases during a lesson to address misunderstandings or introduce further challenge.

Throughout this module, building pupils’ expertise over a lesson has been broken down into different phases which are covered in different sessions. However, it is important that you remember the phases are linked and should build on one another.
$I

## Explanations and modelling – why are they so important?

High quality instruction enables the expert teacher to impart knowledge to the novice learner. When teaching new material, this can be done through effective explanations and modelling.

### Explanations and modelling – what’s the difference?

Explanations are used to introduce new material to pupils in small sequential steps, which you will have already explored in module two. During an explanation, the teacher will talk through the new material and ask pupils lots of questions to check their understanding.

Modelling accompanies an explanation to show pupils how to approach or complete a task. Modelling is vital during teacher explanations because it shows pupils how to do something well. Making this explicit through modelling, supports pupils understanding and builds their mental model of what ‘good’ looks like.

In this part of the module we'll be exploring how Rosenshine reminds us to present new material using small steps. And as part of this we’ll cover the importance of explanation and how Rosenshine also reminds us about the importance of providing models. Andy Tharby reminds us that from about the age of two children develop the intellectual ability to ask ‘why’ questions. I'm sure that this is something that those of you working in Early Years Foundation Stage can relate to. As Tharby says, children, especially very young children go on a tireless hunt for further information and elaboration that might lift the veil on the wonders of the universe. How wonderful and what a weighty responsibility we have to get our explanations right. So, what's the purpose of an explanation? Tharby reminds us that explanation can have a range of purposes:

<ol>
  <li>To make something understandable</li>
  <li>To clarify and expand an idea</li>
  <li>To give causes context and consequences of a situation or event</li>
  <li>Or show how facts and concepts are related and connected</li>
</ol>
So effective explanations are hugely important. Tharby makes it crystal clear when
he says, ‘It is near impossible to conceive of effective teaching without explanation’.
Teacher talk is vital. If the children can't access our expertise through clear,
precise, knowledgeable explanations they are disadvantaged. And the evidence from
cognitive science shows that the less prior knowledge of pupil has, the more teacher
guidance they need. So, explanations are vital for the children we teach to make
sense of the world around them. It's hard, and again it takes lots of practice for
a novice teacher. But explanations illuminate.

In this session, you'll learn to start making links between what you know about working memory and effective explanations. Effective explanations are chunked. The teacher does not overwhelm pupils by presenting too much information at once as the working memory can become overloaded. Information and new material are presented in small steps and often with many concrete examples. This is where modelling can come in. The importance of concrete examples so the children can see what a good or indeed a bad example looks like. As Tom Sherrington says, ‘providing models is a central feature of giving good explanations’. Models can be used in any phase of schooling and are an important element of the children having a concrete example of what it looks like. Weinstein and Sumeracki remind us that novices find abstract ideas vague and hard to grasp so concrete examples are much easier to remember. Models help to illustrate abstract ideas and make them easier to understand. Models can organize the information for the novice into a well-structured schema.

## Explanations

As Claire Stoneman highlights, Rosenshine (2012) explains that in order to address the limitations of the working memory, teachers should introduce material in small steps. This is something you previously explored in module two. But, as Claire states, some material being taught can be hard to comprehend even when it is broken down and taught in small steps. This normally occurs when the material you are teaching is abstract.

To support pupil understanding when teaching an abstract concept, you should provide pupils with concrete examples and non-examples to demonstrate the concept.

This is something that will be explored further in your next training session but in order to prepare yourself, watch the following videos. You can choose to do this now or return to this ahead of your training session.

$Summary

$EndSummary

I use concrete examples to model abstract ideas by showing a real-world example that demonstrates the abstract concept. Abstract ideas can be vague and hard to grasp - solidifying an explanation using real life examples makes it easier for pupils to understand and remember.

For example, when teaching the coastal processes of erosion and deposition, I explain these abstract terms to pupils by teaching their definitions and exploring how they are different to each other.

I then developed pupils’ understanding of these abstract terms and unfamiliar vocabulary within their definitions using concrete examples, which in this case was coastal landforms. In geography, using a photograph of a coastal landform such as a wave cut notch (show image) or a spit (show image) to demonstrate what is involved in the process of erosion and deposition strengthens pupils’ understanding as it gives them a chance to apply their new knowledge of the process to a real-life example. In geography his is often thorough a case study or photograph.

When using concrete examples, I ensure I present pupils with a wide variety to prevent them from developing a narrow understanding of the term in which misconceptions can easily arise. For example, if I only showed pupils one coastal landform where erosion had taken place, they may incorrectly think that erosion was defined only by that one coastal landform when in fact erosion can be generalised to many other landforms.

After I explained the concept using concrete examples, I checked pupils’ understanding by presenting them with another landform and asking them whether it was created by erosion or deposition. I knew pupils understood the abstract concepts ‘erosion’ and ‘deposition’ when they were able to correctly identify it in unfamiliar examples.

Using a non-example by Ashley Philipson
$EndHeading
$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
Non-examples are the opposite of <em>examples</em>. We use examples in our teaching to show a real-world example of an abstract concept we are teaching – this is a fundamental tool in many subjects. Where <em>examples</em> provide an instance of similarity, non-examples provide an instance of contrast.

Non-examples are important in teaching as they are another tool which can be used to allow pupils to develop their understanding. Being able to explain why something is not a correct example is as important as knowing the correct examples.

When I teach how coastal landforms have been created, I teach pupils about coastal landforms that have been formed through the process of erosion, <em>and</em> coastal landforms which have been formed the process of deposition. When pupils explain how features of coastal landforms have been made, a good answer will refer to the <em>process</em> involved, rather than just a <em>sequence</em> of what happens.

To help pupils identify the difference between the two processes, I use a non-example.

I might do this by saying:

“a spit is a non-example of an erosional coastal feature”

And then I might explain why to pupils or, ask them to explain why to me.

This is a good non-example as some of its features are correct:

<ul>
  <li>
    it is a coastal feature <em>and</em>
  </li>
  <li>initially erosion has contributed to it</li>
</ul>
However, it has one difference:
<ul>
  <li>its final formation is created through deposition.</li>
</ul>
If pupils can understand and explain this, it shows they have a much deeper understanding
of the concepts of erosion and deposition. Rather than learning something just because
we have told them it is true; they begin to understand why and how, and then key
concepts begin to make sense.

In this case pupils will have a deeper understanding of more than just that one example – they understand what erosion and deposition is and the resultant features and can therefore begin to apply this knowledge when explaining the formation of landforms in new contexts.

As Ashley states, non-examples are a great way to show what something isn’t; therefore, they are an effective way of exposing potential pitfalls and explaining how to avoid them. Listen to Elizabeth Arkle talk about when she has used a non-example to develop pupils’ reasoning skills by encouraging them to identify and explain common misconceptions.

One point at which I have used non-examples is towards the end of a sequence of teaching to support self-explanation in order to check and deepen understanding. Take for example, a year 4 maths objective ‘to add and subtract up to 4 digit numbers’. Once we have worked through the small steps, and all children are able to add numbers using the column method, I have used non-examples to explore common misconceptions. Children often seem to love nothing more than finding your mistakes! Non-examples have worked well here in getting children to watch what happens, think about the mistakes, explain what I have done wrong, but then go on to explain what I should have done.

When teaching, I will put the example on the board first in linear format for example:   3456 – 798 =

this allows me to go on and set it out with place value errors which are a common mistake.

I will then go on, without narration, to work through the question. It is important to note that at this point the children should be secure in the skill, this is the end of the teaching sequence and is giving them a chance to explore common misconception.

The class know they have to let me finish, they are not allowed to jump in and shout out any mistakes I make. Only once I have finished can children reflect on what I have done and offer an opinion.

Children will then work in their books first, putting my calculation in their books and reflecting on it. They then annotate my calculation to explain the mistakes, then complete their own calculation alongside it to correct my errors. To develop reasoning, they then come up and explain why I am right or wrong then, if they think I am wrong, they will need to correct the example, narrating what I have done wrong. If they think I am right, then they have to work through my example to explain what I did and why it is right.

Children know they are not allowed to interrupt each other but they can offer an opinion at the end.

Pupils have become more articulate in explaining their methods and they are much more aware of the mistakes. They can make, and are more aware, avoiding careless mistakes.

As a teacher, I have become much more aware of reserving time for children to think things through, then the time and space to talk through what is right or wrong. Using non-examples in this way has deepened the understanding of all pupils in my class. The fact that they are looking for my mistakes really grabs their attention as well so they all tend to be really engaged and think deeply about the question so they can tell me if and where I have gone wrong.

## Modelling

Modelling is an essential part of the teaching and learning process. Rosenshine (2012) found that the most effective teachers guided pupils’ practice for longer during teaching instruction, using modelling and scaffolds. This ensured pupils were confident and able to work independently later in their learning. Whereas teachers who gave less guidance to pupils during their explanations, spent more time correcting individual errors because not enough time was spent ensuring pupils had a good understanding before being asked to work independently.

There are different ways you can model to support pupil understanding, but this session will focus on ‘Think Aloud’.

## Using ‘Think Aloud’

‘Think Aloud’ is a form of live modelling which makes the implicit process of completing a task, explicit. It is when a teacher narrates their thoughts, questions or corrections as they complete an activity, so that the pupils have a clear example of how to think and what to consider when approaching a certain task. This type of modelling helps to make abstract ideas or processes concrete and accessible. It is also a good strategy to use to expose potential pitfalls to pupils and explain how to avoid them.

This process is used to demonstrate an expert’s (the teacher’s) cognition and metacognition. Using what you learnt in module two, can you answer the questions in this quick quiz?

## Modelling cognition and metacognition using ‘Think Aloud’

### Modelling cognition

In simple terms, cognition is the thinking you do when completing a task. Teachers can model their thinking about their knowledge to demonstrate how to draw on cognitive strategies when completing a task.

$I
Below is an example of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model their cognitive process by engaging their prior knowledge when performing a forward roll safely in PE. This has been taken from the <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacognition and Self-regulated Learning Guidance Report</a> (EEF, 2017):

Preparing for the roll: <em>“I don’t want to hurt my neck and want to do this neatly. So first, to protect my neck, I need to tuck my chin to my chest like this.”</em>

Starting the roll: <em>“Then when I start to roll, I remember not to roll onto my head. Instead, look how I’m going to roll onto my back and shoulders.”</em>

Completing the roll: <em>“This also means my back is round, so I can smoothly roll like this.”</em>

Checking pupils’ understanding: <em>“Now, who can remember what I did first to protect my neck?”</em>

In this example, the teacher has broken down completing a forward roll into constituent components (outlined above) and is narrating the important points pupils need to consider at each stage. Without this narration, the pupils might not know how to break the task down or how to replicate the roll safely and successfully.
$I

### Modelling metacognition:

Metacognition can be broken down into three different stages:

- **planning** which cognitive strategies to use
- **monitoring** how successful the strategy is and changing it if necessary
- **evaluating** your overall approach to improve it next time.

$I
Below is an example of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model their metacognitive processes when planning how to answer a History question:

‘The main reason why the League of Nations could not stop aggression in the 1930s was because the USA was not a member. Do you agree?’
$I

### Planning:

“How am I going to approach answering this? Well firstly, I must ensure I understand the question. To do that, I am first going to read it. (teacher models reading it). Then I am going to underline key words that help me understand how I should answer the question. I can see at the end, it asks, ‘Do you agree?’, so what does that mean? It means I am going to have to give an opinion.”

“What information am I going to have to include? Well, it mentions the USA not being a member as one reason for aggression, so I know I am going to have to talk about that. Would that be a good essay if I only wrote about one point? What do I know about other essays I have read or written? What makes them effective at demonstrating my opinion? Normally I have to discuss three points. I know I will talk about the USA not being a member as one point because it is cited in the question. Do I think that’s the most important point? Or do I think there are other points? What information can help me? Well, if I think back to our other lessons on this, I can recall some other points that we have covered.” Teacher asks pupils, “Which other points have we covered? Talk to your partner,” and then discusses their ideas.

“So, I now have three points, I need to consider what information do I know about these. What can I do now to plan and ensure I have enough to write about? Perhaps I will write down some bullet points under each idea to prompt me to include key points in each paragraph.” (Teacher models writing down bullet points of information to include).

“Now I need to consider how to structure them. Which order should I put them in? Well I know that to make my opinion clear, it would be helpful to put the strongest point at the beginning.”

In this example, the teacher has broken down planning how to approach answering an essay question into constituent components and is narrating their metacognitive thoughts to make these explicit to pupils.

Later in this process, the teacher might model thought processes which demonstrate them monitoring how effective their strategy is and evaluating their strategy such as:

### Monitoring:

Has my plan enabled me to answer the question effectively?

Is my opinion clear enough?

Have I ensured I have included enough detail in each paragraph to clearly explain my point?

Am I rereading what I have written to ensure the information makes sense and links back to the question?

### Evaluating:

Did my plan provide me with enough detail to include in my essay?

How could I enhance my planning to ensure I include more detail next time?

Would using my notes from previous lessons help me in the planning stage?

How successful was I at staying focused on answering the question when writing my essay? What could I do next time to support me with this?

## Making ‘Think Aloud’ successful

### Starting narration at the point of pupil understanding

When talking through your thinking, it is important that you consider what the pupils’ prior knowledge is. For example, if pupils have never seen a forward roll before, the teacher would need to demonstrate this first so pupils could attach the teacher’s narrated cognition to something concrete. If they don’t know what a forward roll is, the rest of the narration is less meaningful.

### Focus the narration around key teaching points

What you say is very important and should be carefully planned out. The narration should be focused around the objectives or key teaching points that you want pupils to focus on. If you narrate everything you are thinking, this could cognitively overload pupils, preventing them from following the key features you want them to learn or consider themselves.

## Why is this such an important way of modelling?

The EEF (2017) highlights that modelling of this type is often not planned into explanations because the thinking processes occur ‘naturally’ to the expert (teacher), which is a **risk** because such thought processes are vital for breaking down a task so that it can be better understood or completed successfully.

To move from novice to expert, pupils need to know how an expert habitually thinks and acts (EEF, 2017). By modelling these thought processes, you make the implicit or hidden parts of a process explicit and exposed, helping to build the novices mental model of what they should be doing in similar situations.

## Which narration is most effective?

To do ensure ‘Think Aloud’ is successful, you should:

- Ensure narration is linked to key teaching points
- Ensure narration considers pupils prior knowledge

Look at the following scripts of a teacher using ‘Think Aloud’ to model using adjectives in a sentence. Identify which one is more effective and why.

<h4>Example 1:</h4>
“I want to describe what the emperor penguin looks like. How will I start my sentence?
Hmm, I’ll start with ‘The’ – as it’s the beginning of a sentence I must use a capital
letter” (<em>teacher scribes as they speak</em>) “emperor penguin – now I am going
to describe its colour – has black feathers down his back. Hold on, I can make that
better by using two adjectives to describe the feathers – has glossy, black feathers
down his back – I must remember to separate two adjectives in a list with a comma,”
(<em>teacher inserts comma</em>). “Now I might extend the sentence using the conjunction
‘and’ – and snowy, white feathers covering its front. Let’s check, have I used two
adjectives together to improve my description?” (<em>
  Teacher models re-reading sentence to check it makes sense and to check for
  the use of adjectives
</em>).
<h4>Example 2:</h4>
“I want to describe what the emperor penguin looks like. How will I start my sentence?
Hmm, I’ll start with ‘The’” (<em>teacher scribes as they speak</em>) – “The emperor
penguin has black feathers down his back. Hold on, I can make that better – has glossy,
black feathers down his back – I must remember to use a comma,” (<em>

</em>). “Now I might extend the sentence - and snowy, white feathers covering its
front. Let’s check, my work.” (<em>

So, class, I've looked over your work and the first paragraph of your stories and I'm so impressed you've all worked so hard to try and paint a picture in my mind of London at that time. Lots of you have given me great factual details about London but remember, our objective was looking at writing detailed descriptions and through our word choices create feelings of emotion in our readers. So today I want you to have a look back at your writing from yesterday and try and consider how you would bring your descriptions to life for your reader through the word choices you make.

Let's have a look at a few examples of how you could do that. So I've taken these sentences from the model I shared with you the other day:

<em>
  ‘Matthew looked up at the sky and he saw the planes in the distance. He heard
  the siren sound so he ran as fast as he could.’
</em>

Now I, as an author, am going to reread what I've written and consider if I could change any parts of these sentences so that I give the reader a more detailed description and try and get them to understand how the character is feeling at this moment.

So as I read what I'd written the first thing I noticed was the noun ‘sky’. ‘<em>Matthew looked up at the sky.</em>’ From what I've written I can't really identify whether it's day or night. And as we know the sky can look really different at different times of the day or with different weather so I'm going to add an adjective to help the reader to be able to picture the sky with more detail.

As lots of these raids happened at night I think I'm going to emphasize to the reader that it's night. So I've had to think of some words that I might use to describe the sky at night and you should do this too when you're thinking about different words that you could use. So I like ‘smokey’ because I think there might be still some fires around London throwing smoke into the air but then if it was smokey William wouldn't be able to see the plane, would he? So I might not use that one.

I think ‘dark’ could be a good descriptive word maybe I'll use that one it sounds a bit scary as well doesn't it was dark and ominous. I thought pitch black would be a good word but now I look at it again, if something's pitch black you can't see anything at all so William wouldn't be able to see the plane coming, would he?

I like ‘charcoal’ because charcoal is black and it would indicate that it was night but also you get charcoal from a fire and I like that it kind of reflects that London has been on fire and maybe there's still the smell of charcoal in the air. I also like clear so we can see the plane but that wouldn't help the reader understand whether it was night or day so if I use the word clear I'd have to pair it with one of the other words.

So after thinking through those words I've decided to go with charcoal because I think it describes to the reader that it is nighttime but also that it's a dark night, darker than usual as there's been fires across London that have made the air all and the sky all dirty with soot and smoke.

So my sentence now reads:

<em>
  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the planes in the distance.’
</em>

And the next word that catches my eye is planes. I've just put down’ and he saw the planes’. I don't really give any more detail than this to my reader and as an author I want to make sure that my language is emotive and makes the reader feel something, don't I? I want them to feel frightened of the thought of this plane coming. So the words I’ve thought of I could describe the plane are ‘enemy’, ‘intimidating’, ‘fearsome’ and ‘formidable’. All words are indications of something powerful and dangerous coming William's way. So this time I've selected two words as I felt that I really wanted to make it clear that the planes that William was seeing weren't allied planes. They were planes of the enemy but I also wanted to show how William was feeling about seeing them that he thinks they're fearsome something that sparks the feeling of fear in him.

So the sentence now reads:

<em>
  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the fearsome enemy planes in
  the distance.’{" "}
</em>

You can hear the tone of the sentence has changed just adding those few words and now I've decided that I want to increase this feeling of fear in these sentences and I think I want to add a prepositional phrase here to make everything feel even more urgent and that everything's happening really fast.

So I've thought of the following three prepositions of time: ‘suddenly’, ‘in an instant’, ‘within moments’. Each of these indicates that something has happened quickly and will help build the tension of these sentences and that these planes will be near William imminently. I've gone with ‘within moments’ and any of these could have worked but I think that ‘suddenly’ is used quite often and I wanted something a little bit different so I’ve gone with within moments.

The final description that I think I'll change is the is the phrase the siren sound. I liked this initially as I added some alliteration which with an ‘s’ sound is called the ‘sibilant’ and it makes a hissing sound the siren sound which when I first wrote this I thought the siren could hiss but I want to increase attention more for the reader by using my description so I think I will change this word to a sound that sounds more like a person who is scared. So the words I've thought of are ‘cry’, ‘wail’, ‘scream’ and ‘bellow’ which means shout loudly and all of these are sort of things that somebody would do if they were scared. And I've decided to go with ‘wail’ within moments he heard the siren ‘wail’ so he ran as fast as he could and because a siren can't actually wail like a person. I've actually personified the siren I've given it a human characteristic which is one of the things, the writing techniques, that we looked at the other week that helped the author describe to the reader how something might sound or might look.

So with just a few minutes of deep thinking about how I could make these two sentences more descriptive for the reader and only changing a few words I’ve now given my reader a more detailed description of the events and one that will get across more the danger of the situation and the fear of the character. So it previously read:

<em>
  ‘Matthew looked up at the sky and he saw the planes in the distance he heard
  the siren sound so he ran as fast as he could.’
</em>

Which actually could be read quite positively he could be excited to see the planes and he could be running to greet whoever is whoever's coming off them. But the sentence written now has much more impact and is actually how i want the reader to feel when they read my writing and it reads:

<em>
  ‘Matthew looked up at the charcoal sky and he saw the fearsome enemy planes in
  the distance. Within moments he heard the siren wail so he ran as fast as he
  could.’
</em>

And that's what we're aiming for with our writing. To have an impact on people in some way and with these sentences I wanted to make them feel fear and tension

## Summary

Explanations and modelling are vital for building a strong foundational understanding of key knowledge or procedures in pupils. However, merely showing pupils new information or processes is not enough. Pupils need to be given the opportunity to practise new material in order to store it in their long-term memory (Rosenshine, 2012). When introducing material in small steps, pupils need to practise after each step. Providing opportunities for practise is something that will be explored in the next session.

## Application of modelling

$CTA
In your next meeting, your mentor will observe you using ‘Think Aloud’ to make your implicit thought processes explicit.

Think ahead to the lesson that will be observed and spend the next 15 minutes scripting what you will say whilst using ‘Think Aloud’ to model. Remember, to ensure ‘Think Aloud’ is successful you should ensure narration:

<ul>
  <li>is linked to key teaching points</li>
  <li>considers pupils prior knowledge</li>
  <li>models using key terminology</li>
</ul>

4.2 Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned.

4.3 Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.

4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.

4.5 Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.

## Session overview

Guided practice is an essential component of effective teaching as it gradually builds pupils’ independence.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Why is practice important?
- Obtain a high success rate
- Guided practice
- Supporting writing through guided practice

## Why is practice important?

As Rosenshine (2012) highlights, research into information processing shows that merely showing pupils new information or processes is not enough. Pupils need to be given the opportunity to practise new material in order to store it in their long-term memory. Rehearsal helps pupils to retrieve information easily. If pupils have had insufficient rehearsal opportunities, they are more likely to find it difficult to retrieve and use this information. This means their working memory will be consumed with recalling information, limiting the pupil’s ability to learn new information or problem solve. This can have a negative impact on both learning and motivation as it reduces pupils’ chances of achieving meaningful success.

Therefore, it is important you provide multiple opportunities for pupils to practise throughout a lesson.

This is the element of the lesson or sequence of lessons where the pupils are applying their knowledge and practicing. Practicing is a crucial part of learning and at any phase of schooling we need to build in opportunities for practice. Mark Enser invites us to consider the difference between practice and performance and says that in the classroom we need to consider what our pupils’ final performance will involve and then add in small steps of practice that will build towards the successful outcome.

The successful outcome might be a piece of music performed on a recorder. A pupil using mathematical language to describe the characteristics of everyday objects. An essay about the Norman Conquest. But it's important that practice is built-in to ensure the outcome is successful.

When you build in opportunities for practice think about chunking the practice in small steps so as not to overload the working memory. Sherrington reminds us that while the children are practicing you will want to ensure that practice must be guided so that the chance of forming misconceptions is minimized. Sherrington also explains the importance of obtaining a high success rates while practicing. He says <em>‘guidance is key to generating the high success rates that in turn fuels motivation and engagement during more independent work’</em>. So while the pupils are practicing, scaffolds and models and worked examples are all really useful in fuelling motivation as well to contribute to high success rate. There will be a point we will begin to withdraw the scaffolds to ensure that pupils begin to use the knowledge and skills stored and built up in their long-term memory over time.

So they'll be moving from clunky and manual to smooth and automatic. But all this is also dependent on the subject, the topic you're teaching and the elements of the topic you're teaching. There's no one-size-fits-all solution to this. You will have to think carefully through the best way for the children to practice within the subject or topic in order for them to become fluent.

As Claire highlights, practice is integral to effective teaching. Through practice, pupils consolidate their understanding of knowledge or their ability to complete a process by rephrasing, elaborating upon or summarising information (Rosenshine, 2012). Practice also gives pupils a chance to demonstrate their level of understanding, which can highlight misunderstandings. Therefore, practice has two main purposes:

- It provides pupils with opportunity to consolidate their understanding before moving onto the next step in their learning.
- It provides a chance for you to pick up on misconceptions that begin to arise.

Consequently, pupils should have repeated opportunities to practise with appropriate guidance and support. Like the other features of effective teaching, such as explanations, modelling, and questioning, practice should be intertwined throughout the lesson and sequence of lessons. Practise should follow a teacher input where the new material has been sufficiently explained and modelled. Initial practice should be guided, and, as pupils become more proficient, pupils should transition to independent practice. Throughout any practice, it is important that pupils obtain a high success rate.

## Obtain a high success rate

Before you delve into the details of guided and independent practice, it is important to consider why you should ensure pupils are successful during practice.

As Claire Stoneman mentions, one of Rosenshine’s (2012) principles is to ensure pupils obtain a high success rate during practice. This means that, during practice, it is important that pupils are getting most of their answers correct. This is pertinent in both guided and independent work for two reasons:

1. Motivation - the experience of being successful at something can boost motivation
2. Learning errors – if pupils make too many mistakes, they are practising making those errors and are more likely to embed misconceptions

The research that Rosenshine refers to, found the optimal success rate during the early stages of practice was around 80%. This ensures pupils are getting many answers right whilst still being challenged, demonstrating they have learning goals ahead of their current ability. Achieving 80% success rate for every pupil in every lesson would be challenging so this can be used as a rough guide.

When pupils are completing independent practice, success rates need to be as high as possible to avoid pupils learning errors. This is especially important if you are using homework as a form of independent practice as pupils are not likely to receive feedback whilst completing their work, making it more likely they will incorrectly learn material if they have misconceptions.

### Continually evaluating pupil success

You must continually evaluate the success of your pupils so you can adapt your teaching and the level of challenge accordingly. This can be done in many ways, for example, through questioning or through circulating the classroom whilst pupils are working.

_If pupil success is much lower than 80%…_

Then you may need to go back and re-teach or re-explain the concept, followed by more guided practice before moving pupils onto independent practice.

_If pupil success is much higher than 80%…_

Then you may need to give them more of a challenge by deepening their knowledge further. You may begin by gradually reducing the level of scaffold by increasing the levels of depth of knowledge required for the task. One way to do this is through the questioning, which will be explored in the final session of this module.

$CTA

<h3 style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Reflection</h3>
Think about a time you had a low success rate from one or many pupils either during
guided or independent practice and answer the following questions in your notepad.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What do you think caused the low success rate?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      When you noticed many pupils were making mistakes, what did you do?
    </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

## Guided practice

When teaching new material to pupils, their initial practise should be guided to ensure pupils obtain a high success rate.

Rosenshine (2012) found that more successful teachers spent longer guiding pupils’ practise through explanations and modelling than less effective teachers. In this time, they asked many questions to allow pupils to retrieve and rehearse material and check pupils’ understanding before moving onto subsequent steps. Less effective teachers spent less time on guided practice and asked pupils to move onto independent work sooner. During the independent work, the pupils who received more guided practice before completing the independent tasks, were better prepared and achieved higher success in their work than those who received less guided practice. Insufficient early practice or guidance often leads to more problems arising during independent work and can have a negative impact on pupil motivation.

Therefore, it is vital that you plan to include enough guided practice before moving onto independent work. A common mistake is to provide a short episode of guided practice and assume pupils are ready to begin independent practice when they aren’t. To help prevent this, you should constantly check for understanding so you can provide corrective or affirmative feedback or re-teach material where gaps remain to ensure pupils are fully prepared for independent practice. Checking for understanding will be explored in the last session of this module.

## Forms of guided practice

After pupils have been exposed to high-quality explanations and models, they can begin to be involved in the knowledge recall or procedural process. This is where pupils begin to take ownership over parts of the task with the support of the teacher as a scaffold or guide.

In Maths, this might be a teacher working out an equation and asking for pupils to suggest the next step or possible answers. In Science, this might be a teacher composing a conclusion and asking pupils to share the correct terminology or next idea of what to write. In Art, it might be a teacher painting a picture and asking pupils which colours to use and why. In Early Years, it might be a teacher modelling the formation of a letter and asking the pupils to join in by drawing it in the air. In P.E this might be a teacher modelling, with narration, how to attack in a three vs two and asking for pupil suggestions of what to do next and why.

During this time, it is important that you give feedback on pupils’ answers or ideas and address any misconceptions that arise.

## Supporting writing through guided practice

In their guidance report, the EEF (2019) emphasise the importance for literacy skills to be taught in all subjects and disciplines where possible as research has found that there are links between pupils’ literacy skills and their performance in GCSEs across many subjects, not just English.

Reading, writing, and comprehension feature in all subjects in some way. Therefore, it is essential that all teachers strive to support and develop pupils’ literacy skills where possible and one way to do this is through guiding pupils during the writing, also known as Shared Writing.

## Shared writing

This can be used on any occasion where pupils are being asked to compose a written response, which will occur in almost every subject. Supporting pupils with their writing across the curriculum provides them with more opportunities to practice and receive feedback which will support writing development.

Shared writing is a form of guided practice where a teacher writes with and in front of pupils to develop their ability to write independently (Corbett, 2015). When doing this, teachers can use a variety of modelling strategies, including ‘Think Aloud’ to make the implicit thought process of an expert writer explicit to novice learners.

$I
Some general principles of shared writing are:

<ul>
  <li>Generate writing based on pupils’ ideas they share.</li>
  <li>
    Remind, prompt and challenge pupils so the writing remains focused on the
    skills and vocabulary being developed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Model good writing skills such as rereading the text and listening to the
    flow of composition so the next sentence can be composed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep the pace brisk to ensure pupils don’t lose focus but include pauses for
    ‘thinking time’.
  </li>
</ul>
$I

Shared writing is the guided phase used to develop pupil independence in writing. It engages the whole class during teaching instruction but can also be used as a support to groups of pupils during writing tasks.

In a sequence, it would come after teacher input, where a teacher models writing without pupil input using ‘Think Aloud’, but before independent practice, where pupils are asked to work without adult support.

## Summary

Guided practice is essential as it provides opportunities for pupils to consolidate their learning, helping them to retrieve material from their long-term memory, whilst simultaneously providing an insight into their level of understanding and highlighting any misconceptions they may have.

Before pupils move onto guided practice, they need an appropriate level of knowledge which should be developed during explanations and modelling, prior to guided practice.

During guided practice, it is likely you will still include elements of modelling and explanation to clarify understanding and build upon pupils’ learning. Therefore, explanations and modelling cannot be separated from guided practice as they are heavily intertwined.

Pupils level of understanding during guided practice should be continually reviewed through questioning (explored in the last session of this module). This will inform you of how to progress the lesson. If pupils demonstrate a low success rate during guided practice, then you may need to return to the explanations and models you exposed them to when first introducing the material and provide more examples to build up their understanding and address gaps in learning.

Equally, if pupils are very confident during guided practice, you may need to reduce the level of support or guidance you are providing.

## Application to practice

Identify a lesson you will soon teach in the next week and plan to include guided practice. When doing so, consider the following points:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      What will pupils need to know prior to guided practice? This will inform
      what to include in your explanations and modelling
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      What key teaching points will the guided practice focus on? These will be
      the parts they are asked to contribute to.
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      What methods or strategies will you utilise? E.g. thinking aloud,
      partially completed examples

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How does guided practice build on from your explanation and modelling?

This session will take **approximately 60 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Independent practice is a vital part of effective teaching as this is where pupils can consolidate their learning. There are many things to consider when planning effective independent practice.

To support you to do this, this session will explore:

- Why is independent practice important?
- Planning the right practice activity
- Providing further guides and scaffolds
- Using collaborative practice to best effect
- Gradually removing scaffolding

## Why is independent practice important?

Independent practice can arbitrarily be viewed as the third phase of learning. It is where pupils practise new material without the support from adults, and eventually, resources. Rosenshine (2012) recognises independent practice as a vital part of learning because it provides pupils with the much-required opportunity to complete a procedure or activity over and over. He identifies ‘overlearning’ as necessary for pupils to become fluent or automatic in a skill. When pupils become automatic in a process or skill, they free up their working memory which can be used to apply their learning to new contexts.

The more pupils practise the material, the stronger the retrieval strength becomes. Without enough independent practice, pupils will find it more challenging to recall information or procedures at a later stage as the retrieval strength of the new material won’t be as strong.

## Planning the right practice activity

During independent practice, pupils should work on the same material covered during guided practice to give them an opportunity to consolidate their learning.

For example, if you covered finding the area of rectangular shapes during guided practice, then that’s what pupils should focus on during independent practice. It would be inappropriate to ask them to find the area of compound shapes as the strategy for doing so is different. Pupils would need to see this being modelled and engage in guided practice before working on this independently, otherwise you are likely to obtain a low success rate from many pupils and need to reteach the material. Therefore, it is vital you carefully plan both the guided and independent practice, so they focus on practising the same material.

Independent practice should be planned to ensure pupils think hard about the material they have covered during guided practice. This seems straight forward and obvious but can be more challenging than it might appear.

Sometimes, you may think you are planning activities that provide opportunities for pupils to practice or demonstrate the knowledge that you have been developing, but this may not always be the case. In order to complete an activity successfully, pupils need to have all the knowledge required. However, certain aspects can be overlooked when planning independent practice for pupils.

An example of this could be pupils writing a newspaper article to demonstrate or practice their knowledge of a topic (Enser, 2019). Unless they have been taught how to write a newspaper article; how to generate a catchy title, how to write in columns, or how to use direct and indirect quotes, then they won’t get the opportunity to practise what you intended. Because of the limitations on working memory, they will be consumed with the features of a newspaper article, instead of demonstrating or practising their knowledge of a topic. If, however, the pupils have already mastered the writing components of a newspaper article, then this could be a suitable way for them to present the material they are learning about. It is important that pupils have the relevant domain-specific knowledge before being asked to apply their knowledge or think critically.

Therefore, it is important you spend time carefully planning activities that provide pupils with the opportunity to practise or demonstrate their learning, taking into consideration any additional foundational knowledge they may require.

## Which activity is the most appropriate?

It is important to ensure the independent practice enables pupils to practise the new material you have taught them. Take a look at the scenario below and select the activity you think is the most appropriate.

### Scenario

The focus of the lesson is for pupils to shade 3D objects to show light and shadow. You begin the lesson by explaining how you can shade objects to show light and shadow. You use ‘Think Aloud’ to demonstrate your thought processes whilst modelling shading 3D compound shapes with light coming from one direction per shape. You then complete guided practice where you invite pupils to tell you which areas to shade darker and which areas to shade lighter and why. You then ask them to have a quick practice at their tables on a similar shape, addressing any misconceptions that you identify. You then decide pupils are ready to complete some extended independent practice.

$CTA

<h3>Which activity would you give them?</h3>
a) A sheet with a variety of 3D curved and compound shapes with light coming from
one direction per shape.
<h4>Feedback</h4>
This wouldn’t be the most appropriate form of independent practice as you have not
explained or modelled how to indicate curvature of a shape when shading. Therefore,
pupils will most likely find shading curved 3D shapes challenging and have a poor
success rate here. These shapes might be given as an extension activity to pupils
who have mastered shading 3D compound shapes, but you would need to model and explain
how shading curved shapes is slightly different.

b) Pupils draw 3D compound shapes to practise maths skills and then indicate the direction light is coming from. They then shade the shapes accordingly.

<h4>Feedback</h4>
This wouldn’t be the most appropriate form of independent practice as you did not
model how to draw 3D compound shapes. Therefore, the pupils may not be able to create
the right shapes. As a result, they might spend most of their independent practice
attempting to draw 3D compound shapes rather than practising the lesson focus – shading
to show light and shadow.

c) A sheet with a variety of different 3D compound shapes with light coming from one direction per shape.

<h4>Feedback</h4>
This would be an appropriate form of independent practice because it aligns well
with the guided practice pupils completed prior. Once pupils have mastered this,
then you might introduce some more variation such as two sources of light per shape
or shapes with curved surfaces. First you would model with narration and then send
them off to practise that variation. $CTA

When starting pupils off on a task, it is also important to check they understand what to do before they begin. This helps to ensure they can begin immediately. There are a number of ways you can do this, but one way is to ask pupils to repeat instructions back to you before setting them off.

## Reflection

$CTA
Think about an activity you recently set. Consider the following questions and record your response in your notepad.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How successful were pupils at this activity and why do you think that was?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is there anything you would do differently next time?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

## Providing further guides and scaffolds

Throughout a lesson, you will provide pupils with a large amount of scaffolding and support. This will firstly occur during your explanations and modelling and continue during guided practice. This helps to ensure pupils develop a strong understanding of the material you are teaching them.

When first setting up independent practice, you may need to continue to provide scaffolds to ensure pupils achieve a high level of success. These scaffolds will guide pupils through cognitive and metacognitive processes, which will help to break the tasks down into its constituent components without the direct input from a teacher. Before you explore different ways to do this, let’s recap what cognition and metacognition are.

### Cognition:

This is the thinking. It’s the thought processes involved in applying a cognitive strategy or approach to solving a problem or completing a task. For example, using long addition to find the sum of two numbers, or using a mnemonic to help you memorise a spelling.

### Metacognition:

This is the knowledge that pupils have about:

- the task they have been given
- the cognitive strategies they could use
- their own abilities

Pupils apply this knowledge when completing a task. This knowledge can be applied at three main stages. When:

- **Planning** how to tackle a problem or complete an activity.
- **Monitoring** how successful their approach is at solving the problem or completing an activity and adapting it if necessary
- **Evaluating** how successful they were at solving the problem or completing the task once it’s complete.

During guided practice, you should model both cognitive and metacognitive strategies by using ‘Think Aloud’ as you demonstrate, but pupils may still benefit from prompts that help to break tasks down into constituent components without your direct guidance or support. This can be done in a variety of ways, some of which you have already explored:

- You might provide pupils with **worked examples** to use as a point of reference when completing independent work to demonstrate the cognitive strategy or approach.
- You might provide pupils with **partially completed** examples to focus their thinking around the part of a cognitive strategy or approach you want to develop.
- You might provide pupils with a checklist to prompt cognitive and metacognitive thoughts.

As you have previously explored worked examples and partially completed examples in module two, this section will focus on using checklists.

## Checklists to scaffold cognitive processes

Using checklists can be an effective way to scaffold pupils’ cognition by ensuring they remain focused around the success criteria of a task.

This can help to break the task down into its constituent components and prompt students’ thinking during independent practice. The following examples demonstrate how this might look in different contexts:

$I

<h3>Literacy example:</h3>
If the independent practice requires pupils to describe a character using metaphors
and similes, the checklist might consist of the following:

Have I grouped my ideas into clear paragraphs?

Have I used a simile effectively using like or as? e.g. His smile is like a ray of sunshine. His smile is as radiant as the sun.

Have I used a metaphor effectively? E.g. Pools of blue and hazel stare steadily into the distance.

Have I re-read my work to check it makes sense?
$I

$I

<h3>Science example:</h3>
If independent practice is to balance chemical equations, the checklist might be:

Have I replaced the name of each substance with its symbol or formula?

Have I checked whether the equation is balanced?

If the equation is not balanced, have I used numbers to balance it?
$I

If you are in a setting where pupils can’t read yet, such as Early Years, you can use images as a visual prompt.

Providing pupils with a checklist for cognitive strategies acts as a scaffold to ensure that pupils remain focused on the key learning points. They help to break down the task into its parts and prompt pupils to consider their next steps.

These questions should be modelled by you during guided practice using ‘Think Aloud’ but displaying or giving pupils a checklist during independent practice can support pupils to take ownership over their learning as they are required to monitor and check their work.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This year, in English, I really wanted to make children’s planning of their
  writing more meaningful and something that they actually used. I noticed that
  all too often children would plan a piece of writing through a sequence of
  lessons but then almost abandon the plan and just try and write from memory.
  They would frequently go and get a SPAG checklist, or a year group assessment
  grid, and then write something that was often poorly organised and did not
  meet the purpose for the writing.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I wanted to give children a way to plan ideas for vocabulary and sentence
  structure, but also see clearly what should be in their writing so I decided
  to use a checklist to act as a prompt. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Before a piece of writing, I plan a checklist together with the children, that
  is specific to that piece of writing. We call it ‘ingredients for success’. As
  it is developed{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  the children, not just given to them, they take it very seriously. I always
  start the process off by adding some non- negotiables - these will be my
  specific aims for this piece of writing. For example, it might be to include
  speech, or to focus children on expanded noun phrases for description. From
  there the children will start to offer what they think should be included and
  we develop this together. Lastly, if they have been given a next step target
  from their last writing, for example - to remember commas in a list - they
  will add this to their own. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  What we include in the checklist varies from piece to piece, but means we have
  a very specific and relevant checklist to guide children through their
  writing. Pupils are encouraged to physically tick things off on their list as
  they go to keep them on track.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It also gives me the chance to give my children writing at greater depth a
  further challenge by adding other elements to their work. Similarly, I can
  remove elements from some children’s checklists to help keep them focused on
  the skills they need to work on.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Planning writing in this way has really helped children to develop
  independence in their writing. It did need a conscious investment of time at
  the outset. To begin with, children would sometimes come up with simple
  punctuation points. Now however, they are beginning to think for themselves
  about what makes a good piece of writing and will make much more thoughtful
  contributions, such as starting sentences in different ways. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  One other advantage of these more specific checklists is I can add specific
  targets for individual children very easily. For example, one child - although
  a good writer- was persistently using ‘and then’ in their writing. By adding
  this to their checklist, over a couple of pieces of writing, they have almost
  completely stopped doing this.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I have found checklists to be a vital resource when building pupil
  independence whilst still providing a form of scaffold.

## Checklists to scaffold metacognitive processes

Using a checklist can also be used to scaffold pupils’ metacognition during a task, which supports them to self-regulate their learning.

Here, checklists would include questions to support them during the planning, monitoring and evaluation phases of the work they are doing.

Below is an example of some questions you might use if the independent practice required pupils to complete a self-portrait. This example has been taken from[ Metacognition and Self-regulated learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/EEF_Metacognition_and_self-regulated_learning.pdf) (EEF, 2018).

### Questions during planning:

- ‘What resources do I need to carry out a self-portrait?’
- ‘Have I done a self-portrait before and was it successful?’ ‘What have I learned from the examples we looked at earlier?’
- ‘Where do I start and what viewpoint will I use?’
- ‘Do I need a line guide to keep my features in proportion?’

### Questions during monitoring:

- ‘Am I doing well?’
- ‘Do I need any different techniques to improve my self-portrait?’
- ‘Are all of my facial features in proportion?’
- ’Am I finding this challenging?’
- ‘Is there anything I need to stop and change to improve my self-portrait?’

### Questions during evaluation:

- ‘How did I do?’
- ‘Did my line guide strategy work?’
- ‘Was it the right viewpoint to choose?’
- ‘How would I do a better self-portrait next time?’
- ‘Are there other perspectives, viewpoints or techniques I would like to try?’

Displaying a checklist containing metacognitive prompts during independent practice supports pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their progress whilst they work without teacher guidance. This helps to build their metacognitive strategies and reminds them of the thought process that an expert would go through.

## Using collaborative practice to best effect

Rosenshine (2012 pg16) states that “an important finding from information-processing research is that students need to spend additional time rephrasing, elaborating and summarising new material in order to store this material in their long-term memory”. This suggests that discussion can be a powerful form of practice, and collaboration with peers presents opportunities for this to occur. Research shows that paired or group activities can increase pupil success (EEF, 2018), but what can you do to ensure it is effective?

### What makes effective collaboration?

There are some key features that can support effective collaboration:

- **Practice** – key skills of listening and responding need to be taught when asking pupils to talk to their partner or work as a group (EEF 2018). Pupils will not inherently know how to do this well. Therefore, you need to decide how you want pupils to work collaboratively and support pupils to do so effectively through clear instructions and practice.
- **Structured tasks** –tasks that are well structured and promote talk and interaction tend to have the greatest impact (EEF, 2018).
- **Prior knowledge** – as with any practice task, when working collaboratively, pupils must have all the knowledge they require in order to complete the task successfully (Enser, 2019).
- **Groupings** – it is important that you carefully select pupils who will work together well.

Collaborative learning is an effective way of encouraging and developing Talk in the classroom. Effective collaboration can support pupils to develop their understanding of a concept or topic as it provides pupils with an opportunity to hear and evaluate ideas that might be different to their own.

One example of when I used collaboration was when my class were looking at ‘Who was to blame for the death of Bess?’ in the text Highwayman in Year 6.

In order to set the ground rules for the lesson I ensured that I had gone over the talk rules and expectations for the lesson. At the time our main focus was to wait for a break in order to give our opinion so that we were not interrupting. My pupils were not used to this so this was an aspirational and challenging target. Prior to the lesson, I prepared pupils through circle time where we explored appropriate behaviours when discussing a topic such as waiting for an appropriate gap to speak and listening carefully in order to build on to a point or disagree respectfully.

The children worked in groups of 4 and each was assigned a role.  The group leader directed the conversation and ensured that all children were involved. The scribe participated in the discussion and recorded notes. The group member took part in the discussion and ensured that they were challenging the views of others if they didn’t agree. The reporter shared the group’s ideas with the rest of the class.  I find that groups of 4 are ideal as pupils have a shoulder partner (someone who is next to them) and a face partner (someone who is sat opposite them) so it makes it easier for them share and communicate their ideas and ensure all pupils’ voices are heard. The pupils had been using this structure for group work for about 4 weeks and were now using it well.

Prior learning of the group roles included group role cards to show the children what their expectations were in that role. I had created a video of a group of children executing the roles well from the previous year. This gave the children a good example of what this should look like. We also used the roles regularly in any talk focused scenario so that they began to build up their confidence in their role.

To ensure all pupils could meaningfully engage in the discussion, I ensured that the children had a clear understanding of the text that we were looking at. This had been a journey over 3-4 weeks in the build-up of work and unpicking of the text. I also ensured that they had a clear view of the characters throughout the text and we had built up character profiles by using ‘role on the wall’ for each character on the working wall that they could then draw upon to base their opinions around.

In order to support the children further, I then used the Tower Hamlets progression in Language Structures to create persuasive talk frames.  The children then built their opinions from evidence in the text and used the talk frames to convey these. At the same time, they practised waiting for the gap and using the talk rules that were the focus for that lesson. This enabled the children to have an in-depth conversation with high quality language and structure for support.

My role throughout was to listen to the children’s ideas and prompt their thinking when necessary to scaffold or extend their learning. For instance, one group thought they had come to a collective decision and all agreed straight away on who they believed was to blame. I then asked some questions to encourage further reflection and deeper thinking, which instigated a new line of enquiry.

Collaborative learning is something that I ensure is at the heart of every lesson within my class. I group pupils of mixed attainment into groups of four.  I always remind children of our talk rules before we begin to discuss our thoughts. This ensures the children are aware of the expectations when discussing their opinions and can do this respectfully.

Collaborative learning can be an excellent and productive learning experience for pupils; however, the caveat to this is that it has to be carefully planned and structured, with clearly defined stages or roles for each pupil taking part in the collaborative activity. Pupils also have to be prepared for the task in terms of having the required prior knowledge in order to successfully engage with the collaborative activity.

There are many ways to set up constructive collaborative activities. In my own classroom I use Kagan style collaborative structures where pupils are working in pairs or fours. These collaborative structures have very clear stages and instructions; pupils work collaboratively towards a common goal, but in a way that is very much directed by the teacher in terms of timings and moving through the steps of the activity.

One example of this is a <em>collaborative consensus activity.</em> This is where pupils are given a question or debating point that they first work on alone to gather their thoughts, and then are directed to discuss with their group. For example, with a recent Year 10 class, I gave pupils the statement: “Macbeth is a wholly evil character. Discuss”. First, I asked them to work independently to write down key points they thought were important. Then I signaled for each pupil to share their response in turn with their group. Their aim was to identify similarities <em>and</em> stimulate debate in order to craft a group consensus in response to the question or task. When directed, one member from each group shared their groups response to the class which led to a whole class discussion.

This task was a success because:

<ul>
  <li>Every pupil had a clear role to play</li>
  <li>
    The task was well structured - clear timings directed by the teacher ensured
    all pupils knew what to do and when
  </li>
  <li>
    Pupils had enough prior knowledge and understanding of the play and the
    character of Macbeth in order to engage effectively.
  </li>
</ul>
We could contrast this very structured approach with posing pupils a question and
then instructing them to, “Discuss it in groups” without giving them any structure.
I’ve made this mistake in the past - pupils lacked direction; some pupils did nothing;
some pupils dominated the conversation – ultimately, the task was unsuccessful and
of little benefit to a lot of pupils.

How should pupils be grouped? The makeup of groupings can be flexible. Generally, when I plan collaborative learning opportunities, my groups are made up of pupils with different attainment levels, but you may wish to group pupils otherwise and, of course, you should always consider potential behavioural or relationship issues that could manifest when pupils are working together.

Group work can serve a really useful function. It builds on and can help to develop pupils’ confidence, as well as ensuring effective preparatory thinking and planning before any high-stakes questioning or writing.

I use collaborative work frequently but one example of when I have done this is during a Year 11 English Literature revision lesson when we were exploring a key question related to the text, <em>A Christmas Carol</em>: ‘How is Scrooge presented at the beginning of the novel?’

The pupils were already sitting in mixed attainment groups of four and each have a number 1-4. I started with a ‘Think-Pair-Share' activity so that pupils had time to individually reflect on the question. I gave them 30 seconds to think and then one minute to write down their own ideas.  I then gave them two minutes to discuss their ideas with their partner who was sat next to them.  I then gave them a further four minutes to share their ideas with their partner sat opposite them which would lead to a group discussion where they would hopefully come to a consensus for the answer to the question.

I then wanted the class to explore how Scrooge is presented throughout the whole text. I asked pupils numbered 1 to focus stave (or chapter) 2, pupils number 2, to focus on stave 3, pupils numbered 3 to focus on stave 4 and pupils numbered 4 to focus on stave 5. I asked pupils work independently for 2 minutes to bullet point ideas about the presentation of Scrooge in their stave. After that. I asked the Number 1s to move to a designated table at the back of the room, the Number 2s to a table in the middle, the Number 3s to a table also in the middle, and the Number 4s to a table at the front. I ensure pupils make this transition quickly and quietly so that doesn’t waste learning time. As pupils have become more familiar with this transition, the routine has become quicker and more efficient.

In their new groups, I gave pupils 5 minutes to share ideas, to pass around their bullet points, to add to their lists and so on. When they are doing this, I circulate the room to support, stretch groups and individual pupils where necessary, focusing on those who require the most support.

When the timer finishes, pupils move back to their original groups and have one minute each to share their notes with the rest of the group. During this phase, it’s quite normal and lovely to hear praise, applause and other positive modes of feedback that the pupils give to each other. After this, I took whole-class feedback by asking individuals to share their points and discussed these as a class.

I find collaboration a great way to scaffold pupils learning and have noticed it works best when tasks are well structured, pupils are familiar with any routines involved and when pupils have the prior knowledge required to meaningfully engage the tasks set.

## Gradually removing scaffolding

Whilst it is important to provide scaffolds when first setting up independent practice, it is important that you remove those scaffolds over time to increase the challenge and ensure pupils develop complete independence.

Choose one of the videos below to listen as a teacher talks through an example of how they removed scaffolding over time to increase pupil independence.

When revising multiplying and dividing by 10, 100 and 1000, I noticed that a small group of pupils were still struggling to grasp this concept, particularly when decimals were involved. The scaffold I used was this number slider<strong> (resource to be shown</strong>) so that when working out a calculation, the pupils could use the scaffold to see what was actually happening to the place value of the digits  when being multiplied or divided.

While the pupils were using the slider, I asked them questions to check and deepen their understanding, such as: what has happened to the value of the numbers? Which direction are they moving in? How many places do they need to be moved and how do you know? These questions helped to scaffold pupils learning by breaking down the process into small components so they could understand each step.

After they had used the slider, I asked the pupils to record the calculation in their books and then write the answer directly underneath it. Their answer was then represented in the squares on the page as well as on the slider. It was at this point I asked them to look at the squares in their maths book and we discussed how the movement of the digits could also be represented by the squares.

By transitioning from the concrete tool – the slider- to the use of the squares in a maths book, I reduced the level of scaffold given to pupils. Using squares in the maths book made pupils think harder about the direction the numbers should move and how many places they should be moved because they no longer had a concrete tool to manipulate.

It’s important that scaffolds like this are eventually removed entirely, as pupils need to be able to answer questions like this independently, to ensure they fully master the concept and skill.

After independent practice, the pupils were able to confidently multiply and divide by 10, 100 and 1000 without a concrete resource. They now use the squares in their maths books as a guide if they need to and, when doing this without squared paper, they know they can quickly draw a grid, like this one <strong>(show an example of the grid)</strong> if necessary, to help them ‘move’ the digits. The use of a concrete tool transitioned to a mental strategy that pupils can draw upon when needed.

Both within a lesson and throughout a series of lessons, it is important that there is a logical progression. This often takes the form of initially presenting new information through explanations and models, practicing new material and skills it in a collaborative way and then providing pupils time for independent work. Throughout this process scaffolding should be provided then eventually removed as pupils’ knowledge develops and they require a greater level of challenge. To support pupils to be successful in their work, I try to be consistent in the strategies and structures I use to explain key concepts. I find this helps to build pupils confidence and consequently, their motivation.

When teaching pupils how to write in French I break it down into its components parts by first teaching them the key structures that build a basic sentence, then how to extend a simple sentence and finally how to construct paragraphs and extended pieces of writing.

When teaching these components, I initially provide pupils with a scaffold to support their practise. The scaffolds I provide are writing frames to support with sentence structure, and vocabulary prompts to support with translation. Pupils can use the vocabulary prompts to change key components in the writing frame such as adjectives, verbs, connectives and opinions.

During guided and independent practice, pupils use these writing frames and vocabulary prompts to support them to construct their own sentences whilst following the correct grammatical structures.

Over time, I reduce the level of support provided in the writing frame by removing the amount of words or structures given and challenge pupils to recall the structures from their memory which helps to build their learning and independence until eventually, they no longer require writing structures to support them.

What is important to note in this example is that the principle of progression from formulating basic sentences to extending sentences remains the same. Once these structures are stored in pupil's long-term memory, they can recall them and draw upon them when learning about new topics or vocabulary. Using the same writing frames and structures each time, supports all pupils, particularly those who are lower attaining in French, as it allows for increased practice and therefore increased success.

Removing scaffolding in Secondary history - Alex Fairlamb at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust

One example of when I used scaffolding and then gradually removed it was when I tasked my pupils with answering a source utility question. This is one of the more complex History skills as it requires pupils to study sources and determine how useful they are for a given enquiry by evaluating their content and source. Therefore, I scaffolded learning by first modelling how to approach answering a question like this and then gradually removed this scaffold throughout the lesson.

To begin with, I broke down the question for them into its component parts by using a technique called ‘RUSS the question’ – ‘Read it, underline it, summarise it, then solve it.’  I then began to use ‘Think Aloud’ to model unpacking what the question is asking. For example, by saying “What does ‘How’ mean – I know from previous lessons that it means you’re required to give a judgement.”

I then began to model how to structure the response.  First of all, I modelled checking the question and mapping out where the different components would appear in my answer by saying things like:

“What are the key words in the question?  What do those key words mean and what therefore is the question asking me to do?  I’m going to now summarise the question by making a checklist for this question so that I can ensure that I have included everything that it is asking of me – I must include: three paragraphs, evidence from my own knowledge and I must include explanation.

After this, I began to model completing the task, demonstrating my metacognition by thinking aloud what I was doing, how and why.  During this stage of the lesson, I began to remove scaffolding and support by asking pupils to contribute as I modelled completing the task. This enabled me to guide and support their responses. Once I felt pupils were secure in their understanding of how to answer this question, I tasked pupils with independent practice.

For the independent practice, I provided pupils with a partially completed example to continue to scaffold their responses. This further reinforced their understanding of the different elements of the question and ensured their thinking was focused around the key learning points.

So throughout the lesson, I gradually removed the scaffold of teacher support to increase pupil independence. During independent practise, pupils were not expected to work entirely without scaffolds and instead were given a partially completed example because I knew they would require some form of support. However, over time, depending on the pupil and their progress, I began to remove scaffolds for source utility questions. I began by transitioning from a partially completed example to using checklists to support and prompt pupil’s cognitive and metacognitive processes. Once pupils had internalised the structure and processes involved, I was able to remove the checklists entirely. The speed at which this was done varied for different pupils to suit their differing needs. To further support pupil independence, I ensure I consistently use the same structures when answering questions.

I always challenge pupils to progress to independence - the scaffolding must begin to come down at some point - but when appropriate. Don’t be fearful to put scaffolds back into place if errors are made and it is required.

The level of scaffold and the length of time you provide pupils with will depend on the task and the pupil’s current understanding. Therefore, it will most likely look different for different pupils. This will be explored further in module five.

## Session overview

Questioning is an essential part of effective classroom practice and can be utilised throughout lessons for many different purposes.

To support you to use questioning effectively, in this session you will explore:

- Why is questioning important?

- Questioning to assess understanding

  - Avoid self-report questions

  - Check whole class understanding

  - Wait time

- Extending and challenging pupils

  - Do not complete pupils’ answers
  - Ask follow-up questions

## Why is questioning important?

High-quality classroom talk is a powerful tool for learning (EEF, 2019). It can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate learning and extend their vocabulary. This is supported by Rosenshine (2012) as he found that the most effective teachers spent more than half of the class time explaining, modelling and asking questions. Questioning is a vital teacher tool for two main reasons (Rosenshine, 2012):

- It enables you to assess pupils’ understanding to determine whether there is a need for additional instruction.
- It enables you to provide pupils the opportunity to practise what is being taught to consolidate and extend learning.

$Content
Muijs and Reynolds tell us that due to its importance, questioning is one of the most widely studied elements in teaching research. Questioning is a crucial element of effective instruction and can be used throughout the lesson. For example, it may be used during retrieval practice which might occur at the beginning of a lesson. Questioning can also be used during an explanation or during modelling to gauge whether information has been understood. Questioning is a vital and flexible tool at any part of a lesson. Questioning is essential to great teaching and should be interactive and responsive. Sherrington provides what he calls the ‘Relevant instructional procedures of questioning’. They are:

<ol>
  <li>Ask a large number of questions and check for understanding</li>
  <li>Ask students to explain what they have learned</li>
  <li>Check the response of all students</li>
  <li>Provide systematic feedback and corrections</li>
</ol>
So questioning helps us do a lot. It's essential to be a good questioner as a teacher
and again it needs lots and lots of practice. Our questions can help us gauge many
things, from how well the pupils understand, to whether we need to reteach something,
to whether pupils have understood a complex concept. We need to ask loads of questions
and involve loads of pupils. We may need to take more time near lesson to explain
something further if our questioning has shown us that pupils don't really get it.
Questioning enables us to be responsive teachers and to act on the information we
glean from our pupils. Questioning is really key and as Rosenshine found less successful
teachers ask fewer questions and almost no process questions. There's an array of
questioning strategies that you can employ in your teaching. It's worth focusing
on a few and practicing them until you're more comfortable and they come more naturally.
Practice is key.

In this session you'll explore how to check pupils’ understanding by asking pupils a number of different questions and gaining feedback about what they understand. As Rosenshine and Sherrington emphasize this reinforces the need to present material in small steps. If there's too much at once then errors and misconceptions will potentially occur more frequently. Therefore chunked explanations supported by models and reinforced by regular questioning and checking for understanding is vital.

## Questioning to assess understanding

Assessing understanding is an essential part of teaching as it gives you an insight about the level of knowledge pupils have. It should be used throughout explanations to check whether you need to re-teach the step you have just introduced or move onto the next.

Assessing understanding can be challenging to get right. In order to appreciate how to check for understanding effectively, it is helpful to consider what constitutes poor practice to highlight strategies to avoid. Rosenshine (1982), cited in Rosenshine’s Principles in Action (2019 pg31) highlights that the wrong way to check for understanding is:

> “…to ask only a few questions, call on volunteers to hear their (usually correct) answers, and then assume that all of the class either understands or has now learned from hearing the volunteers’ responses. Another error is to ask, ‘Are there any questions?’ and, if there aren’t any, assume that everybody understands. Another error is to assume that it is not necessary to check for understanding, and simply repeating the points will be sufficient.”
>
> Rosenshine (2019)

Checking for, and building, understanding through questioning is a vital process that should occur continuously throughout the lesson. Below are some key features of checking for understanding that should be incorporated into your questioning, which will be explored in this session:

- Avoid self-report questions - ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught
- Check whole class understanding
- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response

## Avoid self-report questions

Self-report questions are generally the rhetorical questions which ask pupils to tell you whether they understand or not, such as:

“Is everyone clear on…?” or “Does that make sense…?”

These are the types of questions that Rosenshine recommends you avoid asking because such rhetorical questions typically generate a passive “yes” response and do not inform you about what they have understood or any misconceptions they may have developed.

Pupils are likely to give a passive response for a number of possible reasons:

- Embarrassment – pupils are less likely to stop the teaching to say they don’t understand.
- Pupils aren’t aware of what they don’t know – because pupils are novices in the topic you are teaching, they are unlikely to be aware of misconceptions or inaccurate knowledge they may be developing.
- Pupils might find it hard to reflect on the question of whether they have understood something.

To avoid asking rhetorical questions that don’t give accurate detail about pupil understanding, you should ask carefully chosen questions that are directly linked to the material you are teaching.

  <li>

    understanding?
  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

## Check whole class understanding

Rosenshine suggests that the wrong way to check for understanding is to call on only a few pupils who have volunteered their answers and then assume the rest of the class have the same level of understanding. This is because such a method doesn’t capture the understanding of the whole class. There may be pupils who do not understand the material you have taught but have not revealed this because they haven’t been asked to demonstrate their understanding. Therefore, it is important that you plan opportunities throughout your explanation to allow all pupils to show you their level of understanding.

One way to check whole class understanding is to ask pupils to show evidence of their understanding.

There are two ways in which you can do this:

### 1. Multiple choice

Here you give pupils answers to a question with a corresponding letter (a, b, c… ) or number ( 1, 2, 3… ). Pupils choose which answer they think is correct and when asked to, they show this to you _at the same time_ using fingers or by scribing the letter or number on their whiteboards. You then scan their fingers/whiteboards to check for their responses.

### 2. Individual response

Here pupils are not given multiple choice options. Instead, they show their working out or record their answer on a mini whiteboard and when asked to, they reveal this to you _at the same time._ Although it can take longer to scan pupils’ answers, the process can still reveal misunderstandings.

It is important you ask pupils to show you their answer _in unison_ to prevent them from copying one another. If they copy someone else’s idea, you don’t have an accurate understanding of how that pupil’s learning is progressing.

Once pupils have revealed their answer, you should target certain pupils and ask them to explain why they have given or chosen that answer, especially if pupils have given a mixed response. This will highlight where misconceptions have formed which you can then directly address.

## Wait time

When assessing pupils’ understanding, it is important that you allow pupils _enough_ time to consider the question and generate a response.

Therefore, when asking questions, it is important you leave thinking time between asking the question and calling on the pupil who you wish to answer. This has two benefits:

- It gives pupils time to think about your questions and apply their understanding to generate a suitable response.
- By naming the pupil _after_ asking the question, you encourage _all_ pupils to be ready with an answer because they don’t know who you will call upon.

## Extending and challenging pupils

Whilst questioning should be used to check understanding, it can also be used to extend and challenge pupils. This can be particularly tricky to get right and relies on you as a teacher maintaining high expectations of pupil responses. There are two things you can incorporate into your questioning to maintain high expectations of pupils and build their understanding of the material being taught. You can:

- Ensure you do not complete pupils’ answers for them. By extending their answer with your own ideas, you are lowering your expectations of what a good answer is and assuming pupils know more than they do
- Ask pupils follow-up questions which encourage them to build on their answer to extend and challenge them

## Do not complete pupil’s answers

One way to ensure you maintain high expectations of pupil responses is to ensure you ask follow-up questions to an incomplete answer rather than completing the answer for the pupils.

Often teachers, unknowingly, complete or ‘round-up’ pupils incomplete answers and then reward the pupil for their answer even though it wasn’t entirely their response.

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
Teacher: How do I know that the answer will be an integer if I divide 1230 by 10?

Pupil: Because it ends in a zero.

Teacher: Right. 1230 ends in a zero meaning it is a multiple of 10.
$I

The teacher has added extra information but still indicated the pupil gave the correct response. The consequence is that pupils believe they are right and fully understand when they may not.

### Asking further questions to enable the pupil to complete or build upon their answer

It can be difficult not to round-up pupils answers as you want to keep the pace of the lesson and praise pupils for sharing their ideas. However, if you don’t address partially correct answers and probe for more detail then you have lowered your expectations of pupils and don’t provide them with an opportunity to extend their leaning.

The best way to avoid doing this is to ensure _you_ know what a good answer would be before asking the question. For example, it may be that the pupils need to give three specific pieces of information. Knowing this helps you identify _exactly_ what you want pupils to say. If/when they don’t provide you with a full answer, you can probe further.

Ways you can further probe a pupil’s thinking will be explored in the following section.

Teacher questioning is a powerful tool in the classroom. One of the key aims of teacher questioning is creating a sense of accountability for all pupils and generating a learning environment that is high challenge for all pupils regardless of ability.  Probing for more detail can help us achieve this goal.

This is about us, as teachers, having high expectations of the answers that pupils give in response to our questioning. We don’t accept half formed or inaccurate answers: we push for the best possible answer.

We can do this in a number of ways:

<ul>
  <li>through further probing</li>
  <li>
    by using wait time effectively, giving the pupil a moment to rearticulate
    their response and repeat their improved answer
  </li>
  <li>
    by questioning other members of the class and then asking the original pupil
    again. This gives them time to listen, reflect and refine their answer.
  </li>
</ul>
In a recent lesson on Macbeth, we were doing some close analysis of a quotation.
A pupil that I questioned gave a partially correct answer about a crucial plot event
in the play. They indicated that Lady Macbeth, “Puts the blame on someone else for
what Macbeth did” (in terms of Duncan’s murder). I wanted a fuller and more detailed
answer than this. I asked the pupil to reread a speech by Lady Macbeth where this
plot detail is covered and then unpicked the key parts of the speech with the pupil
through further questioning, by asking questions like:
<ul>
  <li>“What did Lady Macbeth do with the bloody daggers?”</li>
  <li>“Why did she do this?”</li>
  <li>
    “What was the impact of these actions after Duncan’s body was discovered?”
  </li>
</ul>
After this probing questioning, I then returned to the key question of who Lady Macbeth
intentionally frames for Duncan’s murder. This probing ensured that we eventually
got to the full answer.

As teachers, we might be tempted to accept poorly formed answers, or even inaccurate answers to appear encouraging to pupils or to avoid disrupting the pace or flow of a lesson. However, we can’t allow misconceptions or errors to become embedded – that is the danger if we don’t insist on challenging incorrect or partially formed answers.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Describe an example of when you rounded up a pupil’s answer. Explain why you think
you did it, what impact this had on pupil understanding and what you could have asked
instead. $CTA

## Ask follow-up questions

When pupils give a correct answer, you can increase the challenge and extend their understanding by giving them further, more complex questions such as:

- Ask how or why
- Ask for another way to answer
- Ask for better vocabulary
- Ask pupils to integrate a related skill

These can be used in all subjects and phases.

## Ask how or why

Rosenshine (2012) found that more successful teachers ask more process questions. Asking pupils to explain how or why they have come to an answer is an example of a process question as it checks pupils reasoning and working-out. This is a simple way to stretch pupils’ answers.

By doing this, you are:

- Checking pupils’ level of understanding and possibly revealing otherwise hidden misconceptions.
- Extending their understanding by asking pupils to verbalise their thinking - elaboration helps pupils to build mental models.

$I
Below is an example of what this might look like in practice:

Teacher: What is the perimeter of the square?

Pupil: 20 metres.

Teacher: How do you know?

Pupil: Because all the sides add up to 20.

Teacher: How did you know the length of all the sides?

Pupil: Because one side was 5 metres and because it’s a square, all sides are the same length.

Teacher: So…

Pupil: So, all the sides are 5 metres and 4 times 5 equals 20.
$I

Here, the teacher has pushed the pupil to reveal their deeper understanding by asking ‘how’ questions. It has helped the pupil make links with other knowledge, enabling them to provide a comprehensive answer.

## Ask for another way to answer

Sometimes there is more than one way to give an answer. You can check pupil understanding by asking them to give another way of solving a problem or explaining their reasoning.

Teacher: Fill in the blanks: \_\_+ \_\_ = 4

Pupil: Three plus one equals four

Teacher: Can you think of another way to make four?

Pupil: Another way to make four is two plus two.

Teacher: What if one was the first number in the equation? 1 + \_\_ = 4

Pupil: One plus three equals four.

By doing this, you help pupils to build links within their knowledge and deepen their understanding of the concept, which in this case was addition.

## Ask for better vocabulary or more precise expression

Pupils often provide answers in the simplest language, especially when they are unfamiliar with certain vocabulary. A great way to enhance vocabulary is by probing pupils to improve their language choices and use target vocabulary. In Early Years, it might look like this:

Teacher: Why was mouse scared?
Pupil: Because he saw a cat.
Teacher: Because he saw a what cat? Can you use an adjective to describe it?
Pupil: Because he saw a scary cat.

By including the ‘what’, the teacher has supported the pupil by indicating where the descriptive word should go in the sentence, providing a scaffold for their next response. In older age pupils the prompting might be slightly different:

Teacher: Why was the mouse scared?
Pupil: Because he saw a cat.
Teacher: Can you use two adjectives to describe the cat?
Pupil: Because he saw a large, scary cat.
Teacher: OK, how about using one of our vocabulary words?
Pupil: Because he saw a large, menacing cat.

Here the teacher has prompted the pupil to challenge themselves and improve their initial response. In other subjects or contexts, you might use the same structure to encourage pupils to use subject specific or technical language.

## Ask pupils to integrate a related skill

To help pupils build connections between their learning from one lesson to the next, you can ask pupils to integrate one skill with another they have recently mastered. The example below demonstrates how this might look in a primary P.E lesson:

Teacher: Who can show me a narrow movement?
Pupil: Walks around with arms up high.
Teacher: Who can show me a low, narrow movement.
Pupil: Slithers narrowly on the floor.
Teacher: Who can show me a low, rolling narrow movement.
Pupil: completes a pencil roll.

By doing this, you are joining up pupils’ learning and connecting new learning with existing knowledge in their mental model, in this case, of how to move your body in different ways.

## What does this look like in practice?

There are many ways you can extend pupils’ understanding when they present correct answers. Watch the video of a teacher challenging pupils with follow-up questions to extend their understanding. Whilst watching, consider the following questions and then record your response in your notepad:

## Summary

Questioning is a vital tool to use within the classroom as it enables you to both assess pupils’ understanding and extend pupils’ learning. To use questioning to best effect, there are some principles to consider:

- Avoid self-report questions - ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught
- Check whole class understanding
- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response
- Do not complete pupils’ answers
- Ask follow-up questions to extend and challenge pupils
- Will pupils' benefit from scaffolds such as sentence frames when answering questions?

In your next mentor session and training session, you will explore questioning further and will plan questioning into a future lesson.

In the following week, you will then be observed using questioning to assess pupils understanding and extend and challenge pupils.

Scaffolding is the term that refers to a variety of instructional techniques and resources that are used to move pupils toward stronger understanding and, ultimately, greater independence in the learning process

Three key things that have supported me across the curriculum to scaffold learning are:

<ul>
  <li>
    Worked examples, sometimes known as WAGGOLS which stands for ‘What A Good
    One Looks Like’
  </li>
  <li>Checklists</li>
  <li>Thinking aloud</li>
</ul>
Worked examples or WAGOLLs are brilliant resources that demonstrate the final outcome
expected to pupils. They can be used to model the skills and standards expected through
shared or guided writing, or they can simply be shared with your pupils who might
find it challenging when conceptualising the expected outcome of a task. These WAGOLLs
can then be displayed as a visual prompt for learners to access throughout the sequence
of lessons and support them in magpie-ing ideas for their own work.

Checklists are amazing. Giving pupils a checklist of criteria to meet when answering a question or completing a task is a really simple but massively effective way of scaffolding. A checklist provides a visual prompt and gives pupils an idea of how many steps they need to take to be successful, as well as the order in which they should take them.

‘Thinking aloud’ or verbalising your thought processes as you complete a task is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate to pupils how they can apply their skills and prior learning to support them in achieving the learning goal. Talking through the steps and orally rehearsing example phrases shows pupils that answers aren’t automatic and take careful thought and planning. It’s also important to allow the pupils time to do this with their peers. Orally rehearsing the steps that they might go through first and giving feedback to each other before putting pen to paper is a really effective way of developing their metacognition and  supporting them achieve.

Once pupils have been successful at a task using scaffolds, it’s important to challenge the learners to become more independent in their work. Over time, physical scaffolds should be removed so pupils don’t become dependent on them and, instead, internalise the scaffold so they can draw upon it whenever they need. If we think of a house that has scaffolding round it, we wouldn’t want to keep the scaffolding up once the work had been completed! We would want to show off all the work that has gone on in developing it!

The first thing I would say when removing scaffolds is, it’s really important not to take away everything all at once. I would often start by reducing one element from my scaffolding bank, for instance: covering up the WAGOLL, or reducing the thinking aloud to just ‘thinking time’, where pupils have time to plan the next stage of their work independently, whilst keeping all of the other components there. I would often vary this for different learners, depending on their needs. For instance, I found that children who struggle with processing, benefit from discussing things out-loud more frequently, so I grouped these pupils together and encouraged the rest of the class to work independently using the checklist and WAGOLL alone. I would always remove the checklist last, and only when I was sure the items on them had been achieved whilst using it. To <em>slowly</em> remove the scaffold that the checklist provided, I wouldn’t take away the whole thing, but instead would leave gaps in the checklist according to my assessment of what the pupils were attaining. I then slowly reduced the number of items on there until pupils were completing the task independently. I would always build periods of reflection into this process whereby pupils could assess their progress against in their independent piece and make amendments where necessary.

If there is one thing which I used constantly with all of my learners when I was teaching it was scaffolds.  Now these could range from structured frameworks for accessing for exploring written text to a mind map for ideas which developed into a body of text. Scaffold's don't make the content easier, they create access to that content and help pupils, particularly those with literacy difficulties, to demonstrate the richness of their answers on paper.

It is important to consider the idea of cognitive load, when focusing on the purpose of a scaffold. Cognitive load theory by Sweller (1988) is a way of thinking about the total amount of information which a person is dealing with and processing at any time. For example, if you have a learner that finds reading text difficult but the objective of that lesson is to comprehend that text, a learner’s cognitive load may be taken up with the process of reading, decoding the words, the speed of reading, the length of the text, the familiarity of the text or the stress of doing something which they perceive as a challenge rather than the set task of comprehending.

This is where scaffolding comes in. That same learner, if they are aware of some of the complex vocabulary that they will be reading in that text, if they have been given some guidance on how to scan a text and read it for meaning or signposted to the areas of text which they need to read closely or if they have been modelled how to read through that text and identify the areas by highlighting parts of the text to aid comprehension later in the lesson.  Everything I've just described could be a scaffold, none of them make the content any easier but the process of reading has become easier and thus the working memory load has more capacity for the teaching material.

Another example of a good scaffold to use and one which I have recommended several times to the schools that I work with is a task planner. This really helps those learners with literacy difficulties but also those that struggle with organization as it allows them to make sense of what they need to do. It also enables them to tick off what they've achieved in the lesson and for you, as a teacher, to see whether they are ready to move on from a scaffold.

This is an example of making the implicit, explicit through the use of concrete examples. Sharing those planning techniques that we may take for granted as teachers.  The education endowment foundation in their metacognition and self-regulated learning resource make reference to research supporting the idea that those learners who find learning difficult do not use these kinds of scaffolds and strategies inherently as some more successful learners do. Teaching those learners these kinds of strategies is not giving them an advantage its equipping them with useful strategies they can continue to use in their learning.

Let me finish off by giving you some examples of strategies for planning, drafting and editing.

When planning, mind mapping is fantastic for getting ideas down quickly and this can then be extended by linking the ideas and prioritising them using numbers to then create a plan.

When drafting writing, having an expectation of what the finished article will look like to demonstrate how the piece of text should start and what content should be included in the body will help a learner frame their ideas. It is important to explicitly teach different purposes of writing and how these impact upon the writing structure, for example, teaching pupils what a compare and contrast essay would be like or what a newspaper article would look like. When doing this you can use effective questioning to draw out known information.

Finally both when writing and editing work, using a checklist can act as a great scaffold. For example, when I was teaching, I would often suggest to their learners in exams to put the punctuation at the top of the page and whilst they were writing tick them off. Being able to critically look at your own piece of work is difficult, and editing is hard at any age so having a criterion to check your work against helps make the implicit explicit.

The ability of pupils to apply their learning in a new context is the benchmark that something has been learnt. According to Hattie “learning is the process of developing sufficient surface knowledge to then move to a deeper understanding such that one can appropriately transfer this learning to new tasks and situations”. Independent practice is used to develop this deeper understanding.

In order to prepare your pupils for independent practice and to help them achieve meaningful success, you should provide clear explanations and models to develop the pupils understanding of necessary foundational knowledge and skills.

When pupils are engaging in independent practice, you should be the ‘thermostat’ in the room. You should provide assessment opportunities to identify when to turn the temperature up and increase the challenge given to pupils, and when to turn the temperature down and provide additional support or re-teach material to help pupils master challenging content.

Independent practice is the long-term goal for all teachers because it is the point in the teaching cycle where teachers can accurately access if pupils “have got it”.

## Session Overview

Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.

This session will focus on:

- Understanding what makes effective assessment
- Deciding on the purpose of your assessments
- Ensuring that your assessment tasks are linked to the lesson objective

## Why is good assessment critical and what makes it effective?

In some form or another, assessment is being carried out by the teacher almost every minute of the lesson Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and learning needs.

The function of assessment sounds relatively simple; find out what the pupil knows, and doesn’t know, and plan subsequent opportunities to impart the relevant knowledge or skills based on the identified need. And yet, it can be a challenge to reliably assess a pupil’s level of understanding. For example, an ‘on-task’ child may appear to understand their learning, yet the work they are so busily producing may be full of errors based on an unidentified misconception. In the same way, only by removing the learning scaffold from a seemingly confident pupil, might you discover that they cannot replicate the learning in a standardised test – implying that the knowledge was not firmly encoded into the long-term memory in the first place. It is therefore critical that you have a clear understanding of what makes assessment effective in order to best support impactful teaching and learning decisions.

Good assessment provides teachers with reliable information about pupils’ understanding. However, for this information to be of real value, the teacher must use it effectively to inform feedback and support pupils to move forward.

Watch Professor Rob Coe as he explains why assessment is such a powerful teaching and learning tool, and what information it can give you about your pupils. Add any thoughts or reflections in the space provided below.

Dillan William defines assessment as the bridge between teaching and learning. The key insight is this: just because you’ve taught it, don’t assume they’ve learnt it. In general, complex processes like teaching and learning need feedback to ensure that they’re on track. Assessment gives feedback about two kinds of things. Firstly, whether specific ideas have been understood, knowledge has been absorbed, integrated, connected, retained, and procedures can be performed fluently. This is often quite granular and specific. Second, the overall status and progress. Am I on track? What is the gap between actual and desired performance?

Feedback is a key element of assessment and feedback can act in a number of ways. The simplest may just be correction – points out things that were wrong that could easily be corrected. Slightly more complex is guidance – we give students advice or activities that are tailored to their needs. Sometimes though, even that is not enough. A common mistake is to try and give feedback when what is really needed is instruction. If a student has not understood a key idea, then just feedback may not be enough.

Most learning and thinking is not directly visible so assessment is our only window. We ask questions to find out what is in learner’s heads. It’s useful to think about this in terms of information. Each individual question provides limited information, so we need to ask lots. Good assessment gives us information that is accurate and trustworthy. Teachers need to understand in principle what makes assessments accurate and trustworthy and, specifically for any given assessment that they want to use, how good it is.

Classroom assessment is powerful if it helps to inform and improve decisions and actions. This is always a matter of professional judgement – the teacher has to decide. But information from assessments can help to make it a better-informed decision. For example, the kinds of decisions teachers might make include:

<ul>
  <li>Does this individual student need specific support or help?</li>
  <li>Does a group need additional help or input?</li>
  <li>If I teach this again, could I do it better?</li>
</ul>
It’s important to understand that assessment can serve a number of different purposes.
Designing good assessments and judging whether an assessment is high quality crucially
depends on knowing the purpose. $EndContent $EndAccordion

As highlighted by Rob Coe, good assessment gives teachers a window into their pupils’ minds. The questions that are asked and the tasks that are set provide insight into the information that has been processed and subsequently stored in the long-term memory. Throughout the video he also emphasises the importance of the two -way nature of feedback. For the teacher, good assessment makes clear the knowledge that has been understood. It also gives the teacher information as to whether they need to reteach concepts or work further with a small group. For the pupil, feedback provides a way to move forward with their learning and helps them to develop secure mental models around a concept.

In order to ensure that the information you gather is accurate, Rob stresses that it is crucial to know the **purpose** of the assessment. The next section will explore how you might decide on the purpose of your assessments.

## What makes assessment effective?

### Deciding on the purpose of the assessment

You will most likely have come across the terms ‘formative’ and ‘summative’ assessment during your initial teacher training.

The concept of formative assessment was made popular by Dylan Wiliam and Paul Black, who defined formative assessment as when teachers ‘use evidence of student learning to adapt teaching and learning, and instruction, to meet a student’s needs’ (Inside the Black Box, 1998). As such, it is generally used to** inform future** learning or teaching. In some instances, formative feedback can be immediate, and pupils are able to act on it instantly.

‘Summative’ assessment is a term usually used to describe assessment **carried out at the end** of a period of learning, as a way of ‘summing-up’ what a pupil knows. Results of a summative assessment may often be shared as a grade or level description (e.g. Emerging), and generally offer a shared meaning on pupil performance.

So very crudely formative assessment is generally understood as using assessment to inform future learning or teaching and I tend to stress both learning and teaching. It usually means the use of assessment to check learning has taken place. And is it the learning that we intended it if not what are we going to do directly about this. In short, it has to influence further development. It could involve the learner alone, identifying an area or gap in their knowledge by checking his or her own work, or against an exemplar, or in a conversation with a peer but this really does need structure. Or it might be the teacher asking probing questions to check that learning has taken place and used identify gaps or misconceptions. But either way the action requires a further action.

Summative assessment conversely is usually a term used to describe an assessment at the end of a period of learning. For example, at the end of a topic, at the end of the year or the end of a course to show what has been achieved or not. These outcomes often use information such as marks, grades, pass/fail, merits/distinction. But no other detail is given back to the end-user. But although it's worth trying to understand what people actually mean when they use such terms, I wouldn't get too attached to either of these terms as types of assessment because they're not types. In reality these terms describe in quite blunt terms and very broad terms a purpose to which we put a particular assessment.

Paul Newton listed I think about twenty-two purposes for assessment so the starting point has to be around the purpose. As for educational assessment, be it about questioning, about teaching session, designing the written examination or test, the key questions are ‘What really are we trying to assess? Why we're trying to assess it and what are we going to do with the outcomes. How are we going to record or share the outcomes with other people?’ Then you can ask about the best way that this can be achieved.

Allocating labels like formative, often refer to Assessment for Learning, and summative, often referred to as Assessment of Learning, is quite blunt approach and can actually be misleading. For example, in so-called summative assessment, for example, a GCSE or a Key Stage Two test even here there are formative possibilities. Both of these assessments result in production of analysis. Item analysis where you can get look at the performance of individual questions, so for example you could analyse the outcome of the questions to see how your school or pupils did on question one compared to question three. And that might be something about how we taught the topic or even did we even teach that topic? The outcome of this investigation may not be formative for the pupils, they've now left the school. But the analysis might help the teacher to identify areas of weakness in the teacher’s knowledge gaps. Of course coverage. That could be considered as formative in a sense. At least in my view because that would inform future teaching and probably some professional development for the teacher.

So for me these terms describe the use to which a particular assessment is put – rather than being a type of assessment. In that the same testing someone could be used for either purpose in effect. A particular concern, least to me, is that these terms are too often presented as being polarised as though if there were at some different ends of a spectrum and in opposition. But in reality they're not you could use one test one question and they put the outcome to different purposes. So they're not types of assessment but the dependent on the inferences that we take, the conclusions that we reach or we draw on the evidence that we've elicited from our assessment. So be wary of labels and focus on what it is that you want to assess and what you want to get out of an assessment.

As highlighted by Mike, effective assessment has a purpose, and before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision that the results will be used to support, and able to justify its use. When deciding on which assessment to use, consider the following questions to help you select which method is going to be most effective:

$I

<ul>
  <li>What are you trying to assess?</li>
  <li>Why are you trying to assess this?</li>
  <li>What are you going to do with the information?</li>
  <li>How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?</li>
</ul>
$I

Although it is certainly important to be aware of the terminology surrounding assessment, when considering what is effective in assessment, Mike highlights the possibility of using summative assessments in a formative way (for example, working on a single exam question during a lesson), or use information you have gathered in your formative assessment in your summative judgments. He instead asks teachers to focus on the purpose for the assessment, and to be clear on the decision it will be used to support.

### Activity

A teacher has reflected on the purpose of an assessment opportunity they have planned for their next lesson.

They answered the four questions in the following way:

#### What are you trying to assess?

I _want to assess whether my pupils have grasped the concept of a coordinating conjunction._

#### Why are you trying to assess this?

_I am assessing their knowledge of this for two reasons:_

1. _To determine which, if any, of my pupils are ready for independent practice._
2. _To help me decide where to direct my attention in the next part of the lesson._

#### What are you going to do with the information?

T*he assessment information will tell me whether I can move onto the next part of the lesson, which will focus on pupils’ independent practise of the knowledge.*

#### How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?

_The feedback to pupils is going to be almost immediate, as I will give them the answers to the multiple-choice questions. Based on their score, I will direct them towards the next task in the lesson. This may be independent practice, or a reteach by me._

This progression is usually a thought process undertaken when planning and is not typically written down. However, this is a good opportunity to take a few minutes to capture your thoughts and be able to discuss them with your mentor.

$CTA
Select an upcoming assessment opportunity you have planned. This could be from a lesson or the assessment of a unit of work. Consider the purpose of the assessment and answer the questions below.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What are you trying to assess?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Why are you trying to assess this?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What are you going to do with the information?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How are you going to feedback the information to pupils?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
Be prepared to discuss this activity at your next mentor interaction. $CTA

## Assessment tasks linked to the lesson objective

$CTA

Let’s return to the questions posed by Mike Walker when deciding on the purpose of assessment:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What are you trying to assess?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Why are you trying to assess this?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What are you going to do with the information?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How are you going to feed back the information to pupils?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

$CTA

Once these questions have been considered, the only question remaining is **‘how** are you going to assess learning?’.

There are multiple ways you could assess pupil understanding. The ‘how’ might take the form of questioning, a matching activity, a low-stakes quiz, a performance, through interacting with play, or various other methods that might lead to an indication of pupil understanding and highlight gaps in knowledge. The key is to make sure that the ‘how’, in whatever form that takes, is linked to the lesson objective and always supports you to indicate levels of understanding.

Read the recount below from teacher and NQT mentor Mathew Sullivan. Mathew explains how the teacher had planned for the class to write a newspaper report as the assessment task, but that it didn’t create the assessment opportunity the teacher had hoped for.

$I
I observed a KS2 lesson on the Viking invasion at Lindisfarne. The lesson objective was very precise and would have allowed the teacher to make clear inferences about levels of pupil understanding. The objective was to recall the date and key events of the attack on the Lindisfarne monastery. Before the lesson we had spoken as a phase team about the five key pieces of knowledge we wanted pupils to recall from the invasion, and together we had created a presentation that emphasised these.

The beginning of the lesson was very effective, and the teacher even asked members of the class to act out key moments, which really brought the learning to life. The teacher then set the pupils a task to write a newspaper report on the events of the invasion as a method of assessing whether they could recall the key historical facts.

When we sat down after the lesson and looked at what the pupils had learned, the results were somewhat below par. For the majority of the class, the format of the newspaper article had added a layer of complexity to the task that had distracted them from fully achieving the learning objective. Some had written very little, others had not written in the style of a newspaper article and had instead written prose as if they were answering a question, and only a small number had managed to achieve the correct newspaper features, but even they had difficulty ordering the events and deciding whether they should be writing from the perspective of an eye-witness, or the reporter themselves.

When reflecting on why they had selected the newspaper report as an assessment task, the teacher explained that they thought it would be a ‘fun activity’ for the class to complete. However, with it being a full term since the class had completed a unit on newspapers, and no retrieval of key features had taken place in the lesson, the pupils were not able to demonstrate their learning effectively; remembering how to write a newspaper took precedence over recalling the key historical events. It has been my experience that my mentees can be more concerned with the ‘activity’ for the lesson, often asking themselves ‘what are we going to do tomorrow?’. The question that I often tell them to ask themselves instead is ‘what are we going to learn tomorrow?’. It is a subtle distinction, but one that puts the focus squarely onto the learning.

As the objective of the lesson had not being around creating a newspaper article, we discussed different activities that they could have set in order to meet the lesson objective. My mentee decided that a simple recount would have allowed pupils to better demonstrate their learning, and in turn would have provided a clearer indication of their understanding. We did both agree that a newspaper report would be an engaging way to recall the tale of the invasion, but only once the foundational knowledge of the events was assessed as secure, and the features of a newspaper article had been recalled.
$I

This case study highlights the need to carefully consider the assessment tasks you plan for your class. Is the task giving pupils the opportunity to demonstrate their learning towards the lesson objective, and will it give you information about misconceptions or gaps in their knowledge?

Good assessment helps teachers avoid being overly influenced by potentially misleading factors. In this instance, the teacher could have made some inaccurate inferences on pupil learning because the assessment task they set was not an effective method of assessing the target learning. If the task had been to write a recount of the events, the class would most likely have achieved a higher success rate, and the subsequent assessments would have been more accurate.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Select a lesson that you will be teaching this week. How aligned are the lesson objective
and assessment task that you have planned?

Consider these questions:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Is the lesson objective achievable and measurable?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Does the assessment task allow the pupils to demonstrate their learning?

This session will take **approximately 50 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

When lesson planning, it is important to consider how and where you will include assessment opportunities. As highlighted in session 1, your assessment needs to be driven by its purpose and you should be clear about what information you are trying to capture.

This session will focus on:

- How to plan for effective assessment
- Structuring questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions

## Planning for effective assessment

> _“One way to ensure your assessment is effective is to plan for it to be a strong bridge between teaching and learning”_
>
> (Wiliam, 2013)

Carefully planned opportunities for assessment support you to understand your pupils’ needs. This will consequently reduce the amount of time that you spend planning as you will have the information to hand as to where you need to take the learning next.

To demonstrate how you might plan for these assessment opportunities, three key points in a lesson have been selected.

- **Assessing prior knowledge**

Using assessment to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions can mean that you are aware of the levels of understanding across the class before you begin; this may impact on what and how you deliver the learning.

- **Checking that pupils have met the lesson objective**

Anticipating common misconceptions and monitoring pupils as they work can mean that you are able to assess quickly whether a misconception has occurred.

In the following videos, teachers have explained how they maximised some of these moments by carefully planning their assessment to help support their knowledge and understanding of pupils’ needs.

Select the video(s) that you feel are appropriate to your development. You can use the space below to make notes from the videos.

Assessment is an essential part of every lesson, it gives you information about your pupil’s levels of understanding and needs and helps you to know how to respond and where to take the learning next. When I first started teaching, I probably didn’t assess as regularly throughout the lesson as I would now. Assessment would mainly take the form of questioning and then reviewing of pupil work after the lesson. Now it is something that is constantly ongoing, but there are some more natural places to pause during a lesson and plan some intentional assessment opportunities.

A key opportunity for assessment is the beginning of the lesson, and I often use this time to activate some prior learning from either the day before (as a recap) or a week or so ago (as more of a spaced /retrieval practice). Depending on how recently we learnt the topic, I often like to give a partially completed example which the pupils then complete, or a ‘find the error’ example where they find my mistake. I find these really help focus pupil thinking back to the topic knowledge and specifically the process and steps that they need to implement in order to solve a problem. An example from literacy might be something like this (show starter)

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 100%;">
        Correct Mr Sulivan’s grammar mistakes: Walking through the viallage ,
        sarah spotted some yellow ducklings on there own in the pond sarah new
        that they must only be days old and that mabye their mother had flown of
        to find some food for them
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
I often put in common misconceptions or mistakes pupils usually make. Spelling of
the word ‘maybe’ as ‘mabye’, and missing capital letter of proper nouns is really
common.

Another opportunity to plan in some purposeful assessment is to consciously check for misconceptions forming in pupil knowledge. I have been teaching for over 10 years now, so I am more familiar with the types of misconceptions that can happen in each subject, but at the start of my career I found it really valuable to chat with experienced colleagues if I ever felt I wasn’t sure what misconceptions could arise. I like to plan to check for potential misconceptions at two points of the lesson:

<ol>
  <li>As I am about to set pupils to their independent and guided task</li>
  <li>
    And then again during the independent/ guided task – I will move around the
    room and look for misconceptions to correct instantly. This may involve me
    stopping the whole class if I spot a misconception forming in several pupils
    work.
  </li>
</ol>
I don’t do this for every lesson, but where I know there is a good chance of a common
misconception arising, I will give the class a question to answer which contains
the misconception. It is only a quick check, but it helps me get a sense of whether
the class is ready to try the independent work or which pupils would benefit from
more support.

An example of this would be:

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 100%;">
        Which sentence contains the correctly place apostrophe? A – The pupils’
        in the class were ready to learn. B – The pupils in the class were ready
        to learn. C – The pupil’s in the class were ready to learn. How do you
        know?
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
I find it helpful to anticipate potential misconception and be conscious and explicit
about them when I teach. $EndContent $EndAccordion

Assessment is an essential part of every lesson and should be present throughout. Although, the form in which it takes place may vary depending on the stage of pupils learning and the tasks they are completing. Without assessment, lessons cannot address or meet pupils needs.

<h4>Assessing Prior Knowledge</h4>
In a series of lessons, we were looking at the issue of the development gap. The
development gap is the difference in levels of development between the richest and
poorest countries in the world. I wanted to plan in an opportunity to assess whether
pupils could recall the strategies we had previously covered before progressing with
new material.

In order to check pupils deeper understanding, I planned to ask them to recall one strategy and give an example of how this strategy is used. I knew that by asking them to explain how it is being used, I could uncover any misunderstandings they may have about the strategies they recalled.

I planned to check their understanding of this at the beginning of a lesson where the outcome was for pupils to evaluate the success of strategies used to reduce the development gap. I knew that they needed the <strong>prior knowledge</strong> of what different strategies could be used, before they could evaluate their success.

I planned to begin the lesson with a settling task which pupils had to complete as soon as they came into the lesson. This retrieval practice would give me an insight of how much foundational knowledge the pupils could recall from the previous lesson.

I planned to further assess this through question and answer, probing for further information from pupils to gain a deeper understanding of how these strategies help to close the development gap, why they might be used and how successful they have been.

<h4>Checking for misconceptions</h4>I planned to address <strong>
  any misconceptions
</strong> prior to moving on to the next part of the lesson, which was an explanation
of how to evaluate the strategies. Here I planned to show an example answer to demonstrate
the structure of writing required to answer an ‘evaluate’ question. During this explanation,
I planned to assess pupils learning through question and answer to ensure I gave
them enough support before instructing them to complete the task.

During the task, I planned to assess their ability to evaluate the strategies using the correct writing structure through live marking. This is where the teacher moves around the class while the pupils are individually working to assess understanding while pupils are completing a task. I find this form of assessment highly impactful because <strong>misunderstandings can be addressed immediately</strong> through face to face feedback meaning further explanation or challenge can be given to the pupils as they need it. When implementing live marking, I would always check pupils who have demonstrated a weaker understanding first to provide further support if necessary. Planning assessment throughout my lessons in this way has a positive impact on pupil learning as no time is lost through lack of understanding. Any lack of knowledge or understanding that does become apparent can be remedied immediately or planned into following lessons. Because of this, pupils make good progress.

## Planning for effective assessment

Think back to a previous lesson you have taught and answer the following questions in the space provided.

What methods did you use to assess the following? Could you include any of the methods you have heard from fellow teachers into your practice?

- Assessing prior knowledge
- Checking that pupils have met the lesson objective
- Checking for misconceptions and addressing them

## Anticipating misconceptions

When planning for effective assessment, all teachers in the previous section mentioned questioning and the planning of questions to check for pupil understanding at points across the lesson.

Effective questioning was explored in detail in module 3. Below are some of the key features highlighted in that module that should be incorporated into your questioning.

- Avoid self-report questions; ask questions that directly assess pupil understanding of the material being taught
- Check whole class understanding
- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response

Structuring your questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions is a good use of planning time. It will mean that you gather information at key points in the lesson that will help you decide what to do next.

A question type that can be a useful tool for identifying knowledge gaps and misconceptions is a **hinge** question. A hinge question can take the form of an individual question, or multiple-choice question, and they are a check for understanding that allows you to gather assessment information from the whole class simultaneously. The reason they are called a hinge question is that they come at the ‘hinge-point’ of the lesson, this is a point where:

1. you move from one key idea/task/ or learning point to another.
2. understanding the content before the **hinge** is a prerequisite for the next part of the lesson.

The results of the hinge question will determine whether you move on to the next chunk of learning, or work to consolidate, practise or reteach the previous concept further. They are also very useful for helping you to determine whether a pupil has met the lesson objective or not.

$I
Here is an example of a hinge question for a primary science lesson:

Which of the following is true about the moon?

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>It reflects light</li>
  <li>It orbits the earth</li>
  <li>It can’t be seen during the day because there is too much light</li>
  <li>It has no gravity</li>
</ol>
$I

This is an effective hinge question because:

- The question allows the teacher to ascertain a snapshot of all pupils’ levels of understanding.
- It enables the teacher to be highly responsive to pupil needs and make a quick decision about next steps.
- The question would also not take long for the pupils to responds to and would not impact the pace of a lesson.

## Anticipating misconceptions

One useful feature of hinge questions, particularly those structured as a multiple-choice question, is that they can be designed to anticipate and monitor potential misconceptions in pupil understanding.

Let’s look back at the example of the hinge-question on the previous page. If you look carefully at the potential answers, the teacher has designed them to include distracting options that, if selected by pupils, might highlight some of the common misconceptions in pupil thinking around this topic.

$I

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>
    It reflects light{" "}
    <em>(the common misconception being that moon is a source of light)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    It orbits the earth{" "}
    <em>(the common misconception being that the earth orbits the moon)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    It can’t be seen during the day because there is too much light{" "}
    <em>(the common misconception being that moon only comes out at night)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    It has no gravity <em>(this itself being the common misconception)</em>
  </li>
</ol>
$I

Through carefully planning the questions, and aligning the possible answers to a common misconception, the teacher has been able to capture a large amount of useful assessment information from every pupil in the class. This information will enable them to make an informed decision about what steps to take next in teaching and learning.

A hinge point question is designed to be a quick and accurate snapshot of understanding from all pupils. However, you should encourage pupils to share their emerging understanding and points of confusion, so that misconceptions can be addressed. Your follow up questions should be open, such as ‘why did you answer D?’ or ‘Can you explain your thinking further?’.

In the clip below, you will see a primary teacher ask a hinge question around money. From the way he has designed the task and asked the question, it is evident that he has anticipated the class may have a misconception around coin size. In asking this question, and through the subsequent class discussion, he is attempting to address this misconception before independent practice begins.

### Encouraging deeper thinking

A concern sometimes voiced over multiple choice questions is that they are highly effective at assessing some knowledge, but less effective at assessing higher order thinking skills.

An example to counteract this argument can be seen in the following question:

$I
Which of these is the <strong>most immediate</strong> cause of Hitler becoming chancellor?

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li>Nazi violence intimidated many voters and opponents</li>
  <li>Schleicher’s authority collapsed</li>
  <li>
    Hindenburg and Von Papen believed they could control Hitler as chancellor
  </li>
</ol>
(example question taken from ‘Responsive Teaching’ p.g 83) $I

With each answer being a correct cause of Hitler becoming chancellor, the question encourages deeper thinking, taking away a pupil’s immediate desire to identify the correct answer and move on, but instead prompting them to examine their knowledge and identify which answer was the** most immediate** cause.

### Pedagogical subject knowledge

Structuring your questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions will not only give you useful assessment information on your pupils’ knowledge and understanding, but it can be a useful barometer as to your own level of understanding of concept.

The ease with which you can anticipate a misconception is directly related to how familiar you are with the subject matter. Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts should be an ongoing exercise for you in your early teaching career.

This session will take **approximately 45 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

It is important to check for understanding throughout your lesson and monitor for the occurrence of misconceptions. If you do spot a mistake, how best should this be corrected?

This session will focus on:

- Monitoring pupils independent practice for the development of misconceptions
- Deciding when is best to give feedback, and what form that will take.

## Monitoring pupils’ work for misconceptions

As mentioned at the end of session 2, ensuring that you have excellent subject knowledge will mean that you are better equipped when considering where misconceptions in pupil thinking and understanding may occur.

Understanding a potential common misconception in a subject will inform your planning, how you deliver your explanations, and the scaffolds you will provide. It will also support the assessment opportunities you include and dictate where they will be most needed in the lesson. You will use those opportunities to check understanding and assess whether a misconception has occurred.

Session 2 explored the structuring of hinge questions to anticipate and identify misconceptions, but a further key opportunity to spot a pupil with a misconception is during independent practice.

## Monitoring Independent Practice

Despite careful planning and sequencing of knowledge, and in spite of checking for understanding at key points in the lesson, pupils can still develop misconceptions. It is often during independent practice that these come to light, and you discover there has been some misunderstanding earlier in the lesson. It is therefore essential that you monitor independent practice and act where appropriate.

A good strategy to help you monitor independent practice is to circulate around the class during the session.

Some teachers move around the classroom checking to make sure pupils are ‘on track’. However, this can often mean they are focusing on completion of work, as opposed to mastery of skills.

When circulating effectively, you will notice two things:

- **Examples** **of success** (these could be showcased to the class)
- **Examples of specific mistakes/errors** (these should be considered before the lesson)

The amount of assessment data you could collect by circulating can be overwhelming. You may notice layout issues, poor handwriting, spelling mistakes and more, so it is important to plan to look for specific data and consider a way to track this data that will allow you to refer to it after the lesson.

One straightforward method of tracking data during the independent practice is by printing out the class register and completing the following steps:

- Prior to the lesson, consider what it is you are wanting to monitor during the practice
- Create a simple code that can signal pupil understanding.

$I
An example of this tracker might be as follows:

<strong>Potential error</strong>

Codes:

<ol>
  <li>Pupil did not invert fraction before beginning calculation</li>
  <li>Pupil did not express answer as a mixed number fraction</li>
</ol>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 102.994%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 50%;">Pupil Name:</th>
      <th style="width: 50%;">Code: 1 or 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;">Joe Bloggs</td>
      <td style="width: 50%;">1 &amp; 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 50%;">Jane Bloggs</td>
      <td style="width: 50%;">1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Monitoring work and acting on information will be the focus of your next observation and mentor interaction. You may wish to discuss this activity with your mentor at your next meeting to see whether they agree with your identified potential errors.

## When should you give feedback?

When monitoring pupil work across the lesson, you are constantly making decisions around what to feedback to individuals, and what is necessary to address with the whole class. Research indicates that providing feedback is one of the most effective – and cost effective – ways of improving pupil learning. But what should the feedback look like, and when should you give it?

A recent synthesis of information by the [Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/feedback/#closeSignup) (EEF) concluded that, on average, the provision of high-quality feedback led to an improvement of **eight additional** **months** of progress over the course of a year. However, providing effective feedback can be challenging, and the research also highlighted that when feedback is not given well it can have a negative impact on pupil progress.

$I

<h3>When should you give feedback?</h3>
Research studies into feedback do make a distinction between a ‘mistake’ and an ‘error’.

<strong>Mistake</strong> – something a student can do, and does normally do correctly,
but has not on this occasion.

<strong>Error</strong> - which occurs when answering something that a student has
not mastered or has misunderstood.
<p style="text-align: right;">(EEF – A Marked Improvement? p.g 12)</p>
$I

If a pupil makes a mistake, how much feedback is it worth giving in order to correct the mistake? The EEF ‘[A Marked Improvement](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Presentations/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf)? (2016)’ report concludes that it should be marked as incorrect, but that the correct answer should not be provided. The rationale for this is that, if a pupil is given the correct answer, it means they are no longer required to think about the mistakes they have made, and as a result are likely to repeat the mistake again.

Conversely, if a pupil has made an error and therefore has a potential misconception, the report recommends that it is most effective to remind the pupil of a related rule or offer a hint towards a correct answer. If the error was treated the same as a mistake, by simply marking it incorrect, a pupil would not have the knowledge to work out what they have done wrong.

## When should you give feedback?

Knowing when to give feedback, and what type of feedback will be most effective, can be challenging, particularly as research has identified that feedback can sometimes have a negative impact on pupil progress.

Whilst monitoring your pupils you may notice errors occurring. When this happens, there are four different ways that you could correct the error in your pupils’ thinking:

- Immediate correction of the individual who has made the error
- Immediate class correction
- Through detailed marking
- Addressing the error through planning for the next lesson

As a teacher you will use the information from your assessments to inform the decisions you make. You may notice that there is a common error occurring, and it is therefore appropriate to stop the whole class to ensure that the misconception does not become ingrained. It can sometimes feel daunting to stop the class during independent practice, but by doing so, it will save you time when marking pupil work as you will not need to write the same comment repeatedly. It will also mean you will not need to plan to undo new errors in thinking in subsequent lessons.

### Assessment

6.1 Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.

6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.

6.3 Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

6.4 To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.

_6a. Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps)._

In defining feedback, and this does sound obvious, but something has to happen first. Like the way bats or whales tend to use sound to listen to the echoes: sonic use. So, feedback is a reaction, it's a consequence of the performance.

I think there are two types basically, that's useful and, probably, useless. In terms of educational feedback, the purpose is generally to provide information that consolidates or improves performance

There are numerous forms of feedback - oral feedback, such as about a piece of work, observation of a task or response to a question acknowledgment, the ticking of a page to say that the work is actually being looked at and then we use things like grades or marks, and then written feedback.

There's also a physical feedback, the learners pick up on the nods and the winks and the applause and their facial expressions. The method will of course depend on the purpose and the context:

<ul>
  <li>What are you trying to achieve?</li>
  <li>Why?</li>
  <li>So how is this best achieved?</li>
</ul>
However, feedback can have three effects on receivers, they can be:
<ul>
  <li>positive</li>
  <li>negative, or indeed it can be</li>
  <li>neutral</li>
</ul>
To have a positive effect, learners need to know where they are in their learning
- what are the next steps, or possible steps, and some indication of how to get there?
In other words, it works best if it is focused on confirming what is being done.
Is it right or clearly indicates what needs to be done, with some indication of what
can be achieved, where the learner needs to go next? This raises questions about
the method and style of feedback. It's often seen as desirable to give praising feedback,
but be cautious, it's likely to be well received and often engender motivation when
it's genuine, but it's sometimes difficult to maintain. $EndContent $EndAccordion

When sharing feedback with pupils, you need to consider carefully what it is you are wanting the pupil to change, and then be specific in what you ask them to do. This applies to individual and class written or verbal feedback. As highlighted by Mike, there is often lots of feedback that you could give to a pupil. However, skilled teachers identify what feedback will have the biggest impact and then share it with pupils in an effective way.

John Hattie, author of ‘Visible Learning’, believed that there are four levels of change possible from a piece of feedback (either written or verbal). What you want pupils to change will dictate what level of feedback you give. The levels range from asking them to make changes to the task itself, to changing a pupil’s view on their own learning.

The four levels are:

- Task: How can the task be completed or improved.
- Process: How can I do better at tasks like this?
- Self-Regulation: How can I manage myself to be a better learner?
- Self-Evaluation: How good am I?

(Hattie and Timperley, 2007)

| **Task**            | **Task ** _e.g. rewrite your answer to question 3 removing the brackets at step 2._ This type of feedback is directive and helps to improve the current task. However, its effects are limited as pupils are unlikely to be able to transfer this correction to other tasks.                       |
| **Process**         | **Process ** _e.g. always underline key words in the question, then write a plan linked to them. _ This level of feedback helps pupils to understand underlying features of success in the subject and supports them to transfer their skills.                                                     |
| **Self-regulation** | **Self-regulation ** _e.g. Which strategies that you used today worked well? Why?_ This is about helping pupils to understand more about how they learn by helping them to self-monitor, recognise how well they are doing, and to think about how they can respond to improve their own learning. |
| **Self-evaluation** | **Self-evaluation ** _e.g. You are great at maths._ Pupils like praise and it may help to motivate, but praise based on the pupil has little effect on learning, as it offers no useful information about how to improve.                                                                          |

Research into the use of these targeted levels of feedback has concluded that consistent feedback of any one type is insufficient. If feedback is too task-focused, pupils will have difficulty transferring it to other concepts. If it is too general, they may have difficulty applying it to specific tasks.

The most powerful approach therefore is to offer **balanced feedback** that links types – task, process and self-regulation.

The examples below show how the balance of levels could be shared with an individual in either verbal or written form.

$I

<h4>Example 1:</h4>"<em>
  Correct question 3 – check the steps again to see where you went wrong.
</em> <strong>What will you do differently tomorrow?</strong>"

This piece of feedback, given as written or verbal, is broken down into <em>task feedback</em> and <strong>self-regulation</strong>.

<h4>Example 2:</h4>L<em>
  ook back at your checklist for creating a bar chart.
</em> <strong>You have missed out a crucial step – can you identify and change it on the graph?</strong>

This piece of feedback can be broken down into <em>task</em> and <strong>process</strong>.

<h4>Example 3:</h4>
<em>One of the animals you ticked doesn’t live in a cold place.</em> <strong>How can you use our display to help you remember which animals live in the cold?</strong>

This piece of feedback can be broken down into <em>task</em> and <strong>self-regulation</strong>.
$I

When you are deciding what feedback to give a pupil, consider what you want them to change, then help them to make that change by giving them feedback that targets that level(s). Ensure that your feedback is accurate and clear and provides specific guidance on how to improve.

Once you have decided _**what**_ you want them to change (e.g. something to do with the task), you then have a decision to make about _**how**_ you will share that feedback.

In session 1, Mike Walker explained that there were four questions you should ask yourself when deciding on the purpose and design of your assessment. The final question was:

- **How** are you going to feed back the information to pupils?

When giving feedback, you want pupils to be able to access it and, crucially, be able to act on it. The next sections are going to look at additional ways to address the ‘how’ you could feed back information about learning to your pupils.

It's worth spending the little bit of time considering written feedback, this is the area that attracts quite a lot of attention, especially with regards to things like teacher workload. There's evidence that written comments are more effective in moving pupils forward than say for example using marks or grades. However, whilst high marks may motivate some pupils, low marks may well have the opposite effect on other pupils.

There's also evidence that giving marks and comments doesn't necessarily work. Pupils read the mark or grade and not actually the comments, but written feedback is not always effective. Here we need to consider the quality of the feedback. Does it actually help or hinder? Does it clarify or confuse? Is it worth the time and is it worth the effort? And is the feedback appropriate? I've seen one side of A4 of teachers’ comments given back to infants who can't actually read. So this raises the question: who is the feedback for? Is it really having a positive impact on the learner or is it to simply to comply with a marking policy or set of expectations about teacher behaviour? Feedback is an effective basic human interaction, but in a teaching and learning environment we don't ask quite often enough about whether the feedback is actually making a difference and how do we know it's making a difference?

Marking is something that is generally referred to in feedback but the impact of marking has been of particular interest in terms of teacher workload and the DfE teacher workload challenge which was in 2014 found that marking was one of three top causes of teacher mark load. In fact 53% of about 47,000 people thought that whilst marking pupils work is necessary and productive it's frequency in depth is often burdensome. Much of this was associated with what has been described as deep marking, or triple marking. That means several iterations of comments between the teacher and pupil using different pens so this transaction goes backwards and forwards, but there's no evidence that this is actually effective but yet the practice, the use of this, is very widespread. The DfE report reducing marking, use of workload around marking, met three I think very useful suggestions that marking should be:

<ul>
  <li>meaningful</li>
  <li>motivational</li>
  <li>manageable</li>
</ul>
There's also a report from a group of 16 schools in Wigan, the ‘Wow’ schools, ‘With
Others We Succeed’, who tried a variety of approaches to marking pupils work in order
to evaluate the impact on pupils, teachers and indeed parents. Was it meaningful?
Was it motivational and was it manageable? The trial approaches including things
like just stopping marking to see if actually made any difference and indeed it did
make a difference, but it led to changes in classroom practice like structuring lessons
to allow time for speaking to pupils, a different mode of feedback. There were some
significant gains in terms of reduced workload and an increase in pupil satisfaction.
Now this is not to say that written feedback is wrong. Teachers need a repertoire
of feedback techniques, but it is important that schools and teachers should evaluate
their practice to see what actually works and, by that, I mean what actually impacts
on teaching and learning. $EndContent $EndAccordion

Providing feedback through marking pupil work is a core task for teachers. A written response is a clear method of providing feedback, and a method of supporting progress and attainment. However, a [2016 report by the Independent Teacher Workload Review Group](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/511256/Eliminating-unnecessary-workload-around-marking.pdf) noted that written marking was a key component of large teacher workloads, and recommended that marking should be driven by professional judgement and be “meaningful, manageable and motivating” (p.g. 9).

**Meaningful:** marking varies by age group, subject, and what works best for the pupil and teacher in relation to any piece of work. Teachers are encouraged to adjust their approach as necessary and trusted to incorporate the outcomes into subsequent planning and teaching.

**Manageable:** marking practice is proportionate and considers the frequency and complexity of written feedback, as well as the cost and time-effectiveness of marking in relation to the overall workload of teachers. This is written into any assessment policy.

**Motivating:** Marking should help to motivate pupils to progress. This does not mean always writing in-depth comments or being universally positive: sometimes short, challenging comments or oral feedback are more effective. If the teacher is doing more work than their pupils, this can become a disincentive for pupils to accept challenges and take responsibility for improving their work.

Further to this, the EEF report ‘[A Marked Improvement](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/evidence-reviews/written-marking/)’ highlighted some key research findings about how to make written feedback more effective for pupils:

- Awarding grades for every piece of work may reduce the impact of marking, particularly if pupils become preoccupied with grades at the expense of a consideration of teachers’ formative comments
- The use of targets to make marking as specific and actionable as possible is likely to increase pupil progress
- Pupils are unlikely to benefit from marking unless some time is set aside to enable pupils to consider and respond to marking
- Some forms of marking, including acknowledgement marking (e.g. ticks or VF to indicate verbal feedback), are unlikely to enhance pupil progress. A mantra might be that schools should mark less in terms of the number of pieces of work marked but mark better.

## 2. Group verbal feedback

It is important to highlight that written marking is only one type of feedback. Verbal feedback is one of the most commonly used forms of classroom feedback. It can be provided on written work in the form of re-teaching misunderstandings or intervening and guiding pupils through the lesson. Using verbal feedback can mean you can address misconceptions and give immediate correction in-lesson.

In many instances, verbal feedback will be given to individuals. You have seen examples of how to do this effectively when responding to questions and answers in module 3, or when monitoring independent work and balancing the levels of feedback you should give in module 4. However, giving group verbal feedback is also highly effective. Below is one example of how it can be done.

**Group verbal feedback** is about giving targeted verbal feedback towards a group of pupils or whole class. The teacher would read through a set of books and take notes on how the whole class have responded. Then, in the next lesson, the teacher responds to the most frequent issues that came up by giving general feedback to the class or group.

The teacher may select one pupil who has done well as a model of what they are looking for. Alternatively, they could select a pupil’s work that could be a model for responding to the feedback. Either method would support pupils to build a mental model of how to act on the feedback.

$I
A further method of using group feedback would be to provide immediate correction by stopping the whole class (or group) to address a common misconception you have seen arising.

There are three ways that giving group feedback can be done:

$I

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Reteaching:</strong> allows you to challenge misconceptions or
    knowledge gaps.
  </li>
</ol>
For example: In maths, pupils are consistently forgetting to complete the final step
of solving a word problem (which is to re-read the problem and answer the question).
Initial teaching can be repeated here with the use of fresh examples and reminders
of the steps.
<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <strong>Revisiting models of work:</strong> allows pupils to compare their
    work to a successful model and improve their work against it.
  </li>
</ol>
For example: Helping pupils identify missing features of a writing genre.  Revising
models allows pupils to improve their work and understand what success looks like.
<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <strong>Revising process:</strong> allows pupils to understand the thought
    process and choices which help to create good work.
  </li>
</ol>
For example: Taking a weak answer (or creating one yourself) and modelling rewriting
or correcting it on the board. $I

We know that feedback is important and has a direct impact on progress. So, we need to be delivering that feedback in a constructive way. It's also really important to recognise that writing books isn't the only form of feedback and actually writing in every single book can become an onerous task and have a disproportionate impact on your workload.

If the purpose of feedback is to recognise strengths, correct misconceptions, and keep pupils motivated, using group verbal feedback in the lessons having marked books can be really impactful. To prepare for this, when looking through books you need to become really familiar with a level of understanding in the class. Then you can use that knowledge to feed back to the whole group in a subsequent lesson and immediately see the impact that feedback can have on the learning. You could also stop to offer group verbal feedback just in the middle of a lesson so you're not responding to what you've seen in the books when you've looked at them, but you're responding to the work that's happening there and then. And again pupils will be able to respond to that guidance straight away.

## 3. Symbol Marking

A way of making our marking more concise and easier to understand is by using symbols or abbreviations to indicate a statement.

Coded banks of statements can be created by an individual teacher or with colleagues across the school. In recent years, school marking policies often include a ‘marking code’. The symbols can be as detailed as you would like and can easily be made subject-specific. You can see an example of this in the table below. Please note that this is one example, rather than a recommended set of codes.

If using symbol marking, it is important that they are shared and that you know that your pupils understand the codes. Displaying them in the classroom and in pupil books is highly effective.

|     |                           |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| AP  | Achievement Point         |
| BP  | Behaviour Point           |
| OA  | Objective Achieved        |
| PA  | Objective partly achieved |
| NA  | Objective not achieved    |
| Sp  | Spelling mistake          |
| //  | New paragraph needed      |
| WND | Word not needed           |
| GD  | Good description          |
| ^   | Missing word              |
| P   | Punctuation needed        |

When my school introduced the symbol marking code, the department head had made sure that the codes were simple to understand, really clear with what they were referring to, and he directed us to use them often to get the pupils used to them. The codes were introduced across the department and this therefore ensured consistency of use, which enabled both teachers and pupils to begin to understand them quicker.

A few examples of our codes are: P: point, Ev: evidence, Ex: explanation.

When we introduced the codes, it was important to model their use for the pupils and we marked a series of modelled answers on the board together. I used the “I do, we do, you do” approach and I was able to show my pupils how they should expect to see them presented in their work and what this meant they needed to do as an action.

On a practitioner level, I find the marking code effective as it helps me to provide meaningful feedback to my pupils. I find they understand the code quickly and can begin to action feedback immediately. It has also had a positive impact on my workload as it is quicker to denote where success and areas for improvement are by using the symbols, rather than having to write lengthy prose. This saves me time and I can therefore invest that time into planning improvement tasks or planning for their next lesson where the pupils will actually have the opportunity to incorporate those improvements. I also find that when we are looking at work as a department, the marking code enables standardisation. I use the same codes as all the other teachers, and it makes cross referencing across the department quick and effective. We are able to look at a students work, see where the teacher has identified where they think a criteria has or has not been met and then we can check through it. Alternatively, during blind standardisation (when we all have clean copies of the same script) we can then discuss it and if there is disagreement about the mark the question should be awarded, that’s when we can query why one person thinks there is sufficient evidence or not by using the symbols to zoom in on those areas in question.

My use of the marking code isn’t only kept for marking after the lesson, I also use it during my lessons to support with live marking. I circulate the room and use the marking codes to assess pieces of work and provide areas for improvement instantly. The pupils can then respond immediately, and I can support them with that where necessary.

I find that the pupils have responded well to the codes, it has empowered and encouraged them to take responsibility for their own learning as well as providing them with a tool that can reassure them as they write their answers. For example, they can abbreviate PEE in the margin as they write.

The codes have also supported my classes to effectively self/peer assess as pupils are then able to plan, review and assess their own progress. This is powerful for when completing tasks and also in preparation for examinations. I will not be in the exam with them, so the symbols help them to self-mark and correct where necessary, supporting them to understand and internalise what a good answer looks like.

Yellow box highlighting is used regularly to highlight a particular focus that needs addressing. The yellow box is explained to the pupils at the beginning of the academic year. In year 2 this is used consistently when marking an end of unit assessment in English (the final writing piece of the genre taught eg a poem, character description, a letter, retelling of a story etc)

The yellow box is modelled by the teacher around a short piece of writing eg a sentence or two that has a lot of mistakes then need to be corrected. The teacher models reading the piece of writing together with the class – not pausing where full stops need to be inserted, reading words as they are written (phonics) that sound incorrect, letters written back to front etc..

The teacher then models to the class how to spot the mistakes but also encouraging ideas for the pupils as they read along and spot other mistakes. The teacher models how to correct and edit along with pupils editing too. The teacher also models the correct use of grammar and questions pupils on this as the text is read out loud.

Once the areas to improve have been identified and the discussion has taken place about the ideas to edit, the whole of the section highlighted in yellow is rewritten to show the completed version of editing.

To reinforce, in key stage one this would be a short sentence (or two for year 2).

The work is always remarked (alongside the pupils) to ensure the pupils see this has been acknowledged and to ensure they understand the purpose of editing and feeling pride in their finished pieces. Over time pupils are then able to self correct and self improve after reading through a yellow box that is highlighted. For some pupils, support may still be required to address key areas to improve eg grammar – past / present tense or spelling of words that have already been taught within the spelling programme used.

## Summary

### Responding to feedback

This session will take **approximately 35 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

How can we make feedback purposeful and manageable?

This session will focus on:

- Understanding what effective peer and self-assessment looks like.
- Improving pupils’ metacognitive strategies to support them to be more independent learners.

## Effective peer and self-assessment

Peer and self-assessment are powerful forms of feedback when harnessed correctly. However, you cannot expect pupils to master the art of effective peer and self-assessment without first understanding how to meaningfully respond to feedback themselves, and second, having a clear mental model of what effective peer and self-assessment looks like.

When done well, peer and self-assessment can:

- Give pupils the opportunity to think carefully about their own learning and that of their peers
- Reduce marking load for the teacher
- Allow pupils to develop their mental model of what success looks like in a task and support them to develop transferrable knowledge
- Support self-regulation and independence.

When done poorly however, it can lead to:

- Poor progress for pupils
- A waste of lesson time
- Pupils focusing on the wrong learning points
- Pupils developing a poor mental model of effective feedback
- The development of misconceptions.

During the course of a lesson, or sequence of lessons, you build up a picture of your students learning by using assessments to take multiple inadequate glances through a variety of lenses - moment by moment quizzes, topic questions and so on and by doing so you can increase your confidence in knowing how your students are doing. In a similar way both self-assessment and peer assessment can help your students increase their confidence in how they're doing. And just as you are learning to develop the skills of teacher assessment, so your students need to learn the skills of self and peer assessment. Self and peer assessments are not just valuable tools for producing information. The very act of thinking hard about your own work or someone else's work can be powerful learning events in and of themselves for the person doing the thinking. Done poorly, however, these approaches take up too much classroom time and can lead to students focusing on the wrong drivers of success. Effective self-assessment is a process in which a student thinks independently about their own work and how it could be improved. For it to be useful, the process should be modelled and scaffolded deliberately for your students as it's often unfamiliar and challenging and the steps involved need to be transparent and understood by everyone in your classroom.

There are four things that help most teachers use self-assessment effectively:

<ol>
  <li>
    Firstly, provide students with clear and understandable examples of what you
    want them to learn - modelling the destination in this way can be incredibly
    powerful in knowing where they're going on the journey
  </li>
  <li>
    Secondly share specific and understandable success criteria that help your
    students know how they're doing along the way
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan opportunities for your students to use those success criteria
    independently to identify both their own successes and the things that they
    need to improve, and finally,
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan opportunities for your students to work independently to make the
    identified improvements and I can't stress that last point enough. The most
    important thing about feedback is what a student does with it
  </li>
</ol>
Effective peer assessment involves students thinking about someone else's piece of
work and how it could be improved. Peer assessment can be a powerful learning tool
and it's not actually about students marking each other's work, as sometimes it's
thought, and, structured well, it can have a positive impact both for the student
receiving the peer assessment feedback as well as for the student giving it. Often
those students who engage in effective peer assessment tasks become much more aware
of how to improve their own work by virtue of trying to improve others.

Peer assessment engages your students in taking on the role of what Dylan William has called ‘learning resources for their peers’ and just as with self-assessment you'll need to provide students with exemplars and success criteria as well as planned opportunities to identify successes and areas for improvement and crucially planned opportunities to act on this information.

Both peer assessment and self-assessment require students to self-regulate effectively. They need to be able to think about the process of their own learning explicitly and to manage it. But to do so requires motivation, a willingness on the part of the student. Your students need to be motivated to engage in something that is inherently difficult so helping them understand not just what they're learning, but also how they learn effectively, can be instrumental in generating the motivation to put in the effort needed to learn.

As an Early Years teacher I find assessment checkpoints (sometimes known as mini plenaries) throughout a period of learning is an effective way to support self-assessment. After a whole class input to a text or piece of writing, the children in Reception move on to tasks which are to be completed independently or supported by the teacher or teaching assistant. With half the class working independently, it gives a good opportunity to use assessment checkpoints to refocus the children, to assess their understanding of the task, and to remind the children of expectations. Within this time, I ask for the attention of all children and explain (so everyone can hear) what I like about individual children’s work and asking them to look at their own work and see if they have similar or think about how they could but this ‘positive’ into their own work. The modelling of what I'm thinking, and what I think is successful, helps them to self-assess whether they recognise it in their own work.

Within continuous provision, self-assessment is set up in areas such as the construction or glue area. Adults enhance the learning in these areas by supplying a task that ‘could be’ completed if the children need this structured support, rather than child-initiated work. An example of this task is a ‘child planning sheet’. These are placed in various areas across the continuous provision and they encourage children to draw what they want to make, they then go away and create their models, and move on to complete the sheet with a ‘How to make it better next time?’ Although this takes time for young children to be able to self-assess their own work, a child who is assessed as ‘Exceeding’ , is expected to be able to ‘carry out activities and state what they might change if they were to repeat them’.

To support the development of peer-assessment, each week we have a whole class writing lesson which includes some peer-marking. I place a large copy of a child’s work onto the whiteboard/visualiser and question children ‘What do you like about this work?’ When the children become familiar with what I’m looking for and what is in ‘good’ writing they are able to hold dialogues about their peers work at the age of four or five. This is then marked with the children as it would be in books. For example, a child might state that they can see a capital letter and a full stop. I would then mark the work with a star (\*) and the symbol ‘C’ for capital letters and a ‘.’ (full stop). Moving on to ‘something to improve’ gives the children the opportunity to support each other with areas to address such as ‘descenders not hanging under the line’, ‘ascenders not touching the top of the line’ etc This would be highlighted in yellow and then modelled by me below on how this is to be completed correctly. The same practice is applied in individual textbooks. However, children are given time to apply their changes next to the highlighted modelling.

Self and peer assessment of writing is something I always plan for at the end of a unit of work. This has had a positive impact on pupil outcomes.

The process of developing the right culture and modelling the process of assessing another’s work is something that I have built up slowly over the course of the year making sure that, from the outset, the pupils understood assessment of their own, or their peers work, was to pinpoint areas to improve and to celebrate successes. I didn’t want the pupils to think that helping someone with their work was always a case of looking for ‘mistakes’. Therefore, I always begin peer or self-assessment by asking pupils to identify strengths in the work. Identifying and sharing what their peers did well encouraged pupils to look for similar things in their own work. This was especially effective for those who found it tricky to identify their own successes.

After identifying areas of success, the pupils are then asked to identify one place in their work that could be improved. One really powerful way I have found to do this this effectively is to get a pupil to read aloud someone else’s work back to them, following all punctuation and reading each word as it is written. Hearing what your own work sounds like, more often than not, makes pupils realise where things may not quite flow well, sound repetitive or, because of the way it has been punctuated doesn’t make sense. I set this up initially by modelling this with the whole class. I used a piece of writing I put together myself, and had a volunteer to read the work aloud exactly as written. Everyone in the class was given the opportunity to offer comments and opinions; firstly on one thing they found really effective, and then one thing they thought could be improved. As pupils offered feedback, I offered suggestions as to how responses could be re-worded or developed to be effective. The pupils then followed this model.

After receiving feedback from their peers or an adult, the pupils used a coloured pencil to make changes to their writing so any improvements could be clearly seen. Sometimes pupils ask to re-draft whole paragraphs as well as changing the odd piece of vocabulary or punctuation.

When planning self and peer assessment, I always start with the ‘why’. For it to be successful, the pupils need to see the purpose in doing it. I like to explain the benefits; such as ‘you can identify mistakes and self-correct', ‘your peer can provide alternative viewpoints or suggestions to develop your work’, they can be a ‘friendly second eye’ catching any errors that you may have made.

In my classroom, self-assessment can range from retrieval quiz marking, to peer debate assessment, to feeding back on written work. Different practitioners use different assessment tools such as ‘Want Went Well’ and ‘Even Better If’ or ‘2 stars and a wish’ etc. My advice would be to select one approach to self-assessment initially, and be consistent with it, measuring the impact as you do.

When pupils have an opportunity to peer assess work, I always ensure that feedback is positive, developmental and non-threatening, and I stress that it should be friendly, informative and specific. My class initially gave feedback to each other that was very simplistic, such as ‘even better if: you write more’ or ‘even better if: you complete it’. To ensure feedback was useful, I provided pupils with a clear mark scheme or success criteria, and ensured that the improvement points reflected that mark scheme. To achieve this, it took a lot of modelling from me. Each time I modelled giving feedback, I made my improvement areas link back to the success criteria by giving an example such as ‘EBI: you used specific evidence and a range of evidence’
A specific example of self and peer assessment in action is from a GCSE class where we completed an assessment (key task). Whilst it is a teacher assessed piece of work, I get them to self-assess it first. This empowers them to be able to assess their own work and identify for themselves their improvements, which they will have to do in examinations – they need to be able to look back over their work and determine if they have met the criteria and where they need to amend or add in additional knowledge. At the end of the assessment, I asked them to mark their answers using codes. They did this in green pen and identified for themselves where the improvements needed to be made. This is useful as well because when I then mark their work, it lets me know if they have interpreted the success criteria correctly and that they understand the components of the question and the knowledge that they have applied. Instead of having to infer why they may have got an aspect wrong, it helps me to really zoom in on their understanding – is it that they knew for themselves they had not been successful in that area (“my evidence was inaccurate, it should have been….”) or whether they didn’t pick up on that being an error and marked it correctly (which means they have a misconception that I need to re-teach them). I then give them their responses back so that they can action the areas that we have agreed need to be improved.

I used peer assessment when asking pupils to assess practice examination questions. When doing this, I made sure I had a clear mark scheme available to them that was pupil friendly and accessible. This enabled pupils to clearly identify where marks were awarded and understand the difference between the levels, so that they could look at how to progress.

When setting this up in the classroom, I saw it as an evolutionary approach that I would have to build on overtime to ensure pupil understanding, avoid working memory overload, and check that the system was being applied correctly. I clearly modelled how to give the feedback and spoke aloud about my thought process at each step. This helps me to constantly reinforce my expectations. For the pupils first attempt, I also scaffolded their feedback using and corrected their responses where appropriate. My pupils soon started to identify ‘this is where I need to improve, this is what I need to improve, this is how I need to improve it’.

### Metacognition and Self-Assessment

You have been introduced to the concept of metacognition in module 2 and built on this in module 3 through the strategy of ‘thinking aloud’. Alongside supporting pupils to move new learning into the long-term memory, developing metacognitive strategies will also improve their independence and ability to self-assess and think critically about their own learning.

Imagine a group of pupils that were independent enough to effectively self-assess by evaluating their knowledge, identifying gaps in their learning, determining the effectiveness of their work and planning to make the relevant changes in the future. Metacognitive strategies support pupils to be able to do this by focusing on developing their ability to** plan, monitor and evaluate** their own learning. Pupils will effectively be self-assessing their progress as they move through the task, as well as after the fact.

### How can you teach pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate learning?

The first step is to ensure that pupils have secure subject knowledge in the area in which they are applying the metacognitive strategy. Without knowledge, pupils will not be able to apply the strategies they are being taught. Instead, they will still be trying to understand and learn the concept, rather than reflecting effectively on how well they have learnt it and what they need to do next.

The next step is to know that development of metacognitive strategies requires explicit teaching and modelling in order to train pupils’ thinking.

The EEF report into metacognition and self-regulation highlights that you should ask pupils questions that focus their thinking on how they could plan, monitor and evaluate their learning. The teacher should also explicitly model this thinking in order to develop it in their pupils.

---

#### Plan

Encourage pupils to think about the goal of their learning and how they will approach the task.

_How will I approach the problem? Which strategies will I use? How do I manage my resources?_

#### Monitor

Emphasising the need for pupils to assess the progress they are making as they go.

_What is working? What isn't working? Why am I finding this challenging?_

#### Evaluate

Appraising the effectiveness of their plan.

_How did I do?_

---

The EEF have developed seven practical recommendations that support the teaching and development of metacognition in pupils. Two of these strategies have been covered in this ECF programme. Take five minutes to [review the remaining five](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/Summary_of_recommendations_poster.pdf).

## Effective self and peer assessment

One of the seven recommendations for teaching metacognitive strategies is to encourage pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning.

Consider the scenario below. Then, after each verbalised thought in the table, identify whether it would support a pupils’ ability to better <strong>plan, monitor or evaluate </strong>their own learning.

Scenario:

You have asked your pupils to draw or paint a self-portrait. Knowing that modelling the task will give pupils a clear idea of what success in the task looks like, you draw your own self-portrait in front of the class. Knowing also that an effective way to develop metacognitive strategies and self-regulation in your pupils is to verbalise your thinking, you talk aloud through your model, articulating why you have made the choices that you have.

This session will take **approximately 30 minutes** to complete.

## Session Overview

As a teacher, you draw your conclusions about pupil learning from their pattern of performance from a number of assessments over time. A summative assessment is a snapshot in time in pupil learning, and it is important to recognise what they can and can’t tell you about pupil understanding.

This session will focus on:

- The importance and challenges of summative data
- Identifying patterns of performance

Uses and limitations of summative assessment

### A snapshot in time

As highlighted in the video above, summative assessments offer a “snapshot in time” of pupil performance. They test a cross section of pupil knowledge of the curriculum and allow performance to be recorded as a grade descriptor (e.g. ‘Emerging’ or 8). These grades are useful for establishing a shared understanding about pupil performance in comparison to others.

Earlier in the module the difference between ‘learning’ and ‘performance’ was referenced. How a pupil performs in a test is not necessarily a direct reflection of their learning. External factors could have a negative impact on performance. Similarly, the questions in the test could play to the strengths of the pupil and their performance could be better than their pattern so far. It is therefore important to be aware of the limitations of summative assessments and be mindful about what inferences you can make from the data. You may hear a pupil who performs poorly in a summative test exclaim “I am no good at this subject!”, but when you review their performance patterns over time, it might be that their understanding is not secure in a few subject areas, but their overall subject knowledge is good. Paying attention to a pupil’s general patterns of performance over time will give you a better judgement overall.

### Avoiding misleading factors

There are two types of summative tests:

- the ‘difficulty model’ where the questions get harder as the test goes on,
- the ‘quality model’ which are generally essays or performance pieces.

For summative tests to produce any shared meaning, they must consist of standard tasks. Both models must be completed in controlled conditions, in order for them to be a reliable indicator of performance. Using externally validated materials which have been nationally standardised also allows you to create a shared meaning of how your pupils are performing compared to the national picture.

However, the validity of the judgements that can be made are more difficult with assessments that follow the quality model. This is simply down to the fact that quality model assessments usually have a mark scheme based on descriptors (rubrics). Markers may interpret the descriptors differently within an essay style question, and the same question may receive a different grading from separate markers.

A way to negate this interpretation issue, and avoid any misleading factors that could impact on accurate assessments, is to moderate teacher judgments in teams. Moderation requires all teachers to review the same essay question or performance piece and discuss what judgment they would give and why. This is a task that needs to be repeated often in order to improve judgments overall. Over time, it will improve the reliability of the marks awarded by individual teachers and ensure better consistency across teams.

## Analysing Data

When analysing your summative data, you will be looking for patterns in performance in classes, across topics, and with individual pupils. There may be topics where there is a pattern of pupils generally scoring consistently low in certain areas – you would therefore know that those pupils would benefit from the content being retaught. You will also be looking for pupils that require further targeting as a method of improving their performance. As referenced in the video above, summative assessment data can have a higher ‘perceived importance’ due to the reporting of it. However, it is important to remember that the grade boundaries are ‘lines in the sand’ and it is vital that you look beyond them and not simply target those that are in the lower boundaries. It is also useful to only record data when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes and not be attempting to capture summative ‘snapshots’ of data when formative assessments would be a more beneficial method of data collection.

$I
A good example of this is given by Daisy Christodoulou in her book ‘Making Good Progress’.

<img

  alt="A line chart that displays a bell curve moving from Working Towards, through Working At, to Working In Greater Depth. Pupil A is marked as being nearly at the end of the first third and is assessed as Working Towards, pupil B is just in to the second third and is assessed as Working At and pupil C is marked at the beginning of the curve and first third and is also assessed as Working Towards. "
  width="616"
  height="355"
/>

The graph highlights that pupil A and pupil C are given the same grade; both have been classed as ‘Working Towards’. However, you can see that the scores of pupil A and pupil B are closer and they have more in common.

If you were to pay attention to the grade boundaries only, you may target pupil C and A more than pupil B. However, it is clear that pupil B has only just crossed the grade boundary and therefore could - in another summative assessment – be graded as ‘Working Towards’.

This highlights that grading systems can be misleading, and it is important that teachers consider the narrative around their data when making inferences and decisions based on their data analysis.

## Analysing data

Below are two possible activities, select only one that you wish to complete.

$CTA

<h3>Activity 1</h3>
Select a recent summative assessment completed by an individual pupil. This could
take the form of a test, a piece of writing, a performance or any form of assessment
that ‘sums-up’ learning over time.

Analyse their assessment carefully and consider the following questions:

<ul>
  <li>
    Is this assessment based on the ‘difficulty model’ or the ‘quality model’?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does pupil performance in this test reflect their general pattern of
    performance over time?
  </li>
  <li>
    As you analyse the test, has the pupil made mistakes, or do they have errors
    in their knowledge?
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Reminder:</h4>
<strong>Mistake</strong> – something a pupil can do, and does normally do correctly,
but has not on this occasion.

<strong>Error</strong> – which occurs when answering something that a pupil has not
mastered or has misunderstood.

Prepare to discuss your answers around the performance of this pupil with your mentor.

Record your findings in your notebook.

$CTA

<h3>Activity 2</h3>
Select a recent dataset and identify pupils that are very close to the boundaries
of their grades. This must include pupils at both the lower and higher grade boundaries.
Consider the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>
    Who are the pupils that are at risk of potentially moving into the lower
    grade boundary?
  </li>
  <li>
    Who are the pupils that, if targeted, could move into the higher grade
    boundary?
  </li>
</ul>
Select one pupil from the list you created using the questions above. What strategies
could you use to target this pupil and increase their progress?

Prepare to discuss your answers around the performance of this pupil with your mentor at your next interaction.

### Assessment

6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.

6.3 Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

6.4 To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.

6.7 Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.

_6b. Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance)._

_6c. Choosing, where possible, externally validated materials, used in controlled conditions when required to make summative assessments._

This session will take **approximately 42 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

For pupils to be successful in the classroom, they need to be able to access the curriculum being taught. However, for many pupils, there are barriers that prevent them from doing so. One potential barrier to learning is poor literacy skills (EEF, 2018).

You can support pupils’ literacy development whichever phase or subject you are teaching. To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- The importance of high-quality oral language

- Teaching vocabulary

  - Developing language in Early Years
  - Developing language in Primary and Secondary settings

## The importance of high-quality oral language

Speaking and listening are vital skills for pupils to acquire. Not only do they form the foundations for competency in reading and writing, but they are also essential for thinking and communication (Higgins et al, 2015). And while the ability to think and communicate enables pupils to access the curriculum, these areas are also essential for all aspects of life – during, but also importantly, beyond schooling.

In addition, disciplinary literacy recognises that oracy skills are both general and subject specific (EEF, 2019). For example, the ability to respond in full sentences is a general skill, whereas the ability to correctly interpret the word “evaluate” is subject specific. This is because some vocabulary can carry different meanings in different subjects. In English Literature, “evaluate” questions often require pupils to justify their answers with reference to a personal response. Whereas in Physical Education, evaluation could ask pupils to consider the consequences of particular choices relating to diet or exercise.

Therefore, developing pupils’ general and subject specific oracy skills should be a high priority for all teachers. Some ways you can develop these are by requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences and by teaching the meaning of vocabulary in the context of your subject.

During lessons, pupils need receptive and expressive language to access the curriculum. Listen to Kelly Challis, from the Driver Youth Trust, talk about the difference between expressive and receptive language, and ways you can develop both in the classroom.

Developing high quality oral language

$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
Having a focus on high quality oral language in the classroom is developing the foundation of good literacy skills. The first step in developing language skills is to consider your own language in the classroom:

<ul>
  <li>How accessible is it?</li>
  <li>How much you provide in one go?</li>
  <li>
    Do you use metaphors, sayings or subject specific vocabulary without
    explaining the meaning?
  </li>
</ul>
These are all important questions to consider.

Language can be split into two types: receptive and expressive.

Receptive language helps pupils <em>understand</em> spoken language by enabling us to:

<ul>
  <li>attend and listen to the speaker</li>
  <li>apply meaning to spoken words</li>
  <li>and understand grammatical markers.</li>
</ul>
Expressive language enables pupils to share their thoughts and feelings by:
<ul>
  <li>retrieving appropriate vocabulary from their memory stores</li>
  <li>recalling speech sounds and patterns</li>
  <li>
    and then mentally constructing the sentence according to grammatical rules,
  </li>
</ul>
To support pupil’s receptive language in the classroom, you should give instructions:
<ul>
  <li>in small chunks</li>
  <li>in the order you want them completed.</li>
  <li>And can use prompts such as first, then and lastly.</li>
</ul>
To ensure pupils have understood, you can encourage pupils to repeat back instructions
that you have given, whilst listening out for any misunderstanding.

To support pupil’s expressive language in the classroom you should:

<ul>
  <li>Model and teach high-utility vocabulary</li>
  <li>
    Model the correct response if the learner has made a grammatical error - pay
    attention to errors with plurals or tenses.
  </li>
  <li>Model the correct response with sensitivity</li>
  <li>Encourage pupils to respond to questions in full sentences</li>
</ul>
When modelling and teaching vocabulary, you can introduce it by sounding it out and
explaining its meaning before using it in a sentence. Plan to discuss unfamiliar
terms before reading or writing them and use these terms in a context that the pupils
will be familiar with to help them better understand.

Make discussion part of your classroom activity and use as a precursor to written work. During discussion, ensure you model good listening skills as well as oral language. Set the parameters for the discussion before it takes place and scaffold pupils responses by provide sentence starters such as,  ‘I would like to raise the point about…’ and the response to that which could be ‘I hear your point but I would like to say…’. By providing stock responses you support pupils to construct a good answer.

When asking pupils to share their ideas, ensure you give pupils time to think out loud and work through a response before. I always use the analogy of dropping a feather, rather than a stone, in a puddle to increase the thinking time I give pupils. To further support pupils who struggle to speak with clarity, consider recording their response for them to listen to. This will help them understand their current use of language which may help to identify where they can improve.

Without high quality oral language, pupils struggle to access the curriculum. Therefore, every teacher, regardless of subject or phase, should be a teacher of literacy.

As Kelly identifies, both receptive and expressive language enables pupils to access the curriculum. Pupils require receptive language to understand what is being asked of them, and expressive language to communicate their thoughts and ideas, and to demonstrate their learning. You can develop pupils’ vocabulary by:

- modelling using full sentences to respond to questions and encouraging pupils to do the same
- Implicitly and explicitly teaching vocabulary

## Teaching vocabulary

In their guidance report on developing literacy in schools, the Education Endowment Foundation (2017) recognise the importance of both implicitly and explicitly developing language.

### Implicit teaching:

To implicitly teach vocabulary, the teacher might model using a word when speaking, point it out during shared reading and use it when modelling or completing shared writing activities. Implicit teaching ensures pupils encounter regular repetition of the word, making it more likely that the word will transition into the pupils’ vocabulary.

### Explicit teaching:

To explicitly teach vocabulary, a teacher would present the word along with explanations and examples of what it means, and then ask pupils to experiment with using the word.

### A balanced approach

It is important that you both implicitly and explicitly teach new vocabulary, so that pupils are repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary, in any phase or subject, throughout the school day.

### Which words do you need to model and teach?

Isabel Beck and Margaret McKeown (2013) have created a helpful model that splits vocabulary into three different categories - Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. These are outlined in the figure below.

$Figure
$Alt The tiers of vocabulary from bottom to top are: Tier 1: words for everyday speech. Tier 2: high frequency words. Tier 3: Low frequency and domain specific words. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Tiers-of-ocabulary-3-800x300.jpg $EndURL $Caption ‘Tiers of Vocabulary’, adapted from $EndCaption

### What’s the difference between these tiers?

Listen to Kelly Challis explain how each tier is different, and how you might teach them in the classroom. Record notes in your notebook.

Tiers of vocabulary

$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
A rich vocabulary not only allows a pupil to communicate effectively, it broadens the reading material they can access and allows them to develop their written work. A concept popular in education is the use of tiered vocabulary, which is the theory from Beck, McKeon and Kucan.

The three tiers are all important but how they are taught and built and when they become a focus in the classroom differ.

Tier 1 are basic high frequency words. Words like clock, baby, big and small. Most of these words are learnt through speech in key stage one. However, some of these words may continue to challenge a learner, if they are trying to spell them.  Therefore, tier 1 words are great taught through little and often one to one spelling activities, where appropriate.

Tier 2 words are words which add richness to communication whether that is verbal or written. Tier 2 words are the ones which we build over years of reading a variety of text, of talking to different people with different experiences. They should be taught directly in the classroom, explored from both reading and a writing perspective. Tier 2 words cross subjects - they are applicable to many contexts and can be used in both speech and text

An example of the difference between tier 1 and 2 words would be ‘nice’ to ‘wonderful’ or ‘silly’ to ‘absurd’.

If you are working on a piece of text, it's the Tier 2 words that should be drawn out of that text before you teach it or read it as a class. This can be done by looking at meanings, finding synonyms of that word, putting into a context that the learners are familiar with. Before giving examples of when that word is being has been used in a sentence. During reading, highlight the words which have been pre-taught to draw pupil’s attention to them in context.  You should limit the new vocabulary you teach to 5 words or so a week and revisit them throughout the term to strengthen pupils long term memory of them.

Tier 2 words can also be instruction or command words and these for older children are useful to be taught explicitly and identify the differences between those. For example, you should teach pupils what it means to write analytically as opposed to writing a discussion.

Finally, tier 3 words are subject specific. They have a narrow reach when it comes to applying to other subjects. It is important for pupils to understand their meaning and application to the subject. What is less important, is being accurate in their spelling because they can be complex words. For those with literacy difficulties, to understand that word and to apply it in the right context is much more important than spelling it correctly. Tier 3 words are often introduced at the start of a topic, but teachers need to remember to refer back to them throughout the topic in order for them to become embedded in the memory of pupils.

Let’s summarise how to address each tier in it in schools. Tier 1 words, if pupils are still finding these a challenge after key stage 1, teach them discreetly and targeted to that particular pupil.  Tier 2 words should be a whole class activity to explore new vocabulary on a weekly basis. They are great for word walls because they apply to lots of different subjects. If they are used in a word wall, they should be supported by strategies of how to break those words down and how to write them and finally, tier 3 words, are subject specific so should change when the topic changes. They should be highlighted in text and if they are part of a worksheet these words should be given as a scaffold to learners with literacy difficulties to remind them to use them and reduce the anxiety of having to spell them.

### **How can you develop pupils’ language?**

There are a variety of ways that you might develop pupils’ language, and this is likely to vary depending on the age range you are teaching. Click on the most relevant link below to explore ways you can develop pupil language in the classroom.

#### [Early Years](#early-years)

#### [Primary and Secondary](#primary-and-secondary)

## Developing language in Early Years

It is important that you provide high-quality interactions to pupils to support their language development.

This can be done through strategies which engage pupils in discussion about the activities they are completing, or experiences they are having. There is a distinction here between talking _with_ pupils and talking _at_ them (EEF, 2018). Talking at pupils tends to be more passive, while talking with pupils is more interactive; it’s the interaction that is important for language development, because it gives pupils the opportunity to practise their speaking skills.

There are a variety of different frameworks that can be used as a guide to support you when interacting with pupils during everyday activities, such as Sustained Shared Thinking (EEF, 2018). This framework enables teachers to expose pupils to Tier 1 and 2 language.

### **Sustained Shared Thinking**

Sustained Shared Thinking is when two or more people work together to solve a problem, clarify an issue, evaluate activities, or extend a narrative (Siraj-Blatchford et al, 2004). During a task, the pupil(s) contribute their ideas and the teacher aims to extend and develop their thinking further by (EEF, 2018):

- **tuning in -** listening carefully to what is being said and observing what the child is doing
- **showing genuine interest -** giving whole attention, eye contact, smiling and nodding
- **asking children to elaborate** - ‘I really want to know more about this’;
- **recapping** - ‘So you think that…’
- **giving their own experience** - ‘I like to listen to music when cooking at home’
- **clarifying ideas** - ‘So you think we should wear coats in case it rains?’
- **using encouragement to extend thinking** - ‘You have thought really hard about your tower, but what can you do next?’
- **suggesting** - ‘You might want to try doing it like this’;
- **reminding** - ‘Don’t forget that you said we should wear coats in case it rains’
- **asking open questions** - ‘How did you?’, ‘Why does this…?’, ‘What happens next?’

Sustained shared thinking - Early Years at Reach Academy
If you require an audio description over the video, please watch this version: [Sustained shared thinking - Early Years at Reach Academy \[AD\]](https://youtu.be/dnU8JyewEjU)

Through these strategies, you can probe pupils to engage in conversation about the activities they are doing, which in turn develops their language. When doing this, it is also helpful to model using full sentences to respond to questions and encourage pupils to do the same.

## Implementing Sustained Shared Thinking

Now you are going to apply elements of Sustained Shared Thinking to a scripted interaction. In this activity, we ask that you focus on specific elements of Sustained Shared Thinking, which are outlined below.

Read the script of an interaction between a teacher (Saima) and a pupil (Pedro) that has taken place whilst the pupil built a tower block. Extend or amend Saima’s comments to include the following elements of Sustained Shared Thinking:

- clarify ideas
- use encouragement to extend thinking
- suggest ideas
- ask open questions
- encourage pupils to respond in full sentences (although not included in Sustained Shared Thinking, this is a good way to develop pupils’ language)

Record what you would say in order to do this in your notebook. You will share and discuss your response with your mentor in your next meeting.

$I

<h3>Scenario: Building a tower block</h3>
Pedro emptied the box of building blocks and sat down. He began to gather blocks
and stack them on top of each other. Saima sat down next to him and began to observe
what he was doing.

Pedro placed a small cube on the floor and then picked up a 3D semi-circle and balanced this on top. He then picked up another larger cube and tried to place this on top, but it fell down.

Saima said, “Oh no, it fell down!”.

Pedro began to build the tower again. He picked up the large cube this time and then placed the 3D semi-circle on top. He picked up a cuboid and tried to place this on top of the semi-circle, but the blocks fell down.

Saima said, “Oh no, it fell down again.”

Pedro said, “I use this one now.”

This time Pedro started with the 3D semi-circle at the bottom and tried to place a cuboid on top. He did it carefully so that it balanced.

Saima said, “Wow, that’s balancing.”

Pedro then placed another cube on top which stayed, and then another. He then reached for a large cube and placed this on top, but the tower fell.

Saima said, “Oh no – silly big block. It made the tower fall down.”

### Summary:

Sustained Shared Thinking is a powerful framework to use to develop pupils’ early language. When done well, it exposes pupils to high-utility language and extends their thinking. In your next mentor meeting, you will discuss your response with your mentor and practise using Sustained Shared Thinking.

## Developing language in Primary and Secondary settings

Vocabulary in the English language is extremely complex; one word can carry many meanings which are context and subject specific. For example, the word ‘prime’ in maths has a different meaning to the word ‘prime’ in English, which is why developing pupils’ disciplinary literacy is incredibly important. Pupils need to be explicitly taught the meaning of words in different contexts and subject disciplines. Therefore, _every_ teacher is responsible for developing pupils' literacy, including the teaching of vocabulary. This can be done by ensuring pupils have the opportunity to learn new words and explore ways to use familiar words in new contexts.

Vocabulary should be taught to pupils both implicitly, through modelling high-quality oral language, and explicitly, via the direct teaching of new words.

When explicitly teaching new words, it is important that you do so in a meaningful way. If you provide pupils with a long list of words without attaching meaning to them, they are unlikely to understand or use those terms at a later stage (Quigley, 2019). Instead, to make words more memorable, you should help pupils to attach meaning to them. This can be done in many ways, but this session will focus on teaching the morphology (parts) and etymology (origins) of words.

## Morphology

Morphology is the study of the structure and parts of words. Words can be broken down into their parts (morphemes) and each carries a meaning. By asking pupils to study morphemes, you can help them to attach meaning to abstract words.

The common morphemes pupils will learn about are:

- **root:** the primary part of a word which conveys most of a word’s meaning
- **prefix:** a morpheme added before the root of a word
- **suffix:** a morpheme added after the root of a word

Teaching pupils the meaning of different roots, suffixes and prefixes enables them to expand their vocabulary repertoire significantly. They will also develop an understanding of word-building, which they can apply to other vocabulary. Understanding word building helps pupils to decode unfamiliar words when reading, as they can infer what the word might mean if they understand a part of it, such as the root, prefix or suffix.

In the primary setting, you might teach pupils that the prefix ‘in’ can mean ‘in’, ‘on’ or ‘not’. After teaching this, you might ask pupils to explore the prefix in different words such as, ‘inject’, ‘influx’ and ‘insane’.

This develops pupils’ receptive and expressive language, as they gain an understanding of what the prefix ‘in’ means and how to use it in their own speech.

In the Secondary setting, you might combine morphology with etymology.

## Etymology

Etymology is the study of the origin of words. Many academic, subject-specific words have Latin or Greek origins (Nagy & Townsend, 2012). Pupils may find them trickier to understand as they are less frequently encountered in everyday language. You can teach these abstract words by helping pupils to attach meaning to them. This can be done by teaching the origins of their constituent morphemes. The example below helps to illustrate this.

### Example:

To help pupils understand what _photosynthesis_ means, you might teach them the morphology (photo-syn-thesis) and etymology (light-with-setting) of the word:

$Figure
$Alt Etymology of the work photosynthesis: Photo means light, syn means with or together and thesis means setting, putting or placing. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Etymology-4.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 2: ‘The morphology of Photosynthesis’, taken from $EndCaption
$EndFigure

## Teaching vocabulary in practice

When teaching any vocabulary, it is helpful to ensure that it is related to the topic that pupils are learning about (Teaching and Learning Toolkit, 2015). Teaching word meanings at the start of a topic and revisiting them throughout means pupils are more likely to comprehend the content being taught during lessons. It also means they are regularly exposed to the vocabulary throughout the topic, making it more memorable. They can hear it being used in context and have multiple opportunities to apply it during speaking and listing, reading, and writing.

There are many ways that vocabulary can be explicitly and implicitly taught. Choose one of the videos below to watch this in practice:

Developing language and vocabulary is critical in a pupil’s ability to succeed across the curriculum. English is both a subject in its own right and often the medium for teaching within many lessons. As such, developing language and vocabulary has a profound effect on whether a pupil is able to access all areas of the curriculum. Without developing language and vocabulary in lessons, pupils can struggle to access content and even exam and assessment questions, so it is vital, when considering the impact it may have upon their attainment. In addition, it can give pupils more confidence to discuss topics and consequently deepen their knowledge.

At the beginning of a year I usually have around 30 key terms that my pupils need to learn in order to gain a deep understanding of the topics I teach in a year. I want them to be able to use this vocabulary both during discussions inside and outside of the classroom, and when answering assessed questions.

I stagger the learning and application of these terms over the course of a unit. For example, in Year 9 we teach a module on Judaism, so at the beginning this unit, the pupils are presented with 8 key terms which centre around Jewish festivals, rituals and places of worship.

At home, pupils are asked to revise and prepare to be tested on these key terms. Formative testing is used to strengthen recall and assess whether pupils have improved their understanding of the vocabulary. This usually takes the form of a basic quiz where I read the key term and the pupils write down what they think the definition is.

Once pupils have mastered their knowledge and understanding of the key terms and definitions, I set formative exam questions which assess a pupil’s knowledge on a topic and their ability to apply key terms and definitions in their extended writing. I encourage pupils to use key vocabulary by making the link between using it and their attainment explicit. For example, in our Judaism module, pupils are aware that if they don’t use key Jewish terminology, they are unable to achieve the highest bands and the top marks.

Pupils are given verbal feedback on their exam essays and are encouraged to discuss the feedback given and how it could be implemented in their answers – giving them greater scope to use and apply subject specific terms, therefore building their vocabulary.

‘Learning talk’ is also a powerful tool for building language and vocabulary and is something I regularly build into my lessons. ‘Learning talk’ is when pupils verbalise what they understand about certain terms, topics or issues.  For example, I have, in the past, placed the word ‘Synagogue’ or ‘Bar Mitzvah’ onto the white board and set a timer of three minutes, asking pupils to discuss what they know about these key terms and consider how these words link to their own lives. This gives pupils a chance to explore vocabulary in a safe space where they can share their ideas and learn from their peers, which helps to build their more general and subject specific vocabulary.

**Now, think carefully about a topic you are teaching or are about to teach**. Choose to identify Tier 2 and/or Tier 3 vocabulary that needs to be taught to support learning.

**Tier 2 vocabulary** - words that you could expose pupils to as part of a whole-school approach to developing language.

**Tier 3 vocabulary** - subject specific words that pupils need to be explicitly taught to access the topic being taught.

When trying to identify vocabulary to teach, it is important you consider the topic or material you are teaching. When reviewing the topic or material, try to identify words that:

- Pupils _must_ know in order to understand the key concepts or material they encounter
- Words that are unlikely to be in pupils’ background knowledge
- Words that can’t easily be inferred

It may be helpful to talk to a colleague who has taught the topic or text before and can share their experience with you.

This session will take **approximately 45 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

In order to access the curriculum, pupils need to able to read. Every teacher can develop pupils’ literacy skills, including their reading ability.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- How do pupils learn to read?

  - Word recognition
  - Language comprehension

- Engaging parents and carers

- Developing writing

## How do pupils learn to read?

Reading ability can pose a barrier to many pupils in accessing the curriculum. Therefore, in order to support all pupils to succeed, you should develop their ability to read so they can meaningfully engage with the curriculum.

In addition, disciplinary literacy recognises that reading skills are both general and subject specific (EEF, 2019). For example, the requirement to decode words is a general skill, whereas the requirement to consider the author and their context when the text was written is subject specific. In Biology, a pupil may read an informational text about photosynthesis and assume that is it an authoritative account, suppressing thoughts about the author, whereas, in the English classroom, a pupil could read with an active awareness of the author.

Therefore, you should support pupils to develop their reading ability regardless of the phase or subject you teach. In order to do this successfully, you need to have a foundational understanding of how pupils learn to read.

**The** **Simple View of Reading** identifies two main elements that are required when reading:

- **Word recognition** – pupils being able to read or accurately decode words
- **Language comprehension** – pupils' level of understanding of the text

$Figure

Being at the bottom end of both scales results on poor word recognition and poor comprehension whilst being at the top end of each scale results in good word recognition and good comprehension. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/The-Simple-View-of-Reading.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 1: ‘The Simple View of Reading’ Adapted from $EndCaption

As the graph illustrates, pupils with good decoding and good language comprehension are typically good readers. Therefore, a balanced approach to reading, which develops both word recognition and language comprehension, is essential for pupils to be able to read.

Of course, reading is much more complex than simply decoding and comprehending; these two elements are made up of multiple strands.

Learning to read is a complex process, which draws on multiple knowledge sources and skills. This makes the process of reading development quite challenging to understand. Therefore, The Simple View of Reading is a great place to start as it highlights two connected but separable strands: word recognition and language comprehension.

So what does word recognition and language comprehension entail?

Simply put, word recognition is the ability to <em>read</em> individual words whereas language comprehension is a process used to identify the <em>meaning</em> of written or spoken language.

But in order to understand these two strands in a bit more detail, it is helpful to look at The Scarborough Reading Rope.

This diagram is useful to highlight the complex processes involved in both word recognition and language comprehension.

Word recognition is comprised of three main elements. When reading, pupils will use sight recognition to read familiar words, which means they can read the word just by looking at it. However, when they come across unfamiliar words, they will need to decode them, which means breaking a word down into its sounds – also known as phonemes. In order to be able to do this, pupils need to have phonological awareness, which is why early reading is taught through phonics. A pupil with poor word recognition may struggle to sound out complex vocabulary.

Language comprehension involves the integration of multiple sources of knowledge and skills. In order to comprehend a text, pupils need to have literacy knowledge, such as knowing to read text from left to right. They also need to understand the meaning of the vocabulary they read, and the syntax so they can make sense of words and sentences. Background knowledge of a topic is also important as this enables the reader or listener to verbally reason and make inferences. All these components weave together to comprise effective language comprehension. A pupil with poor language comprehension may struggle to understand what a task is asking them to do or misinterpret key points in a text.

How can you develop pupils reading?

The Simple View of Reading highlights the need for a balanced approach to supporting pupils to become fluent readers. Both word recognition and language comprehension need to be addressed. When supporting pupils to read, it is important that you are aware of the individual reading challenges your pupil face and what their next steps are to improve.

This is particularly important for pupils who are <em>struggling</em> with reading as they need to catch-up with their peers. The Simple View of Reading can support you in targeting pupils who are behind. By assessing both word reading <em>and</em> comprehension, you can identify which components need targeted development.

## Word recognition

Early reading should be taught using systematic phonics. Systematic phonics is part of the National Curriculum as it is underpinned by extensive research that shows it is the most effective way to teach pupils to read words (EEF, 2016).

Systematic phonics should form part of a balanced approach to developing reading during Early Years and in primary-aged children. If you are in the secondary setting, you should be aware of how early reading is taught, so that you can support pupils to continue strategies they learnt in the primary setting where necessary.

Teaching phonics develops pupils’ phonemic awareness (the ability to hear individual speech sounds) and teaches pupils about the relationships between speech sounds and letter combinations. When applying phonics during reading, pupils will break up unfamiliar words into individual sounds (segmenting) and then put those sounds together (blending) to say the word.

This is a very effective way for pupils to decode unfamiliar words. However, not all words are phonetic. That means there are some words which can’t be broken down into individual sounds. Therefore, a part of teaching phonics involves explicitly teaching pupils these ‘tricky’ words, so that pupils recognise them from sight.

Teaching phonics supports pupils with their reading and spelling, as it enables them to sound out a word as they write it.

### Summary

Phonics helps pupils to read unfamiliar words, but word recognition is only a part of the skill of reading. Pupils need to be able to understand what they read, which is why it is important to develop their comprehension in any phase or subject.

## Language comprehension

A balanced approach comprising of teaching both phonics and comprehension should be taken when teaching pupils to read. For pupils to understand words and sentences that they have decoded, they need to have good comprehension, but how can you support this development as a teacher?

## Comprehension strategies

Prior knowledge and understanding key vocabulary are essential for pupils’ comprehension. However, they are not the only factors that are important. Pupils need to be able to monitor their understanding of a text as they read, ensuring they remain focused while processing the text.

There are some specific strategies that Early Years, Primary and Secondary pupils can be taught to monitor their comprehension and overcome potential barriers (Teaching and Learning Tool Kit, 2015). These strategies are (EEF, 2019):

**Activating prior knowledge** – pupils think about what they already know about a topic, from reading or other experiences, and try to make links. This helps pupils to infer and elaborate, fill in missing or incomplete information, and use existing mental structures to support recall.

- If reading Cosmic – a story where a boy finds himself in space – pupils might consider what they already know about space.
- If reading a text about Henry VIII, pupils might consider what they already know about life in Tudor times.

**Prediction** – pupils predict what might happen as a text is read. This causes them to pay close attention to the text, which means they can closely monitor their own comprehension.

- If reading Chinye – a fairy-tale - pupils could predict what might happen to the character based on what they already know from the story, as well as what they know from similar stories.
- If reading about Migration in the UK, pupils might predict the impact of international migration on English seaside towns.

**Inference** – pupils infer the meaning of pictures or sentences from their context, and the meaning of words from spelling patterns.

- If reading a poem about World War Two, pupils might infer what different similes or metaphors are describing.
- If reading Tuesday – a picture book – pupils might infer why the frogs are looking up to the sky.

**Questioning** – pupils generate their own questions about a text in order to check their comprehension.

- If reading Oliver Twist, pupils might generate five key questions they hope to answer in the next chapter.
- If reading about an artist, pupils might generate five key questions they hope the text will answer.

**Clarifying** – pupils identify areas of uncertainty, which may be individual words or phrases, and seek information to clarify meaning.

- Pupils might come across words they don’t know the meaning of and seek to find this out.
- If pupils are reading non-fiction, they might check that they understand any images or graphs that are presented alongside the text.

**Summarising** – pupils succinctly describe the meaning of sections of the text. This causes pupils to focus on the key content, which in turn supports comprehension monitoring.

- After reading Little Red Riding Hood, pupils might tell their partner the key events that happened. A teacher might scaffold this using picture prompts.
- After reading a text on photosynthesis, pupils might write a summary of this process.

## Teaching comprehension strategies

It is important that pupils are explicitly taught these strategies. Detailed explanations and high-quality modelling, such as ‘Think Alouds’, should be used to teach pupils how to apply each strategy when reading. This helps to make the implicit strategies of a good reader explicit to pupils, providing them with techniques they can apply independently.

Before pupils are expected to apply these strategies independently, they must be given multiple opportunities to try out each one during guided practice, with a partner, or in a small group. Their independent use of these strategies should be built up gradually, until they are able to apply multiple strategies at once. The level of independence that pupils are expected to achieve when using these comprehension strategies will depend on the phase you are teaching, as well as any specific barriers to learning for a child.

$I

<h3>Subject specific comprehension strategies</h3>
The five strategies outlined can be used on both fiction and non-fiction texts. However,
the subject does matter, especially in secondary school. Therefore, it is important
that the model is adapted to suit the content you are teaching.

For example, the questions that pupils generate in English literature, might be related to character development or the mood generated by the author, whereas in P.E, the questions might be focused around physiological changes that happen to the body during exercise.

You might also include additional subject specific reading strategies. For example, in a history lesson, you might ask pupils to identify the source of the information they are reading or make notes on the context of when it was reported, such as the political climate.

Supporting reading in your subject is vital, and therefore, it will form part of the focus of your next training session.

## Engaging parents and carers

To help pupils develop their reading ability, it is important that they get as many opportunities to practise reading as possible. You can encourage pupils to utilise their time outside of school to develop their reading further. One way to do this is to engage parents, carers or families in their child’s reading development, which may increase the amount of time a pupil spends engaging with texts at home.

Why is it important for parents to read with their children at home?

The following poem by Dr Seuss sums it up well.

‘The more that you read,

the more things you will know.

The more that you learn

the more places you will go’.

Parents and carers should be informed that reading with their child can broaden their child's vocabulary and increase their knowledge which supports both word recognition and language comprehension. By helping to develop their child's literacy skills, parents and carers have the potential to improve outcomes for their children.

The Education Endowment Foundation -also known as the EEF - state that overall, there is consistent evidence that the level and quality of parental involvement in learning is linked to a child’s communication, language, and literacy capabilities and supporting parents to help their children learn has the potential to improve outcomes.

Promoting shared reading is one way to engage parents and carers in the education of their children. Research indicates there are benefits of reading to children <em>before</em> they can read themselves and reading <em>with</em> them when they do begin to read.

<em> </em>What approaches are useful for parents?

Approaches that focus on how to read effectively with children appear to be more successful than those which focus more broadly on the promotion of reading or on the provision of books according to the EEF.

It might be helpful to share with parents that successful reading is made up of many processes, which can be categorised into two strands: word recognition and language comprehension. There are also reading strategies that you can share with parents to support their child’s reading development.

Firstly, you can encourage them to ask a range of questions about the book to check for understanding such as:

<ul>
  <li>Asking questions using the five W’s - who, what, where, when and why.</li>
  <li>Asking a mixture of closed and open questions.</li>
  <li>
    Asking about and discussing the meaning of vocabulary - what does that mean?
    When else might you use that word?
  </li>
  <li>
    Asking their children to <em>summarise</em> what has happened so far and{" "}
    <em>predict </em>what might happen next.
  </li>
</ul>
Secondly, you can encourage them to support their children to see links between what
they are reading and the real world, which can help children develop their understanding
of ideas in the book itself. For example, while reading about Cinderella going to
the ball, a parent might discuss the similarities between a ball and a birthday party.

You can share these strategies with parents and carers and encourage them to read with their children at home by proactively seeking out interactions during school drop off or collection, or, if you don’t see parents regularly, then you can use parents evening as a good opportunity to talk to them about the importance of their children reading at home and provide them with approaches to do so.

All children can benefit from shared reading regardless of their age or reading ability. Sharing stories can stretch a child’s understanding of the world, fuel their imagination and expose them to a more sophisticated range of vocabulary and language structures which may not always be available to them in the books they can read alone.

As Kelly said, there are strategies that you can share with parents or carers to support them when reading with their children at home. In addition to this, it is important that you promote reading for pleasure to both your pupils and their parents or carers. You can do this in the classroom by reading a range of high-quality texts to pupils.

### Building relationships

Another benefit to engaging parents and carers in their child’s reading development is that it creates an opportunity for you to build effective relationships with them. This can improve a pupil’s motivation, behaviour and academic success.

One way to do this is by sharing children’s reading successes with their parents. For example, if you have been working with a parent to improve their child’s reading, or if reading is their child’s area of development, you could seek an opportunity to speak to parents/carers or send home a message in a journal to inform them of their child’s achievements. The message could say something like “Zack tried really hard to sound out the words ‘elements’ and ‘atomic’ in his science lesson today. He is working hard and making good progress in his reading.”

<h3>Reflection</h3>

  </li>
</ul>
Every school will have different policies on how to engage parents and how to support
reading at home, so this is something you should consult with your mentor about in
your next session. $CTA

## Developing writing

It is important that you invest time in developing pupils’ literacy skills in the phase or subject that you teach as part of a whole school approach to literacy.

Pupils need to master many different forms of writing across the curriculum in all key stages.

In upper KS2, there is an increased focus on <em>expository</em> writing. This is writing that is used to explain, describe or inform, for example essays, newspaper articles, instruction manuals.

In key stages 3 and 4, disciplinary writing instruction should be seen as inseparable from the teaching of the curriculum. So, there needs to be a focus on helping pupils develop a systematic way in which their writing responds to the questions posed in specific subjects.

For example, how a pupil might respond with the use of prose in history contrasts to the demands of science where pupils need to answer more succinctly using bullet points. Each approach requires development over time so that pupils can demonstrate their knowledge using the different writing approaches.

Given the importance of writing across the curriculum, it is essential that all teachers, regardless of phase and subject, are teachers of writing.

<strong>But what makes writing so challenging?</strong>

David McCullough, two-time Pulitzer prize winner, explains why writing poses challenges for pupils. <em>“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.” </em>

As in reading, there are many <strong>components </strong>which must be explicitly taught if a pupil is to become an effective <strong>writer</strong> including <em>handwriting, punctuation, spelling, word choices, paragraphing, imagery, word inferences. </em>

Therefore, you need to break down the basics of writing instruction into <strong>smaller chunks</strong>. Too often, pupils are expected to tackle more complex tasks, like writing an essay, before they have all the knowledge they require, resulting in an overload of their working memory. The impact of this is the pupil’s effort is not focused on the content of the lesson, but on the structure and organisation of the piece of writing. To prevent this, you can scaffold the structure so teaching the content becomes the primary focus.

How you scaffold writing is likely to be subject specific. For example, an Art teacher might explicitly model the skill of writing detailed <strong>annotations</strong> of sketches whereas a science teacher might model how to write an effective conclusion including Tier 3 vocabulary or an English teacher might model how to use a <strong>non-finite verb</strong> after a quotation to clarify understanding and develop a learner’s analytical skills.

Therefore, pupils should be taught how to write for different purposes and be given a significant amount of time to practise these domain-specific writing skills.

<strong>How can you teach effective writing?</strong>

Pupils need to understand that writing is a <strong>process</strong> not a singular activity. A good piece of writing is <strong>planned, drafted and edited</strong>. These stages are best taught using explicit teaching methods such as <strong>modelling</strong> <strong>whilst thinking aloud</strong>. To effectively model the writing process, you need to use high-quality, clear and succinct oral language.

Therefore, it is helpful to plan, script and rehearse what you will say when modelling.

<strong>Why is modelling so important when teaching writing?</strong>

Modelling and thinking aloud helps you to articulate some of the meta-cognitive approaches that happen automatically for you, and for some pupils, but not for others. Talking through your thought processes makes discreet steps explicit so pupils can understand the steps they need to take throughout the writing process.

Working with colleagues is a great way to practise modelling, so you can become adept at this important but difficult skill.

Another evidence-based strategy you can use when modelling is to provide pupils with a worked example on a visualiser or Inter Active Whiteboard. This could be one of their peer’s successful pieces of writing. You can then highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the whole text, for example, <em>vocabulary, a subordinate clause, an effective topic sentence</em>. This way, the successful elements are labelled by deconstructing the text into its building blocks. Pupils can then see:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>how</strong> a good piece of writing is created
  </li>
  <li>and what the features are of an effective written piece.</li>
</ul>
It is important to pitch this right to inspire rather than dishearten.

In summary, writing is a complex process, comprised of <em>three </em>main phases: <strong>planning, drafting </strong>and <strong>editing</strong>. <em>Each</em> phase needs to be explicitly taught by all teachers and broken down into chunks to avoid over burdening learners’ working memories. All too often, the most important phases - planning and editing - are only taught as a one-off activity.

You should embed writing instruction into the <strong>content</strong> of your curriculum and focus writing activities on what pupils are currently learning and reading about to ensure they have the prior knowledge required to successfully complete the written task.

This session will take **approximately 35 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Every pupil is different. They each come to school with a variety of different life experiences, prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning. Therefore, the pupils you teach are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support. Adaptive teaching can help you support all pupils to succeed.

In this session, you will explore:

- High-quality teaching
- Adaptive teaching
- Developing knowledge through pre-teaching

## High-quality teaching

The first step to supporting all pupils to succeed is ensuring they have access to high-quality teaching. This is sometimes known as Quality First Teaching. High-quality teaching is beneficial for all pupils, not just those who may have additional learning needs.

What strategies do you think would be considered high-quality teaching?

All the strategies would be considered as high-quality teaching.

You may recognise the strategies above as they have been covered earlier in the programme. The strategies listed are just some of the areas that would be considered high quality teaching - there are many more. The first step in supporting all pupils to achieve success is to develop your teaching practice so that you consistently deliver high-quality teaching. As the English SEND Code of Practice states:

<blockquote>
  High-quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the starting
  point in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN. Additional
  intervention and SEN support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality
  teaching.
  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Department for Education, 2014)</span>
</blockquote>
$EndContent $EndAccordion

An important part of high-quality teaching is seeking to understand your pupils’ differences, including different levels of prior knowledge and barriers to learning, and then being responsive to those needs. This can be done through adaptive teaching.

## Adaptive teaching

Adaptive teaching means being responsive to learners needs. This includes providing further challenge to stretch pupils’ learning and providing additional support and scaffold to support pupils who are struggling. There are many ways you can adapt your teaching, but this is less likely to be valuable if it causes you to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or set lower expectations for particular pupils. Adapting your teaching should be done in a meaningful way that will have a positive impact on pupils’ learning.

All pupils learn at different rates and require different levels of support to achieve so it’s important we adapt our teaching to meet the needs of all learners in the class.

Before I deliver a new topic, I have always found a good starting point is to consider where the learners have come from. Looking at the national curriculum, or progression maps informed me of what pupils will have already covered in other years groups that link to the topic I was about to teach. This supported me in pitching the sequence of lessons correctly as it helped to identify what existing skills I could build upon.

The next step was to use any available information I had that could tell me what the children’s learning needs would be in this area and more generally. Knowing my pupils was key here. Sometimes, I would give pupils a task to assess their confidence and competence in the given subject and other times I would use information that I already knew about the children to identify who might require additional support. Before teaching a topic, I would identify a selection of children to deliver a pre-teaching session to. These children would be pupils who lacked critical prior knowledge or required content to be further broken down. Pre-teaching would allow them to be at a similar starting point to their peers when new material was introduced to the whole class. One of the main things I focused on in these sessions was the vocabulary I would be covering in the topic. Research has found that many gaps in attainment can be linked to vocabulary comprehension and when these gaps are narrowed, pupils have a much greater chance of success.

During the lessons themselves, I ensured I made use of well-designed resources to ensure the learners were supported to achieve the learning goal. I also found it really useful to give myself and any other additional adult a specific role in the lessons by working with a target group to either provide additional support or challenge to pupils. I would often start by working with pupils that received pre-teaching, to ensure they were supported in embedding the content I delivered into practice. However, I would always ensure that these target groups were not static and built a culture of acceptance by reinforcing that these groups were fluid and any child could be in them at any given time.

How did I know which pupils to work with during a lesson?

I used a variety of formative assessment strategies, such as questioning, throughout the lesson to ensure that myself, my teaching assistant and the pupils themselves were aware of the progress they were making against the success criteria. This way, at any point in the lesson, I could shift my focus to a different target group. For example, if pupils I supported at the beginning of the lesson gained confidence, I could work with children who faced a different barrier in their learning. A particularly good strategy I have found when it comes to assessing who might need further support is the use of hinge questions. These questions quickly and effectively informed me and my learners of how well they understood something at a point in the lesson when a quick intervention could be implemented to support pupils to succeed in their next steps.

Towards the end of the lesson, I always found it useful for the children to self-assess against the learning goal by placing their books in colour coded trays. I personally used a traffic-light system, where green was used if they felt ready to go, amber if they were almost there and red if they were unsure. Generally, due to the work that had been done in the lesson to ensure pupils were on-track, there were few children who were left completely in the dark, but it still happens and it’s important for pupils to ensure they feel confident at sharing this!

Asking pupils to self-assess throughout, but especially towards the end of the lesson, helped me to prioritise my marking and feedback. Reading through the work and identifying common misconceptions present in groups of pupils helped to plan how I would group pupils in the next lesson.

In summary, the 5 greatest tools for me in adapting my lessons for the learners were:

<ul>
  <li>Knowing the children inside and out!</li>
  <li>Prioritising assessment opportunities throughout the lessons</li>
  <li>Planning for questioning that will support and extend</li>
  <li>Ensuring a fluid group structure</li>
  <li>
    Use marking and feedback opportunities effectively and consistently,
    ensuring that these are built into lesson and classroom culture

## Developing prior knowledge through pre-teaching

Throughout the programme so far, the importance of prior knowledge has arisen on numerous occasions. In module 2, you explored the importance of considering prior knowledge when planning how much information to introduce. In module 3, you explored how to support pupils to activate or draw upon prior knowledge when working independently by modelling using ‘Think Aloud’. In module 4, you explored how to use assessment to check for prior knowledge and identify possible misconceptions. In this session, you will explore how to develop pupils’ prior knowledge through pre-teaching.

Prior knowledge is important for learning for all pupils but especially those with additional learning needs because:

- **It reduces working memory load** – pre-teaching enables the teacher to further break content down into smaller steps which helps prevent working memory overload.
- **New knowledge is learnt by attaching to existing knowledge** – if pupils don’t have any knowledge of the material being taught, it is much harder for them to process and remember new information.

Therefore, pupils with poor prior knowledge are at risk from being unable to access the material you are teaching.

### How do you identify pupils who require pre-teaching?

Before you teach a topic, it is important that you assess a pupil’s prior knowledge and current understanding. As Katherine suggests in her video, this can be done by considering what pupils have already covered earlier on in the curriculum. However, just because pupils have been taught something, it does not mean they have retained that knowledge. We know from our understanding of how pupils learn, that information needs to be revisited in order to be retained. Therefore, you should be careful when making assumptions about pupils’ prior knowledge and where possible, assess pupils’ current level of understanding in a topic. This will help you to identify which pupils require pre-teaching before a topic or lesson.

Often, you will already know which pupils will benefit from pre-teaching based on your understanding of your pupils and your experience of working with them throughout the academic year.

### Using pre-teaching to develop prior knowledge

Pupils' prior knowledge can be developed in a variety of ways, but this session will focus on pre-teaching. Pre-teaching is when pupils are taught key information prior to it being taught in a lesson. Pre-teaching provides pupils with essential foundational knowledge that they can draw upon during a lesson. This is likely to increase the pupils’ attention, focus and motivation.

## Identifying material to pre-teach

When identifying what material to pre-teach, you will need to have secure subject knowledge and a good understanding of pupils’ needs. Therefore, it can be helpful to work with colleagues such as a subject or phase lead and your Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo).

When planning content to pre-teach, you should follow the same principles as you would when planning explanations during a lesson. Information should be broken down into small chunks and made memorable to avoid working memory overload. Pre-teaching should be an extension of the teaching sequence, breaking down the foundational knowledge into even smaller steps. Therefore, key vocabulary or facts that will be present during the lesson can be a good focus for a pre-teaching session. The example below demonstrates what this might look like in practice.

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
If teaching a lesson on the Ancient Egyptians, the key vocabulary or facts that might
be identified for pre-teaching are:
<ul>
  <li>Egypt</li>
  <li>Ancient Egyptians</li>
  <li>Tomb</li>
  <li>Tutankhamun</li>
  <li>Pyramid</li>
  <li>Hieroglyphics</li>
  <li>Shaduf</li>
</ul>
For best effect, the words above should be accompanied with a graphical representation
to support pupil understanding. $I

## What might a pre-teaching session entail?

The aim of any pre-teaching session is to teach pupils key information that will help them to access the material being taught in the classroom.

There are many ways that a pre-teaching session might run in school and it will be up to you to decide what is best for your pupils based on their needs and the material being taught. There is no one size fits all. You will need to decide on the number of pupils to include in the pre-teaching session, how long the session should run for, and how regular the sessions should be. You will also need to consider how the session should be delivered. It would be beneficial to work closely with your SENCo and other special education professionals to support you in making these decisions.

Below is one example of how a teacher could run a pre-teaching session:

$I
Adam, a class teacher, is about to begin a new topic on Ancient Egyptians. Through assessment and his understanding of pupils’ needs within his class, he identifies 4 pupils who would benefit from pre-teaching.

He looks at the first lesson he will teach and identifies key subject-specific vocabulary that will be present in the lesson. He knows that he must be selective with which vocabulary to choose - he doesn’t want to choose too many words and overload pupils’ working memory. As a result, he chooses five words that he believes the pupils will be least familiar with and which will appear most frequently.

He plans to run a ten-minute session to teach pupils the key vocabulary. During the session, he begins by explaining the vocabulary with the use of pictures, actions and non-examples (where appropriate) and asks probing questions to check understanding. He then presents one word to the group and asks them to share what it means with their partner. He works his way through the remaining vocabulary and provides corrective or affirmative feedback to pupils.
$I

In this example, the teacher is delivering the session. However, if you have additional adults available, they may be able to run the session provided you give them the correct resources and information that they need. If you don’t feel as though you have the available time and don’t have an additional adult to support with pre-teaching, the resource could be sent home with pupils. Parents or carers can work with their child to pre-teach material ahead of the lesson.

Working closely with parents and carers is very important when supporting all pupils to succeed and is something that will be explored in later sessions.

## Application to practice

$CTA
In this activity, you will begin to plan how you can support pupils who have different levels of prior knowledge to access a lesson you will soon teach. Draft a plan for a pre-teaching session to be delivered in school by yourself or by an additional adult, or to be sent home for parents or carers to deliver.

Use the following points to help you when planning:

<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the next lesson or topic where you think pupils will benefit from
    pre-teaching
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify pupil(s) who will benefit from pre-teaching either based on their
    prior knowledge or your understanding of their needs
  </li>
  <li>Identify key vocabulary or facts to include in the session</li>
  <li>
    Plan how you, an additional adult or a parent or carer will deliver the
    session
  </li>
  <li>Make use of existing well-designed resources where possible</li>
</ul>
You will share this with your mentor in your next meeting and this will be the practice
focus. $CTA

## Providing scaffolds within a lesson

Providing scaffolds during a lesson is an effective way to adapt your teaching to meet the different needs of pupils to support all pupils to succeed.

In this session, you will explore how to adapt your teaching to support all pupils to succeed by:

- Scaffolding learning through questioning
- Providing scaffolds through adult support
- Using flexible grouping
- Providing additional practice

## Scaffolding learning through questioning

As you explored in module 3, questioning is a powerful teacher tool. It can be used to both assess and extend pupil understanding. Very skilled teachers will develop pupil understanding by adapting questions to suit learners’ needs either by providing further prompts to help break problems down or further stretch by asking follow-up questions. In order to do this successfully, teachers will use a variety of open and closed questions to guide pupils’ thinking.

In module 3, you covered a variety of questions styles that extend pupils' understanding but how can you adapt your questioning to support pupils who don’t give the correct answer?

If a pupil provides an incorrect answer, there are a number of things you can do to support their understanding:

- Reframe the question to simplify it, possibly changing it from an open to a closed question
- Break the answer/process down into smaller steps by asking more questions
- Ensure you provide enough wait time between your question and a pupil’s response to allow them to process your question and think of their answer

Look at the two examples below. One is of a teacher’s response to a pupil who gives the correct answer and the other is of a teacher’s response to a pupil who gives an incorrect answer. Compare them to see how the teacher reframes and adapts their questioning to stretch pupil understanding or provide greater scaffold.

$I

<strong>Response to a correct answer:</strong>
Teacher: What is 103 x 5? Pupil: 515 Teacher: How do you know that? Pupil: because
100 multiplied by 5 is 500 and 3 times 5 is 15 so you put them together and make
515. Teacher: good, you don’t ‘put’ them together you…? Pupil: add them Teacher:
Can you put that into a full sentence? Pupil: You add 500 and 15 together which totals
515. Teacher: Brilliant, remember, we use mathematical language. $I

Teacher: As in, in which scene do we first hear Macbeth saying he has a dark side he’s hiding?

Pupil 1: Oh! Um. Act 1, Scene 3 or um 4. Is that right?

Teacher: Absolutely, I’d agree, it’s basically right from when he first appears, isn’t it. But pushing that a bit,
can you think of a phrase or line in which we can find evidence to back that up? [Pause] Jess?

Pupil 2: When he… when he says about his ‘black and deep desires’?

Teacher: …‘let not light see my black and deep desires’, exactly. It just works, doesn’t it? So what could Macbeth mean by that image of the ‘black and deep desires’, do you think?

Pupil 2: That he, you know, he’s got dark thoughts he wants to hide.

Teacher: The ‘black and deep desires’, sure, especially in terms of the company he’s keeping here – the public thing with this aside. Do you agree with that, Jack? What do you think about these ‘black and deep desires’?

Pupil 3: To the quotation? Um. I agree, I think, but I think it’s important that he’s… he’s keeping them deep,
hiding them away. You know, in the dark.

Teacher: In the dark?

Pupil 3: Because he’s um linked to darkness – they’re bad things, so they’re black and shameful, and he wants to hide them from the… from the light because…

Teacher: …because…

Pupil 3: Because um the light is like positive? It’s got hope and heaven linked to it, and it’s also like he’s
hiding from his from his fate which is the stars.

Teacher: I love that, yeah, the idea of control and directing himself. Irony! So the stars are a symbol of
fate? Why?

Pupil 3: Yeah because for the audience… for the Jacobeans… they believed their um fate was in the stars?

Teacher: I like the idea – that link to the modern horoscope thing, destiny, God writing in the stars...Nathan, what would you ask about that, though? In terms of applying to Macbeth’s actions?

Pupil 1: …about…?

Teacher: About Jack’s comment… about the stars and fate.

Pupil1: Oh, well… well, why is he hiding from fate if he’s… well, doing fate?

Scaffolding questioning by providing carefully considered prompts is an effective way to break problems or concepts down to support pupils’ understanding. In the example I am about to talk through, the focus of the lesson is on early impressions of Macbeth, but the conceptual focus is: to what extent can a person be judged for their thoughts as well as their deeds?

I started by posing a closed question to the whole class:

<strong>
  ‘When do we first find evidence of Macbeth’s dark or evil thoughts?’
</strong>

The benefit of closed questions is they’re quick and unambiguous. The straightforward answer that follows can provide a useful common foundation on which to build a more developed, more detailed and wider-ranging discussion.

Here, the closed question was directed at pupil 1 - a low- to mid-level attaining pupil who lacked confidence - to give them a sense of success at the beginning of the discussion. I was confident they would be able to answer this question because I circulated during the previous task to check.

The pupil responded by asking for clarification. Following the pupil’s request, I rephrased the original question for him as:

<strong>
  ‘In which scene do we first hear Macbeth saying that he has a dark side he’s
  hiding?’{" "}
</strong>

It’s the same question but put more simply. There’s a shift from the more ambiguous ‘when’ to directing the pupil to identify a specific act or scene. I also hint that the evidence will be something Macbeth says.

He responded with the correct answer, so I increased the challenge by asking a slightly more open question to the class:

<strong>
  ‘Can you think of a phrase or line in which we can find evidence to back that
  up?’{" "}
</strong>

After asking the question, I paused to ensure everyone was thinking of an answer before directing it to a different pupil – pupil 2.

From this, I confirmed her response and asked her a follow-up question to develop her thinking:

<strong>
  ‘So what <em>could</em> Macbeth mean by that image of the ‘black and deep
  desires’, do you think?{" "}
</strong>

I increased the challenge in this question by asking a more open question that relied on her interpretive understanding by using the word <em>‘could’ </em>rather than <em>‘does’.</em> I also included technical vocabulary – the word ‘image’.

I then increased the challenge in the question by making it more evaluative and asked a higher attaining pupil – pupil 3 - to extend their thinking:

<strong>
  ‘Do you agree with that, Jack? What do you think about these ‘black and deep
  desires’?
</strong>

Jack’s response suggested there might be more he could offer, so I prompted him to say more by restating:

<strong>‘In the dark?’</strong>

I then asked him to further build on his idea with additional prompts, such as... <strong>‘because...?’ </strong>and<strong> ‘...why...?’</strong>

I then returned to pupil 1 and supported him in generating a question for the class to consider.

I find that pupils benefit from having the layered escalation from short, closed questions with markers such as ‘when’ or ‘who’ to more open questions and then to higher-order evaluation skills often beginning with ‘why’.

## Providing scaffolds through adult support

There are many ways to scaffold pupils’ learning during practise, such as providing pupils with partially completed examples to reduce working memory overload or providing pupils with a checklist to prompt their cognitive and metacognitive processes, but this part of the session will focus on how working with adults can provide a scaffold to pupils.

When pupils are working on a task, either yourself or additional adults in the room can work with pupils to provide additional scaffold or further stretch. But how can you ensure additional adults are effectively supporting pupil learning?

## Utilising adult support to best effect

Research has found that teaching assistants (TAs) can have a positive impact on pupil achievement – but that this can only happen if they are given the support and tools through which to best make an impact (EEF, 2015).

Listen as Kenny from the Driver Youth Trust talks about how you can effectively work with TAs and make notes on the five strategies he discusses.

There has been a lot of research into the use of teaching assistants some quite negative:

<ul>
  <li>
    Howes (2003) found that teaching assistants’ support in class increased the
    amount of time pupils spent on task but did not necessarily result in an
    increased rate of learning.
  </li>
  <li>
    Blatchford, Bassett et al. (2009) – ‘The more support pupils received, the
    less progress they made, even after controlling for other factors that might
    be expected to explain the relationship such as pupils’ prior attainment,
    SEN status and income deprivation’.
  </li>
</ul>
and then more recently some positive research that looked at
<ul>
  <li>
    ‘Making best use of Teaching Assistants’ (Sharples, Webster and Blatchford
    2015)
  </li>
</ul>
This then fed in to ‘Maximising the impact of teaching assistants’ which is a nationwide
programme run in schools to help make sure TAs are able to thrive in their role and
contribute to positive outcomes for pupils.

The first question really is – What is the role of the TA?

The Professional Standards for TAs defines the role of the TA as:

<ul>
  <li>
    The primary role of the teaching assistant should be to work with teachers
    to raise the learning and attainment of pupils while also promoting their:
    <ul>
      <li>independence,</li>
      <li>self-esteem</li>
      <li>social inclusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
They give assistance to pupils so that they can access the curriculum, participate
in learning and experience a sense of achievement.

So how can I make best use of a TA when one is in my class?

Talk to them - get to know their name, their interests and the subjects they feel confident in. You can then explore their experience, what they know about pupils and how you can work together.

Prepare them for the classroom – let them know what you are going to cover in lessons and (time permitting) discuss areas that pupils might find difficult and what you can both do to address these difficulties. This might involve role play where one of you introduces the topic then the other asks questions to seek clarification, this also sets and example for pupils that it is okay to not know and that asking questions is absolutely the right thing to do.

Introduce them and their role – each lesson, have the TA stand next to you when you are introducing the lesson so that you can explain what will be covered and what the pair of you will be doing during the lesson. This is a great opportunity to raise the profile of the TA so that pupils see you working in partnership and that both of you support learning.

Check in on them – when they are working with a group if pupils check what is happening and what the TA is doing with their group. If you haven’t had time to discuss the lesson beforehand then this is a great opportunity to check the approach the TA is using and making sure it complements your own approach.

Ensure you and your TA work with a variety of pupils – the TA is not just there to support low attaining pupils. If these pupils are struggling, then perhaps they need more time with the teacher not less. Consider swapping groups with the TA so that you can work directly with the low attaining pupils, the TA can then work with other groups.

Gather feedback – when you have time at the end of the lesson or afterwards talk through what happened during the lesson, what worked well and what pupils might have found difficult, this can then extend into which pupils found specific parts of the lesson difficult. This knowledge can then support planning so that particular areas can be reinforced. If this can’t be done verbally, you could develop a way that your TA could record progress throughout the lesson and pass this to you when the lesson is over.

As Kenny mentions, some research has found TA support to have little or no impact, on pupil progress. This is often because if adult support isn’t delivered in the right way, pupils can become reliant on adult prompts, reducing their ability to work independently.

Teaching assistants can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers. For TAs to be able to add value, they should have planning time with the teacher so learning outcomes can be shared ahead of the lesson, as well as knowing which pupils to support and how. TAs should also be supported to work with pupils in a way that build pupils’ independent learning skills.

### Building pupils’ independent learning skills

Both you and your TA should aim to deliver quality additional support that builds pupils’ independent learning skills. Listen as Kenny talks through ways to build pupil independence when working with a group of pupils to scaffold learning. Make notes on the different stages of the scaffolding framework that he discusses.

A consideration to bear in mind when an adult works with a group is how are you or the TA developing independence in the pupils? How can you be sure that support is not given too soon and negatively impacting on the progress pupils are making? How can you be sure that the work the pupils are producing is their own? The Education Endowment Foundation’s scaffolding framework for teaching assistants and pupil interactions provides an effective model for both teachers and TA’s to use to ensure pupil independence is developed when working with an adult. It is a framework consisting of five layers that should be followed sequentially depending on the pupil’s performance.  The framework consists of the five following stages:

&nbsp;

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-scaffolding</strong> – this is the first stage. At the
    beginning of a task, adults should observe the pupil whilst they begin. This
    provides pupils with processing time
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prompting </strong>– this is the second stage. If necessary, the
    adult should provide prompts to support the pupil if they get stuck such as,
    what do you need to do now? how are you going to approach this? you can do
    this.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Clueing </strong>– this is the third stage. If prompts aren’t
    enough, the adult can provide clues such as, where can you find the
    information you need? How have you done this before?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Modelling</strong> – this is the fourth stage. If clues aren’t
    enough, the adult can model what pupils need to do, articulating the steps
    clearly for the pupils to implement immediately afterwards
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Correcting</strong> – this is the final stage and should only be
    used where absolutely necessary. This stage is where no independent thought
    is being developed. This can be useful occasionally for developing
    confidence but, where possible, adults should only drop down as far as the
    modelling stage to encourage some level of pupil independence.
  </li>
</ol>
$EndContent $EndAccordion

By using the scaffolding framework, you can support all pupils to access to a rich and inspiring curriculum, whilst demonstrating high expectations by challenging them to be more independent in their learning.

The Education Endowment Foundation has two useful documents that you may wish to read for further information about how you and your TA can effectively work with groups of pupils:

In EYFS I think the role of an assistant teacher (AT), which is our name for teaching assistants, is slightly different to elsewhere in the school as when we’re in free flow we are both basically doing the same thing; either supporting children in an adult led focus group or developing their learning through play. However, during carpet sessions, I mostly lead and my AT supports with behaviour as well as providing scaffolding for children who need more support to access the curriculum. In addition to this she runs some interventions throughout the day and is generally just awesome.

<strong>How do you prepare your TA for this? </strong>

So, we reflect together at the end of each day in terms of both what went well and what wasn’t so great. Thinking about learning and any social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) things that have arisen that need addressing either that evening, perhaps a phone call home, or tomorrow by adapting plans and lessons. I try to go through the day each morning and we have about 20 minutes together before the kids arrive to go through the day and set up our activities and resources. Though I am really lucky because Muna and I get on really well, this is our second year working together now so our communication is a lot quicker and clearer than it first was.

<strong>What impact does this have on pupils?</strong>

The reflections at the end of the day are particularly impactful and important for us as a team. We both try to be honest around the progression of learning throughout the day. Due to the nature of EYFS and us often being in different rooms, and working with different children on different areas of the curriculum, Muna often sees things that I don’t and vice versa. So, sharing what we’ve observed means we can accurately adapt planning to suit the children's needs for the next day. Also, taking the time to go through everything in the morning ensures that Muna is prepared and has any manipulatives ready that she might need to support during carpet sessions so that learning is accessible to all students, as far as possible.

<strong>
  How do you ensure all pupils get a similar amount of support from both you and
  your TA throughout the day/week?
</strong>

I guess, honestly, we don’t on a daily basis. Unfortunately, because we are in a temporary site, we don’t have free flow inside and outside but we do have two rooms to make up for it. We try to ensure that we spend one of the ‘activity times’ in each room per day so we get to see a wider range of the provision but we allow children to mostly choose where they would like to play and learn so it could be that one child spends an entire day in the rooms I’m in. We alternate who does the English focus groups each week so we both see every child write once a fortnight, at least. Also, we split for phonics but adapt the groups and swap around every six weeks so we both get to work with all of them across a term. I think it’s difficult to monitor exactly how much time you both spend with each child per week let alone per day. I think that’s why it’s important that you communicate frequently and obviously we monitor through observations on Tapestry and in our Learning Journals as well.

Alternatively, if you do not work with a TA, think ahead to the next lesson you will teach where pupils might benefit from working with you and record at least two ways that you will develop their independence.

## Using flexible grouping

How to group pupils is one of the many decisions you will need to make. Sometimes pupils may be grouped by attainment. For example, in primary schools, pupils may be grouped within class by the tables they sit on and in secondary schools, pupils may be set or streamed into different classes. This is often done so teachers can pitch the lesson to meet the needs of all pupils.

However, research shows that attainment grouping can be detrimental to learners, particularly low attaining pupils. Some research suggests that being placed in a low attaining group may negatively impact pupils’ confidence and attitudes towards school and learning as they may develop a belief that their attainment is fixed (EEF, 2018). Therefore, care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.

A flexible approach to grouping pupils within class can be used as an effective way to provide tailored support. This means grouping pupils based on their learning needs, which will be dependent on the subject-specific material being taught.

You might group pupils in advance of a topic you teach or during the lesson based on your assessment of their progress. You will most likely use both approaches to ensure you provide tailored support to pupils. In order to group pupils effectively, you should:

- Make sure any attainment groupings are subject or topic specific. For example, one pupil may be a high attainer in the respiration system but a low attainer in animal digestion, and so should be grouped accordingly.
- Monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation, especially for low attaining pupils.
- Change groups regularly to avoid the perception that groups are fixed.
- Hold high expectations for _all_ groups, ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum by ensuring you don’t simplify content taught but instead scaffold pupils’ ability to access the content. This can be done in many ways such as providing partially completed examples or checklists to direct and prompt thinking.

Choose one of the videos below to listen to a teacher talk through an example of when they used flexible grouping to provide targeted support. When listening, consider:

- **How do they assess pupils’ understanding?**

Flexible grouping is a great way to respond to the needs of the pupils within my class. One example of when I used flexible grouping was when I was preparing to teach a different concept in Maths. For example, some children may thrive with the four operations, but others may struggle to understand the concept of time.

When planning the sequence of lessons, I drew upon data from termly formative assessments and attainment from the previous academic year of this specific topic to identify pupils who might struggle to understand the concept of time and may require content to be broken down into smaller steps than their peers. I identified a group of 5/6 pupils who I thought would require additional support when introducing the concept so in the first lesson of the sequence, I planned to work with these pupils during independent practice to ensure they developed secure foundational knowledge. This gave children the opportunity to take risks with their answers and have high expectations of themselves. Fluidity within grouping enables me to provide first – hand intervention within the classroom dependent on the needs of the children.

During the lesson, throughout my explanations and modelling, I used formative assessment to check pupils’ understanding to help me identify when pupils were ready for independent practice and to refine who I would support during this. I identified one of the target pupils was really excelling whilst another pupil who I hadn’t previously identified, was struggling to grasp the concept. This meant I needed to adjust who I had planned to work with to ensure I provided support to those pupils who required it the most.

I asked those pupils to work with me so I could provide additional explicit instruction and support pupils through guided practice. Children worked at a gradual pace meaning content coverage may not be at a greater depth as compared to other groups but meeting their needs is the priority. Being able to remain flexible, showing children step by step what is expected of them through thorough modelling and allowing the children to use practical equipment such as analogue clocks was key to building their confidence furthermore.

Adapting my lesson to respond to pupils' needs helped to ensure the 5/6 target pupils I worked with developed a strong foundational understanding of time.  This meant they were able to achieve meaningful success in the lesson. I try to ensure I work with a variety of pupils through this method either to support or extend pupils. For example, when reviewing pupils work following that lesson, I identified a group of pupils who had got all their answers correct. So, the next lesson, I planned to work with them to extend their learning further by providing them with more reasoning and problem-solving questions. These questions included multi- steps to increase their independence and thinking skills.

I find that by working with different pupils throughout the week, I can meet the needs of all pupils in my class. This ensures all pupils get the opportunity to work without an adult, helping them to self-regulate their learning. It also helps to prevent any stigma being attached to working with the class teacher. I find this has a positive impact on pupils' motivation and their attitudes towards learning.

Adaptive teaching is on the spot, responsive adaptation of a lesson, or part of a lesson, in response to pupils who may need more support, scaffolding or modelling, and without which they would be unable to move on to the next step of the lesson because they haven’t grasped something or are making too many errors. A key message here is don’t be a slave to a lesson plan! You may have to adapt or modify your lesson based on pupils’ needs: after all, a plan cannot account for every eventuality in your lesson.

How you adapt your lesson will be inextricably linked to the assessment for learning that will be taking place during your lesson: for example, questioning might reveal misunderstandings or errors that need to be corrected before moving on. If we see learning as a stepped process of progression, then it is clear why we would have to adapt our teaching if this situation occurred.

There are many assessment for learning strategies that I use during a lesson to gauge pupil knowledge: for example, I often use question and response using mini whiteboards, or using targeted questioning, whereby I question a selection of pupils to sample responses from around the class.

In a recent lesson, I asked pupils to use mini whiteboards so I could assess the whole class during Q and A. Pupils used their whiteboards to practise a range of punctuation accurately with the ultimate aim of writing a descriptive paragraph that demonstrated they could punctuate effectively. Because I could see what the pupils had written, I was able to identify those pupils that needed further scaffolding to use semi colons. I knew they would require further support during the activity to avoid misconceptions or errors becoming embedded in their writing.

As a result, I bought those three pupils around a desk to work with me, while the rest of the class moved on to the independent descriptive writing task. It was very important for me to adapt the lesson progression for this group of pupils in order to support them to be successful in the next steps of the lesson. If I had ignored the errors, then they wouldn’t have been able to achieve the specific aim of the writing. Their journey through the lesson had to be modified on the spot based on the assessment evidence.

Through the use of flexible grouping, the identified pupils were able to successfully achieve the aim of the writing task, something which would have been impossible for them if I hadn’t provided additional support and scaffolds based on their specific needs and knowledge gaps.

Flexible grouping uses pupil data to organise pupils into temporary groups. These groups will change regularly, based upon the needs, knowledge and skills of the individual pupils. A key factor of flexible grouping is that while all pupils are working towards the <em>same </em>learning goal, the work addresses pupils’ varying learning needs. Flexible grouping is a powerful and effective form of scaffolding, which can have a positive effect on pupil engagement and attainment.

Flexible grouping is most effective when it utilises different forms of data, such as that taken from formative and summative assessments or from teacher observation in prior lessons to create groups, with the desire to improve every pupil, regardless of the teaching task. For example, I used flexible grouping when I taught a lesson on exams skills and specifically, the benefits of using appraisal – by this I mean, giving value to a piece of evidence – in RE extended writing answers. I spent two thirds of an hour-long period looking at examples of when appraisal is applied correctly and incorrectly in model answers, whilst also giving my pupils the opportunity to practice this skill. At the end of the hour the pupils completed an exam question in which they were expected to demonstrate an understanding of how to appraise effectively. However, after marking these answers it became apparent that six pupils were still unsure of what appraisal was and how it could be applied in their answers.

So, with this in mind, in the next lesson I placed all pupils in the class in groups and gave them tasks based on their performance in the exam question attempted. The six pupils who had shown a lack of understanding with regards to appraisal and its application were placed into a group led by me. I was able to work with these pupils closely, giving them, at times, one-to-one tuition and guidance regarding how they could appraise. I was able to use flexible grouping to break down the concept and address any misconceptions that the pupils had in this area. Once I was confident that they had understood how to apply this skill, we completed an exam question together, creating a model answer which they were able to use as a point of reference in the future.

One of the real benefits of using flexible grouping regularly is that you can work closely with all pupils that you teach at different times, depending on their needs and the task you are giving them.  This helps to reduce the stigma associated with working with the teacher, as it becomes a common part of your lessons.

Intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups can sometimes be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils, but this will depend on the extent of the learning needs you are responding to. You need to carefully consider which approaches will be most beneficial for the pupils you teach. This is likely to differ for different individuals in different topics, subjects and contexts.

In the examples above, all teachers were able to respond to the needs of their pupils within the lesson using their flexible approach to grouping. However, sometimes providing additional support or practice within a lesson is not enough and pupils require additional practice after the lesson.

## Providing additional practice

Sometimes, adapting your teaching before or during a lesson isn’t enough to enable all pupils to achieve success. Where this is the case, you may need to build in time for pupils to have some additional practice.

There are a variety of ways in which you could do this:

- Incorporate the practice of a skill during a settling task
- Recap the material the following lesson and work with the identified group of pupils to develop their understanding before progressing them onto the next task
- Set the task for homework and ensure worked and partially completed examples are provided as a scaffold. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.
- Recap key content before the next lesson through a pre-teaching session
- Build in additional practice for all pupils across the curriculum by carefully planning where to use concrete and abstract examples, where to revisit key concepts and ideas and where to incorporate retrieval practice. This will be explored further in module 6.

The strategies you use will depend on both the material being taught and the level of understanding that your pupil has.

Name writing in Reception often needs additional practice. Individual children demonstrate their name writing in early Literacy sessions with tasks that are planned, however a few children often need that little extra support on top of this provision. To support this teachers often plan continuous provision activities that develop name writing in most areas of the classroom. For example within one classroom we have name cards to copy in the writing area, name cards near the painting easel to add names to the back of paintings, name cards in the construction area to label their models with their names, children write their names in the role play area etc. All planned in to children’s independent play

During Autumn One in Reception children often enter school with immature fine motor skills. This effects both pencil and scissor control. To give children additional practice staff ensure activities are planned in to develop this learning both indoors and outdoors. Children who need further support are given the opportunity to cut paper and materials in a tuft tray, take scissors outdoors to cut the grass/plants, use scissors to cut the dough and other materials within everyday provision. This builds up their muscle tone and impacts on the pupil’s fine motor progression.

Mathematics activities are often given additional practice after being introduced within a maths lesson. Children often ask staff to leave activities out to gain additional practice and at the same time staff are able to recognise the need for further practice and annotate plans to demonstrate child need and/or interest in the activity.

When marking books after a lesson or ‘live’ marking with pupils during a lesson, it becomes apparent which pupils have grasped a concept and can apply their knowledge of it independently, and which pupils still need some support.

While teaching a lesson on fractions, decimals and percentages, I assessed pupils understanding through discussions during explanations and modelling and it seemed as though all pupils had a good understanding. However, when marking their work after the lesson, it became clear that a small group of pupils needed additional practice around <strong>adding mixed number fractions </strong>as they’d struggled to complete the task successfully when working on their own.

They were able to do the work while I was working with them and offering prompts, but I identified they had struggled to apply their understanding when left to work independently.

I wanted to address this as soon as possible so I asked my classroom assistant to practice this skill with the pupils <strong>immediately after lunch</strong> <strong>the same day</strong>.  I ensured the practice activity focused on exactly the same skill that the pupils struggled with when working independently. After gathering feedback from my classroom assistant, it was clear that the pupils would require additional practice to consolidate their learning. As a result, I ensured that in the next maths lesson this small group would begin by working on fluency examples before progressing to a reasoning activity, which the rest of the class where working on. I closely monitored their work so I could provide affirmative or corrective feedback immediately to ensure they didn’t learn or embed misconceptions.

To consolidate learning, I know that pupils need regular practice to build up retrieval strength of the material they are learning about.  Therefore, I included questions that required pupils to <strong>add mixed number fractions </strong>in the daily arithmetic practice <strong>for the rest of that week.</strong> <strong>In our school, daily arithmetic practice is completed when they come into school every morning.</strong> I found that a little and often approach is an effective way of incorporating additional practice in any area rather than overwhelming the pupils with lots of, what they might see as, ‘extra work’.

As further additional practice, I offered short lunchtime booster sessions, usually 5-10 minutes long, which pupils could attend if they felt they needed more practice. In these sessions, I was able to sit with the pupils in a more informal way and go back through their work to address misunderstanding and consolidate their learning.

The variety of additional practice provided has had a really positive impact on pupils learning. By completing the same types of questions daily, the pupils are given the chance to repeat and embed knowledge and understanding.

Plate tectonics and their associated hazards can be a very tricky concept for pupils to learn and understand. Because of this, I plan to teach the concept spaced throughout the curriculum, each time revisiting and building on what was previously covered. Sometimes re-teaching is required when assessment indicates a lack of understanding of foundational knowledge.

In the case of Plate tectonics; the concept is revisited and practised using different examples, situations and contexts. This interleaving and spacing of threshold concepts is planned into the medium term plan to ensure pupils get the opportunity to revisit and practice material they have previously covered.

In this case the pupils had already studied plate tectonics twice, looking at plate movement and the formation of the Himalayas and then at a later date looking at the destructive plate margin of Monserrat. This time the plate boundaries are covered again looking at the similarities and differences of each boundary and their resultant features; this allows additional practice of the concepts already learnt but in a different context. However, key language is kept the same to support recall of key information and to help pupils attach new information to their existing schema.

I find that retrieval practice of threshold geographical concepts helps pupils remember fundamental information. It also allows pupils to see the wider picture of how different topics in geography are connected and relevant to one another. Knowing which topics will require additional practice before a lesson is taught is vital in ensuring additional practice opportunities are planned in. As a result, good subject knowledge is paramount.

I also find that question level analysis after key assessments is a fundamental tool when planning for additional practice as it helps to identify areas where there is a lack of understanding or misconceptions. This information is then used to plan future lessons. This could be to reteach a concept or interleave a key skill in future lessons.

The impact of this reflective system of practice is that no pupils are ‘left behind’ and therefore can continue to deepen their understanding of the key concepts.

### Classroom practice

4.6 Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

4.10 How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.

4.11 Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.

_4n. Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required._

### Adaptive teaching

5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.

5.5 Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.

_5b. Making use of formative assessment._

_5f. Balancing input of new content so that pupils master important concepts._

_5g. Making effective use of teaching assistants._

_5j. Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions._

_5k. Reframing questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch._

_5l. Considering carefully whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils._

_5m. Applying high expectations to all groups, and ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum._

_5n. Changing groups regularly, avoiding the perception that groups are fixed._

_5o. Ensuring that any groups based on attainment are subject specific._

### Professional behaviours

8.5 Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.

_8j. Sharing the intended lesson outcomes with teaching assistants ahead of lessons._

_8k. Ensuring that support provided by teaching assistants in lessons is additional to, rather than a replacement for, support from the teacher._

This session will take **approximately 30 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Supporting pupils with a greater level of need can be challenging. The SEND Code of Practice has been developed to support you to teach pupils who may require additional provision.

In this session, you will develop your understanding of the SEND Code of Practice by exploring:

- The SEND Code of Practice
- The graduated approach

## The SEND Code of Practice

As you have seen in previous sessions, adapting your teaching practice to support all pupils to succeed does not necessarily mean an increase in workload. The strategies that have been covered so far in this module are all features of effective high-quality teaching. By mastering the use of these methods (e.g. effective scaffolding, deployment of support staff, and flexible grouping) you will be supporting most of your pupils to succeed at a task.

Building these strategies into your everyday practice should be the first step taken to support all pupils to succeed. However, there will be a small number of your pupils for whom these strategies need to be developed further.

There are a number of reasons why a pupil may require further adaptation to practice. For example, it may be permanent adaptation; to support a pupil with a hearing impairment you may learn key signs or wear a microphone. Alternatively, the adaptation may only be required at a specific point in their education, such as the supporting of the emotional health and wellbeing of a pupil whose parents are separating.

Pupils with SEND may need a more personalised level of adaptive practice in order to access and achieve in all areas of the curriculum. [The SEND Code of Practice (2014)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/398815/SEND_Code_of_Practice_January_2015.pdf) is a document that supports teachers and leaders to understand their responsibilities and duty of care towards pupils with a special educational need. The Code of Practice itself is 292 pages long, so how can it be used by teachers to help inform their practice? Hear from Kenny Wheeler, from the Driver Youth Trust, as he highlights key points from the document that every teacher should be aware of.

The SEND code of practice: <strong>0 to 25 years (revised January 2015) </strong>explains the duties of local authorities, health bodies, schools and colleges to provide for those with special educational needs under part 3 of the Children and Families Act 2014.

In total, the SEND Code of Practice is 292 pages long. So how can it be used by teachers to help inform their practice?

Key parts for educational settings relate to chapters 5, 6 and 7:

Chapter 5 outlines expectations for early years settings such as nurseries. Chapter 6 outlines expectations for schools, this includes identifying SEND, describing the four broad areas of need and special educational provision in schools including SEN support and requests for EHCPs as well as working with pupils, parents and external agencies. This chapter also details what should be included in the schools SEN Information Report and details the role of the SENCo. Chapter 7 outlines statutory duties in post 16 institutions.

The four broad areas of need 6.28 to 6.35 is helpful as it outlines some of the barriers some pupils may experience in the learning environment.

The Broad areas of need are:

Communication and interaction – this is where a pupil has speech, language and communication needs. For example, they may have difficulty communicating what they mean or understanding the rules of social communication. There may also be issues relating to social interaction and not be able to understand the needs of others.

Cognition and learning - this is where young people learn at a slower pace than their peers. Young people might have a moderate, mild or severe learning difficulty which impacts on them accessing the curriculum. This extends to profound and multiple learning difficulties – also known as PMLD - where young people experience profound barriers to accessing the curriculum if there aren’t significant adaptations made to the lesson or additional resources provided.

Social, emotional and mental health barriers - this is where young people experience social and emotional challenges which can manifest in a multitude of ways. For example, some behaviours may be disruptive and attention seeking whilst others might be more withdrawn. Some behaviours may reflect underlying mental health barriers such as depression or anxiety.

Sensory and/or physical needs - this is where young people have a disability which impacts on them accessing educational provision provided for them. This may include a hearing impairment or visual impairment resulting in the young person requiring additional resources or support to access the curriculum. It may also be the case that a young person has a physical disability which again requires additional resources or support to help them access educational provision.

An important consideration for you, as their teacher, relates to the steps you take in order to deliver high quality teaching. Part of this involves identifying barriers that pupils may experience and considering how these will influence planning, use of resources, style of delivery and general interaction with pupils.

In part, the Code of Practice encourages teachers to take a step back and consider the information that already exists. Essentially, you are not starting with a blank page, there will be data and other key information that can support you in adjusting your approach to help pupils access the curriculum. For example:

<ul>
  <li>
    Primary schools will have the early years profile to draw on and gauge the
    areas of development for a pupil. There will also be information from the
    phonics screening as well as internal assessments which show a learner’s
    profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Secondary schools will have data and information from feeder primary schools
    as well as that produced by the assessments, they run e.g. CAT scores,
    reading assessments and again will have their own in-house assessment
    systems.
  </li>
</ul>
There may also be additional information by way of reports from specialists which
detail where an individual’s relative strengths and weaknesses lie.

Parents will also be an invaluable source of information relating to their child. They will be able to share their own observations and experiences of the child’s development. This insight might also include strategies and approaches that work as well as highlighting key areas of difficulty so make sure you invest time in communicating with them to involve them in the process.

The Code of Practice encourages a consultative approach which can help support you to gather information from a range of sources and then synthesise this information with the support of other key stakeholders such as, parents, colleagues and external professionals. Rather than be data rich and limited with analysis, the Code of Practice encourages you to be reflective, to make sense of the information to hand and use it to inform your teaching.

Equally, the Code of Practice highlights that classroom teaching is effectively the first line of intervention or support so before seeking to place a pupil on a provision that is different from or additional to normal provision, you should aim to understand what is going on in the classroom first of all. Only once you have a clearer understanding of what is happening within the classroom and have gathered evidence of what is working and where barriers persist, can you then make more informed decisions of what would constitute the most appropriate provision in the future.

### Four broad areas of need

As mentioned in the video, the Code of Practice highlights four broad areas of need. These are:

- **Communication and interaction needs** such as Asperger’s Syndrome
- **Cognition and learning needs** such as dyslexia
- **Social, emotional and mental health difficulties** such as an attachment disorder
- **Sensory or physical needs** such as visual impairment

It is useful to know which of the broad areas of need your pupil’s diagnosis falls into, as it can then help you with the identification of strategies to support you in adapting your practice.

Any SEND reporting will ask for the pupil’s ‘primary’ area of need. However, it is highly likely that a pupil may have learning needs that fall into more than one of the broad areas so this should be considered when planning any support.

## The Graduated Approach

When supporting pupils with SEND to access the curriculum, the Code of Practice recommends adopting a graduated approach to your practice. This approach helps you to find out what strategies will support pupils to access their learning, and crucially, which strategies aren’t working for them. It involves working with many different stakeholders such as the pupil themselves, parents or careers, outside agencies and very importantly, the SENCo at your school. The extent to which these stakeholders are involved will depend on the pupils’ needs. The graduated approach can be used to support any pupil who requires more personalised adaptions in order to access learning; they do not have to be diagnosed with SEN.

The graduated approach consists of four stages: **assess, plan, do, review**. It is designed to put the pupil at the centre, and each stage supports the teacher to make adaptations to their learning environment or practice to better support the individual pupil.

The cycle is continuous and can span a short period of time, (around 2 weeks) or can be used over a longer period (over a half-term). As such, it enables the teacher to be responsive to what is working well, and to stop actions that aren’t having the desired impact.

$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
Chapter 6.44 to 6.56 of the Code of Practice highlights the graduated approach that teachers can take in order to find out what may help a pupil and what might not help them.

From the outset it is worth stating that we are looking at the behaviours exhibited or experienced by the individual. We are observing where difficulties occur and how they manifest or impact on the individual accessing the curriculum. What we are not doing is trying to diagnose or label an individual as having a learning difficulty. At the initial stage of the graduated approach we are collecting evidence and then using this to help inform future practices, approaches and strategies that we might use with an individual.

Although we are referencing the SEND CoP, good practice dictates that we review where a pupil is performing and look at what we can do to assist them in accessing learning within the classroom. This does not mean that we are saying that the individual has SEND it is more a case of looking to see what works, what doesn’t and what needs revising.

<strong>Assess</strong>

At this point we are gathering / collating the evidence we have to hand; this might be from:

<ul>
  <li>our own observations within the classroom or around the school</li>
  <li>assessments we have carried out</li>
  <li>
    assessments from other members of staff such as previous class teachers or
    eatching assistants
  </li>
  <li>
    paperwork that may have been shared by the SENCo (also look on the shared
    area where info is often stored)
  </li>
  <li>
    the pupil themselves describing where they feel they experience difficulties
    but also explaining what they feel their relative strengths are
  </li>
  <li>
    views from parents (although this could come later on once you have more
    information and a clearer idea of the issues)
  </li>
</ul>
What is the issue? What are your concerns relating to the pupil, what is it that
you have noticed within the classroom? What behaviours are we seeing? We are looking
to gather evidence we are not looking to come up with a diagnosis – that might come
up in a subsequent assess, plan, do and review cycle and would be the carried out
by outside professionals.

<strong>Plan</strong>

Knowing what you feel the issue may be, the next step is considering what you need to do in order to help the pupil access the curriculum and engage with learning activities within the classroom.

Things we might do at the initial stage could be:

<ul>
  <li>Modelling tasks and making each step explicit for the pupil</li>
  <li>Having worksheets to look at rather than working from the board</li>
  <li>Giving pupils additional processing time</li>
  <li>Providing scaffolds to support writing or independent tasks</li>
</ul>
These plans need to be shared so that all staff adopt a consistent approach. For
some of you that might be talking with teaching assistants so that they complement
what you are doing.

<strong>Do</strong>

Putting into action what you have planned. Trying out different approaches and seeing their impact. Most importantly, doing something rather than waiting for someone else to take responsibility.

<strong>Review</strong>

What did you notice? What have other staff noticed?

What was the impact of specific approaches you used?

What worked and what didn’t work?

In what situation or context did the approach work / not work?

How did different approaches impact on the pupil accessing the curriculum and the progress they made?

What does the pupil feel about the different approaches used?

How does this information help us in having a clearer idea of where a pupil may be experiencing difficulties? What do we now know that we previously were not aware of? So with our newfound knowledge and understanding of the pupil, what would we do differently?

We can then start again but we now have more information at the assess stage because we have our findings from our first cycle. It may be the case that if difficulties persist then after our own initial cycle, we may then go through the cycle again and involve other stakeholders such as the SENCo, parents, pupil, other professionals more intensively.

The more we know about a pupil then the more we can do to support the pupil by making adjustments to our practices, give strategies to the pupil and help ensure that all staff adopt a consistent approach to working with the pupil.

When supporting pupils with additional learning needs, it’s important that you don’t feel alone. You have the right to support from other staff in your school such as your SENCo and/or members of the senior leadership team. As indicated in the [EEF’s guidance report (2020)](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Send/EEF_Special_Educational_Needs_in_Mainstream_Schools_Guidance_Report.pdf), support is most effective when a holistic approach is taken to assess, plan, do and review.

## The graduated approach: activity

Watch the video below to hear from Kelly Challis from the Driver Youth Trust, as she explains how she uses the graduated approach to adapt her learning environment and practice to support pupils with dyslexia.

Difficulties with reading and spelling not only create many challenges for those who have dyslexia<strong>,</strong> but also for those other young people who are quietly struggling with literacy difficulties in our education system without a diagnosis<strong>. </strong>

When using the graduated approach, I need to make sure there is movement around the four stages of action; these stages being assess, plan, do<strong>,</strong> and review. The information I collect helps me to understand the needs of pupils with literacy difficulties and dyslexia<strong>,</strong> and as a result I can put into place strategies to support these learners, working with them to make good progress and ultimately to secure good outcomes in their education.

In the <strong>‘assess’</strong> stage, I not only use summative and formative assessments, but I also take into consideration the views and experiences of the learner’s parents/carers, as well as the learner’s own view<strong>: what </strong>are they finding difficult, and <strong>why</strong>? It is important at this stage to discuss with the SENCo any standardised scores from educational psychology assessments to make sure I understand their meaning and application to my planning.

In order to teach according to each child’s educational needs as far as possible, it is essential to see them as a<em> whole</em> person, complete with individual strengths and weaknesses. The information I gather helps me personalise my teaching and address their specific needs.

In the <strong>‘plan’ </strong>stage of the graduated approach there are 2 areas which need to be considered. First of all, what can I include in my teaching to respond to my pupil with dyslexia’s identified needs? If they have a poor working memory, I must ensure I do not overload this, taking care not to give several instructions at a time. In addition, I need to plan mini-plenaries or Q&amp;As to refresh their memories and gauge their understanding. The SEND Code of Practice is clear that research informs us that the most impact on learner progress comes from the quality of teaching in the classroom (Education Endowment Fund).

The other area to plan for is targeted provision. Intervention forms an important part of assessment. For example, a learner with dyslexia may need a phonics intervention, an input of vocabulary, both every day and subject specific, or extra reading practice to develop fluency and comprehension. It is important that teachers work closely with teaching assistants or other staff to assess the impact of such targeted interventions and have clear entry and exit criteria.

The <strong>‘do’</strong> stage of the graduated approach puts my plans into action. The minor adaptations I can make to day-to-day practice and to the learning environment can, in turn, make a huge difference to those learners with literacy difficulties or dyslexia. An added bonus is that all learners will benefit from these changes.

So what do these changes mean for my learners? It means they can navigate texts with more ease and I can signpost without telling them the answers, it allows the learners to problem solve using my displays rather than raising their hand for me to help them. It means I am confident that the teaching I am delivering is pitched at a level that all learners can engage with.

Some of the adaptations and considerations I have made in my teaching to support my learners with literacy difficulties and dyslexia are:

<ul>
  <li>
    I make information on the white board is clear and uncluttered. I also
    number the start of each line or topic clearly.
  </li>
  <li>
    My displays around the classroom are informative and updated regularly. I
    explain and talk about what is in the displays<strong>, </strong>
    illustrating how they can be helpful and supportive.
  </li>
  <li>
    I consider the readability of worksheets, for example the layout, size and
    type of font. I tend to use Arial, 12 point, and avoid underlining by using
    boxes or bold. If learners are to write on the worksheet then{" "}
    <strong>I </strong>make sure they have enough space to write legibly.
  </li>
</ul>
These adaptations help learners to navigate texts with more ease and allows them
to problem solve using resources such as displays independently, rather than raising
their hand for me to help them.

At the <strong>‘review’</strong> stage, when looking at the impact of teaching a dyslexic learner, I cannot overstate the importance of listening to the views both of my learners and their parents or carers. Their input provides me with valuable insights and informs my subsequent planning.

The majority of my pupils with dyslexia will have their needs met through high quality teaching and<strong>,</strong> if necessary<strong>, </strong>targeted intervention. The responsibility of their progress lies with us, the class or subject teacher, and not with the SENCo or learning support department. As teachers, it is absolutely essential that we remain flexible and sensitive in all our teaching when working pupils with SEN.

### Adaptive teaching

5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.

5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.

5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

5.7 Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

_5d. Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively._

_5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations._

### Professional behaviours

This session will take **approximately 50 minutes** to complete.

## Session overview

Throughout your career, you are likely to teach pupils who require a greater level of support.

To support you to do this, in this session you will explore:

- Every teacher is a teacher of SEND
- Personalising support
- Education Health Care Plan
- How can research support you?
- Support from other stakeholders

## Every teacher is a teacher of SEND

> “Every teacher is a teacher of SEND.”

You may have heard this quote before; it is well known within the English education system. It comes from the SEND Code of Practice (2014), and it is a reminder that the class teacher is responsible and accountable for the progress and development of all pupils in their class.

However, if there is a pupil in your class who requires a greater level of support, feeling knowledgeable and confident enough to know how to support their development can be a worry for new teachers.

One of the contributing factors which leads to the feeling of being unprepared is the uniqueness of the individual pupil; children with the same diagnosed learning need may require very different support. That said, your knowledge and confidence will develop with experience as you progress through your career. You will add to your mental model of how to teach pupils who require a greater level of support, and your expertise will grow exponentially. While you are still at this early stage, it is essential that you seek support from colleagues and adhere closely to the advice of special education professionals. You are responsible for the progress and development of all your pupils, but this does not mean you are alone.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Think of a pupil that you have observed or taught that has one of the four areas
of needs explored last week:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Communication and interaction needs</strong> such as Asperger’s
    Syndrome
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cognition and learning needs</strong> such as dyslexia
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Social, emotional and mental health difficulties </strong>such as an
    attachment disorder
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sensory or physical needs </strong>such as visual impairment
  </li>
</ul>
Consider the following questions and record your response in your notebook:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How prepared do you currently feel to identify strategies that would
      support this pupil with their learning?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Who could you seek support from within your setting?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
You may wish to talk to your mentor more about this at your next mentor interaction.

## Personalising support

As mentioned in previous sessions, high-quality teaching is positioned as the foundation of all SEND provision. Section 6.37 of the Code of Practice clearly states:

> High-quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN. Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching.
>
> (DfE, 2015)

Access to high-quality teaching is the right of every pupil and building high-quality teaching strategies into your everyday practice should be the first step taken to support all pupils to succeed. Therefore, as an early career teacher, working to develop your understanding and application of effective teaching strategies will help you to meet most of your pupils’ individual needs without creating unnecessary workload.

You will use the cycle of assess, plan, do and review to support all your pupils. However, this process is likely to become more personalised as pupils’ needs increase, to ensure they receive the targeted and specialist support that they require to achieve meaningful success. It may be that pupils are given additional support through interventions. Where this is the case, it is important to remember that ‘interventions’ (particularly any that require a pupil to leave the classroom) should support the work that is being done in the classroom, and not replace it. As stated in the SEND Code of Practice:

> Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching
>
> (DfE, 2014)

### Seeking support

It is important to remember that you are not alone in working to overcome pupils’ barriers to learning. The SEND Code of Practice states:

> Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement. This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving, teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered.
>
> (DfE 2014)

Seeking advice and support from your colleagues and, the SENCo, will support your knowledge and understanding of SEN strategies and help your pupils to overcome any barriers to learning.

## Education Health Care Plan

Pupils who are deemed as needing ‘specialist provision’ would be eligible to access external agencies and services, such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy. Pupils who require specialist support are likely to include pupils with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).

Since 2015, pupils with SEND have been classified as either having an EHCP or requiring ‘SEN Support’. EHCPs are awarded by local authorities and set out the additional support a pupil requires for their needs to be met. SEN Support can be provided by the school or external agencies.

Although anyone can request that the local authority carry out an assessment on a child, in the school setting EHCPs are most often requested by the SENCo or a parent.

The number of pupils with an EHCP has increased over the last three years. It is therefore increasingly likely that you may teach a pupil with an EHCP in place, so what is the role of the teacher in the plan?

### Your role in the EHCP

Whether it is in preparation to apply for an EHCP, or whether a pupil has already been granted one, your role as a teacher is to provide information and evidence on the progress and needs of the pupil. The graduated approach will be a key tool in gathering this information and support you to assess the impact of the strategies that have been put in place.

There is an annual review of EHCP to determine the progress of the pupil, the effectiveness of the strategies, and whether the EHCP is still needed. If you teach a pupil with an EHCP, you will be asked to attend or contribute to the review meeting to provide valuable information about the developing needs of the pupil. Both the pupil and their parents or carers will also be invited to attend this meeting to share their views on how effective the current strategies are and any barriers that are present.

## How can research support you?

There is a wealth of research around SEN provision that could be used to support you to adapt your teaching practice and develop strategies to overcome barriers to learning. However, you must approach any research with a critical eye. A large amount of research focuses on interventions that worked in one setting yet may not be robust enough to be replicated in yours.

The strong turn towards evidence-informed practice over the last few years has meant that there is now a robust, peer-reviewed evidence base that helps us understand how children learn best and what this means for education. This broad evidence base highlights that there isn’t currently the same rigour in research around SEN provision. There are, however, significant efforts being made to rectify this.

A useful website to access is the [‘What Works?’](https://www.sendgateway.org.uk/whole-school-send/what-works/) SEND gateway, which is supported by NASEN (National Association for Special Educational Needs). The information and interventions on this site have been peer-reviewed and subjected to a panel process in order to be included. The resources are broken down into each of the four broad areas of need, and then further categorised into universal, targeted and specialist support.

The DfE has commissioned research into what effective practice in school looks like in order to develop understanding of how to improve outcomes for pupils with SEND. (Carroll et al, 2017). The report found some good quality evidence on effective interventions to support pupils’ cognition, mental health, communication and interaction needs. It also highlighted how important good assessment is to support teachers to correctly identify individual needs, and the importance of proper training for anyone who is delivering an intervention.

When looking at SEN interventions more broadly, there are common themes that emerge that seem to support positive outcomes:

- the effective deployment of a teaching assistant.
- the importance of engaging all stakeholders, especially parents.

In session 4, you looked at ways to work effectively with your teaching assistant. Let’s look at this in relation to SEN provision, as well as the importance of stakeholder relationships.

## Support from other stakeholders

A stakeholder in education is someone who has an interest in the success and welfare of the school and its pupils. Stakeholders include those who work in the school (e.g. teachers, support staff, governors and specialist services) and those outside (e.g. parents and doctors). The inclusion of stakeholders in the support network around a pupil can play a major part in the successful outcomes experienced by that pupil. The information, advice, and specialist guidance that some stakeholders can provide can change the entire nature of the support and provision given to a pupil.

However, it is often forgotten that the pupil themselves is the most important stakeholder. Their voice matters too, and they should be encouraged to share which approaches they feel are working. It is essential to gather the views of the pupil and their family if the graduated approach is to work effectively. It will help to build a more holistic picture of the pupil so that you become more aware of the needs of the individual across different contexts.

Hear from Kelly Challis from the Driver Youth Trust, as she explains how engaging with stakeholders can make a huge difference in your ability to support a pupil with SEND and make notes in your notebook.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The adaptations you make to your everyday class teaching can have a great
  impact on the progress of the pupil. For example:
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      ensuring key vocabulary is pre-taught can help ensure that learners are
      better prepared when they come across it in lessons 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Or providing scaffolding for the learner during tasks can mean that they
      don’t experience the fear of the blank page but have support to start
      their response 
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When adaptive teaching does not have the desired impact, suitable
  interventions should be set up. Interventions need to be effective and
  evidence based, and progress must be tracked and shared. In some instances,
  additional assessments may be needed and carried out by the SENCo or
  potentially other educational professionals. This assessment data needs to be
  clearly understood and shared with all appropriate stakeholders so next steps
  can be planned. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  A stakeholder in education is someone who has an interest in the success and
  welfare of a school and its pupils. This includes those who work in and
  outside the school, for example teachers, support staff, parents, governors
  and specialist services. Each of these people have an important role to play
  in supporting the pupil to make progress towards their individual goals. These
  goals may vary greatly, from being able to access elements of the curriculum,
  to feeling comfortable and safe in the classroom setting.  However, it is
  often forgotten that the young person with SEND is also an important
  stakeholder and their thoughts and feeling should be listened to and included
  in any plans. Pupil profiles can be useful in giving a learner the opportunity
  to make their voice heard. This can help school staff build relationships with
  them and understand things from their perspective. This information can also
  inform planning, classroom layout, timetabling and supports in order to enable
  learners to participate in all aspects of classroom learning.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  A graduated approach will help you to monitor the impact of stakeholder
  support on the development of the pupil. At each step of the way along the
  assess, plan, do, review cycle, consideration needs to be made as to which
  stakeholder needs what information, how it will be gathered, and how and when
  this information must be shared. There needs to be clear processes in place
  for when to work with specialists, both those within the school and
  externally. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Most importantly the learner and their family need to be at the centre of the
  whole process. It is essential to gather their views if the graduated approach
  is to work effectively. Involving the pupil and their family can help build a
  more holistic picture of the pupil so that you become more aware of the
  individual in different contexts. This insight can then become invaluable for
  working out what can work with the pupil.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  High quality teaching, a graduated approach for SEND, and clear communication
  channels will ensure schools are on the way to effectively meeting the needs
  of all their learners. However, if{" "}
</span>
<b>all</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  stakeholders work together and communicate clearly, there will be even a
  greater impact on young people with SEND, which will support them to achieve
  better outcomes and realise their true potential.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When working to support pupils with special needs or disabilities, we work
  with a variety of other stakeholders. During my time as a SENDCo I have worked
  with local GPs and specialised doctors and nurses form a variety of
  departments such as the child development centre. Regular external agencies I
  work with include the ear, nose and throat department, audiology team, cleft
  palate team, school nurses, ophthalmologists, autism assessment team, the
  visual impairment and hearing impairment team and speech and language
  therapists and language development workers.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It is imperative to engage with these services to ensure the pupils are able
  to access the correct provision and learning environments to enable them to
  succeed. For example, we have several pupils in the school who are hearing
  impaired. The hearing impairment team regularly visit the school to advise on
  top tips for those pupils in different lessons, from the lighting, seating
  position and correct use of radio aids. We are able to use the knowledge we
  have gained to help other pupils as soon as they begin to attend our school,
  to ensure the pupil is able to engage in all lessons as soon as they walk
  through the door.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Communication is key when working with other stakeholders. There may be times
  when you need to do a bit of detective work and knowing who to contact and
  having good relationships means a faster result for the child.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Including parents/carers, and the pupil themselves, in the process is key to
  being able to contact the right people. By having all the information from all
  the individuals involved in the pupil's life, you will be able to get a fully
  rounded picture of any support that needs to be in place, which will
  ultimately mean the pupil is able to progress in their education.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It is important to be aware that some parents/carers will have very little
  experience with the SEND process and external agencies. Likewise, they may
  have a wealth of knowledge that can be shared with and learned from. Regular
  meetings should be held with parents/carers to ensure knowledge and
  information can be gathered, as well as working together to ensure the child’s
  voice is included. An open-door policy will also help parents/carers in
  feeling empowered to approach staff with any information rather than waiting
  for time specified meetings.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Bill is 4 1/2 years old and has been deaf in the left ear from birth. He also
  has intermittent hearing loss in the right ear. Alongside this, he also been
  diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder which, for Bill, can present in
  different ways. He sometimes appears the same as any other child his age, but
  when overstimulated by the environment, or overtired and ‘triggered’, he can
  have shutdowns that sometimes look like seizures or periods of absences. He
  can become unresponsive, limp, slack mouthed, or demonstrates repetitive
  behaviours he is unaware of (like an arm or leg moving up and down). If not
  observed properly, these{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  come across as him being shy and uninterested, or occasionally it can present
  like a seizure, which can be very distressing. As it is quite unpredictable
  how he will react to different stimuli it can be difficult to understand
  Bill's needs, as they can differ from moment to moment.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The nursery Bill attends is well set up for children with hearing loss and
  sensory impairment – it is one of the reasons we selected it. This means that
  there are many strategies staff use through the day (such as signing or giving
  visual cues) that benefit all of the children, even if they haven't been
  identified as needing it. Because these strategies are in place, Bill is
  comfortable at nursery and tends to not have the bigger episodes of shut down
  while he is there. This has resulted in the nursery saying that they were
  happy that Bill would be able to slot right into his new school and not need
  extra support or adaptation made. As his parents, we felt this was optimistic
  to say the least, so I contacted the school where he will begin in September
  to discuss my concerns. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Bill's older brother attends this school already and so I was able to explain
  a little of our situation, knowing they had knowledge of us as a family. They
  were instantly very reassuring. They offered a meeting before the school
  applications had even closed, so that they could understand more about Bill
  and what his needs for transition might be. They explained that if Bill
  transitioned well, with no extra support, then that is wonderful. However, if
  we collectively felt that he may need some support, they would much rather be
  proactive and have plans in place rather than having to be reactionary nearer
  the time. They asked about what strategies the nursery uses that we feel helps
  Bill, and also what we do at home. We were able to share several strategies
  such as supporting his hearing loss by using Makaton. Bill is very familiar
  with the signs, and in a noisy classroom Makaton really help him to understand
  and process what is being asked. He often misses the beginning an ends of
  words, so using Makaton means he understand much better what is going on. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Bill is a completely different child when he recognises where he is, who he is
  with and what is going to happen. When things happen he isn't expecting, it
  can really be a struggle. He can also struggle to pick up new skills until he
  has been shown them many more times than some of his peers. He needs to be
  allowed to watch until he feels comfortable to join in. Therefore, strategies
  like visual timetables, cue cards for routines, and countdown timers to signal
  change overs, really help him prepare and process what he is being asked to
  do. The cue cards are especially good for supporting his memory of how to do
  something, or the sequence it needs to be done in. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Another strategy that was particularly effective was that the nursery assigns
  each day of the week a colour, feel, and smell to help the children to learn
  and process each of these gradually. It is a gentle introduction to new senses
  that has become part of the routine of his day. The next time he encounters
  them he won’t be so surprised by them, and this could avoid any sensory
  overload happening. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The school have said they will ask the nursery for the details of each of
  these and will be able to implement at least some of them very easily, without
  disruption or additional cost. They explained that some of these things
  already help a number of children in the school and they gave us the further
  suggestions of using weighted toys and knee pads for circle time. The
  understanding of these needs and the implication of these strategies will, I
  am positive, prove to be a great help to Bill. It felt wonderful that they had
  taken the time to listen to our concerns, and engage with us in discussing
  strategies that would support my son. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As his parents we couldn't feel happier about the approach the school have
  used. We feel completely relaxed about this transition and very much like any
  ideas or thoughts will be listened to. The difference between this and the
  feelings we have been left with from nursery at times is unquantifiable. The
  transition to school can be a scary enough time, but when your child has
  additional needs that aren't always obvious, and you think your worries,
  concerns and knowledge of your child are being ignored, it is even harder.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I taught a pupil who was diagnosed with Dyslexia and Obsessive-Compulsive
  Disorder with elements of Autism. Here, I needed to put the pupil and their
  needs at the centre of the Graduated Approach. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This included engaging with them in open conversations about which strategies
  worked well for them and which ones did not and discussing how they like to be
  approached in the lesson. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Once I had this information, I cross referenced it with other information that
  I had on the pupil, for example any information from multi-agency meetings,
  the SENCO, and previous information gathered from their parents. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Once I had done this, I approached and spoke to their parents myself to look
  into what had and what had not previously worked for their child. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Then I set about using a low-stakes testing method to find out where they were
  in relation to their peers – this is something I often use with my whole class
  as part of high-quality teaching. This represented the assess phase of the
  Graduated Approach. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  From here I could plan how to best support them over the following academic
  year by providing extra support to address key misconceptions or topics that
  were particularly difficult for the child. For example, as the pupil had
  difficulty understanding perceptual reasoning, when teaching shapes, angles
  and area, I knew they would require more concrete examples. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When reviewing the strategies, I spoke with the pupil regularly to see if my
  lessons were having an impact. I also looked at carefully selected data to
  measure if there was progress. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Including the pupil’s voice in this process meant that the pupil felt they
  could have an open conversation with me when things were not working for them.
  This helped to make the pupil feel safe and supported, which in turn led to
  emboldened confidence – the key ingredient to getting any pupil with
  additional needs to give your lesson a go.

A common theme running through all the videos is that of ‘clear communication’. Whether this be between parents, pupils or educational specialists, good communication is a key feature of successful stakeholder relationships and ultimately the success of the pupil.

  <li>
    <strong>
      Who could you communicate with within your present school about pupils
      with SEN?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>

## Case Studies

In the previous session, you were introduced to the graduated approach. You were then asked to consider a pupil in your class who had a barrier to learning and reflect on what you had already done to support them to overcome this barrier.

Below are several case studies of teachers who have used the graduated approach to support a pupil with SEND. The case studies are organised into the four broad areas of need. Select one video below to watch that you feel would be most beneficial to your practice.

The child I am going to talk about is a pupil with Autism. He joined our school in Nursery, just after his second birthday and by the time he entered my Reception classroom, he had an Educational Health Care Plan to support him. To ensure I effectively supported him with his learning when he transitioned from nursery to reception, I used the graduated approach.

<h4>Assess</h4>
During the assess phase, I started by trying to gain an understanding of the pupil
as an individual to understand what their learning needs might be. To do this I made
use of any available data - I spoke to the previous class teacher about how they
had supported him in Nursery, whether there had been any interventions, timetable
changes or any other resources used to support him. I looked through his EHCP to
identify what his targets were and spoke to the SENCO for further guidance on how
I could support him to achieve these targets through adaptive teaching.
<h4>Plan</h4>
From the assess phase, it became apparent that the pupil struggled with different
sensory experiences and became discomforted when touching different textures. Therefore,
during the planning stage, I focused on planning for strategies that would support
and develop his ability to cope with different sensory experiences. After speaking
with the SENDCo, I planned to provide the pupil with 3 different activities each
week to work towards his sensory targets. The activities I planned for him to do
were touching rainbow slime, painting using his fingers and playing with farm animals
that were in a tray of foam.
<h4>Do</h4>
To implement these activities in the classroom, I put the activities in what we call
his ‘challenge box’. This is a tray in the classroom that is set up just for him.
In the tray, there was one activity for him to access at a time. These activities
were sometimes carried out with me, and sometimes with his 1:1 learning support assistant,
although, he was encouraged to access and complete these activities independently.
Once he completed one activity, it was replaced with a different one. He was encouraged
to complete the three activities several times over the course of the week.
<h4>Review</h4>
During the review phase, I met with other stakeholders to discuss the progress the
pupil has made. In our school. We do the ‘review’ element at the end of each term
to see how the pupil has developed, which helps to inform their next steps. The pupil
met his targets, so we used any new data we had to begin the cycle again and set
new ones.

The process of assess, plan, do, review, is continually used to shape the support around the changing needs of the pupil as they progress throughout the year and their school journey. It has helped him to make good progress towards his targets and his confidence to touch new objects in the classroom and at home is has grown. He says he feels happy in school and this is reflected in his behaviour.

This pupil was in Year 3 and their barrier to learning was reading. They had not passed the phonics screening check in Year 1 but had passed in Year 2. Their attainment was below age-related expectations but not significant enough for a specific SEND diagnosis. So although this pupil was making some progress, it was reading that continued to be the challenge. I used the graduated approach to identify the pupils needs, generate strategies to support them and evaluate these strategies based on the pupil’s progress.

During the assess phase I gathered as much information as possible. Through the progress, meetings teachers had identified that the child had a 2.3 score for reading, which was significantly behind for their age. As a result, further professional discussions about the pupil’s specific barriers to reading were required.

We also met with parents to discuss further support, and an in-depth gap analysis was carried out by English lead to support the teacher with next steps in the pupil’s learning. This analysis identified that whilst decoding was not an issue the pupil was not reading for meaning. That although they could confidently segment and blend, they were not making meaning from reading in sentences.

During the plan phase, the teacher used the information obtained from assessments and parents to decide what actions to take place. It was identified that the pupil would need support and interventions help them decode unfamiliar words using segmenting and blending. They would also need support to develop their comprehension of what they were reading.

To support the pupil to meet their decided outcomes, specific interventions were put in place such as:

<ul>
  <li>
    Reading to an adult every day with a specific focus on segmenting and
    blending unfamiliar words
  </li>
  <li>
    Receiving a reading intervention that focused on the pupil's ability to
    develop comprehension strategies such as re-reading sentences if they don’t
    seem to make sense
  </li>
  <li>
    Teacher providing focused support in the lessons such as working with the
    pupil in a guided group at least once a week
  </li>
  <li>
    Lesson visits from an SLT member to engage the pupil in discussions and
    promote a love of reading and book choices
  </li>
  <li>
    Reading strategies were shared with his parents and it was asked that he
    read to them daily
  </li>
</ul>
During the review phase. We identified that the impact of this support on the pupil
was positive. The pupil had become more confident at reading, the parents were more
engaged in the child’s learning and the gap between the child’s ability and age-related
reading expectations had narrowed.

The cycle of the graduated approach continues, the pupil is tracked through assessment (RAG), their needs are met though carefully tailored intervention and teaching following the RAG and there is ongoing monitoring from SLT through daily lesson visits, pupil voice and tracking. The regular review of their progress is allowing us to shift the support to meet their changing needs.

$EndSummary
$Content
Peter is in Year 9. He does not have a specific diagnosis. However, he has a significant delay in his cognitive (thinking skills/thought processes) ability and this translates as a major barrier to his learning on a daily basis. Peter learns at a significantly slower pace than his peers, despite robust quality first teaching. As such, he requires interventions, above and beyond that which is provided to his peers.

The barriers Peter faces with his cognition and learning difficulties encompass the entire curriculum, including literacy and numeracy delay, difficulties with his working memory and his processing ability is impaired. Specifically, Peter struggles with the speed in which he can process information, difficulties with manipulating information using his working memory and global barriers relating to his literacy delays. It means in real terms accessing any part of the curriculum can be difficult for Peter.

Secondary to this, Peter often demonstrates associated issues with lacking engagement, attention and concentration and his frustrations with his difficulties often manifest themselves in behavioural concerns.

Peter continues to face challenges in his learning, despite receiving high-quality teaching, as a result he requires additional strategies, or different provision, in order to meet his needs.

Assess - using the graduated approach, judgements need to be made using all of the data we hold on that particular pupil. For Peter the data pointed to there being significant difficulties faced by Peter whenever language was the barrier to his learning. That means the language barrier needs to be addressed even in subjects like maths, where the barrier needs to be removed to allow him to ‘see’ the maths.

Judgements about the progress Peter makes alert you to any barriers that may be getting in the way of them making comparable progress to their peers. At this stage Peter was referred, via the SENDCo, to the educational psychologist for further investigation as the gap between the progress he was making continued to widen, despite receiving interventions such as the Accelerated Reading programme and having some literacy-focused in-class support from a teaching assistant.

Plan - This part of the cycle involves discussing, planning and agreeing what will be put in place as an outcome of the assessment information gathered. The planning should involve the pupil, parents and staff from the school who know the pupil well. Where other professionals are working with the child, they should also contribute to planning. The initial step of the planning process includes agreeing targets for the pupil in order to focus attention on key areas and give them a clear idea of what they need to do to improve their work. Personalised support was planned for Peter to address his identified outcomes; specific teaching strategies were communicated to his teachers via his Learning Plan outlining the approaches and resources that must be used in his lessons to meet his needs. At this stage these included:

<ul>
  <li>
    Teaching material in small chunks and providing memory joggers and visual
    checklists
  </li>
  <li>Providing additional scaffolding/word banks for extended writing</li>
  <li>Pre-teaching of new vocabulary</li>
  <li>Using a laptop for extended writing tasks</li>
  <li>Using a multi-sensory approach to literacy</li>
</ul>
Do - The Code of Practice makes it clear that it is the responsibility of class and
subject teachers to implement the plan on a day-to-day basis.

Review - A timescale for reviewing the plan, and details of how progress will be monitored, also needs to be identified. When the review meeting between the pupil, parents and any relevant professionals takes place, it is helpful to consider the following questions:

<ul>
  <li>
    What progress has the pupil made? Have they achieved their agreed targets
    and what is the evidence for this?
  </li>
  <li>What impact has the support/intervention had on progress?</li>
  <li>
    What are the pupil’s, parents’ and professionals’ views on the
    support/intervention?
  </li>
  <li>What changes need to be made to targets or provision next term?</li>
</ul>
The assess, plan, do, review process is a cycle – the idea being that this process
is continual. If the review shows a pupil has made really good progress, this may
mean they no longer require the additional provision made through SEN support. If
this is the case, the pupil is likely to be taken off the SEN record and, instead,
will be monitored to ensure progress is sustained through inclusive high-quality
teaching. This is a continual process unless the pupil narrows the progress gap between
them and their peers sufficiently. $EndContent $EndAccordion

This case study describes how we have used the Graduated Approach to support a pupil – referred to as Pupil A throughout this video - with communication and interaction needs. The system follows the four stages, often referred to as a 'cycle': Assess, Plan, Do, Review. (For further information about this cycle, often referred to as the 'graduated approach', see Chapter 6 of the SEND Code of Practice 2015.)

Pupil A is a 4 year old, Asian, summer born boy, who started his Reception year after having a limited time spent in an education setting, from our feeder Nursery School. The pupil is also a second language learner, speaking ‘inko’ at home. Pupil A does not have any diagnosis of specific language impairment (SLI) at this stage. His non-verbal skills are a relative strength. He displays signs of phonological disorder with features of verbal dyspraxia which means he makes pronunciation errors, but again no diagnosis as his attendance was poor at nursery. Pupil A also has a hearing impairment and is involved with the hearing specialist teacher who supports with radio aids. He does not wear his hearing aids at home which is impacting on his hearing loss. These concerns are severely impacting on his ability to make himself understood. He doesn’t have an EHCP at present, but concerns were raised by the SENDCo at the previous setting.

<h4>Assess</h4>
As the class teacher, I worked closely with the SENDCo to discuss Pupil A’s needs
and created a baseline assessment by which progress will be measured. One of the
significant issues we faced was parental engagement with learning at home which became
clear through, for example non-engagement with home learning tasks, reading at home
and attendance at meetings. A review of hearing aid use at home was also completed
by the hearing impairment specialist which revealed the lack of use of hearing aids
at home, this revealed that Pupil A, therefore had a severely limited exposure to
language and which was impacting on the amount of progress he was making – which
was limited. A sharing meeting was held between myself, parents, SENDCO and the Hearing
Impairment Specialist to discuss all of the issues outlined above. In this meeting,
we also found that his parents felt Pupil A could speak in complex sentences in his
home language so our commissioned Speech and Language therapist arranged for a language
assessment in his home language.
<h4>Plan</h4>
The speech and language assessment provided a thorough assessment in Pupil A’s home
language and showed that he was significantly below in his home and second language.
Parents needed support in accepting that he had additional needs, even though mum
had started comparing him to her 2-year-old. A plan of additional support was drawn
up for him where both staff and parents agreed what outcomes they hoped would be
made, and by what date. For example, one outcome was for him to be able to recall
a number of nouns for common objects e.g. television, banana etc. by the next review
date. A record of this plan was kept in the school and one was sent home.
<h4>Do</h4>
Pupil A was given extra support. Some of the interventions that were put in place
were adaptations to my classroom practise whilst others were interventions carried
out by specialists. We also involved his parents in this stage of the process. Some
examples of the adaptations to practice made were:
<ul>
  <li>Using a visual timetable to support with routines.</li>
  <li>
    Pre-teaching of topics before it was introduced to the rest of the class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allocating a quiet space with the support of the hearing impairment
    specialist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Providing daily Time to Talk interventions with a small group of children.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Commissioned Speech and Language therapist focussed on Blank Level 1-2
    questioning and quieter speech sounds such as ‘sh’, ‘ch’, ‘th’ and ‘r.’
  </li>
  <li>Asking parents to practise basic words with him</li>
  <li>
    Asking his parents to ensure he wears his hearing aid at home and making
    them aware that this would be monitored.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each half term, the hearing impairment specialist scheduled home visits to
    check the frequency of the use of hearing aids at home
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Review</h4>I as class teacher attended half-termly meetings with the team
around the child including the SENDCo, Hearing Impairment Specialist, Speech and
Language Therapist and parents. Here we reviewed his targets and quickly
identified that Pupil A was struggling to make progress. In particular, he found
it challenging to retain information. As an outcome of the meeting, it was
agreed that the SENDCo, with the support of the class teacher writing a
description of the needs of Pupil A, would engage the community paediatrician in
order to enable us to explore any further underlying issues.
<h3>
  <strong>The Graduated Approach – The Second Cycle</strong>
</h3>
During the review stage of the first cycle, it was found that Pupil A was not
meeting his outcomes, so a second cycle began which included a more detailed
assessment which led to an even more personalised plan to support Pupil A.
<h4>Assess</h4>
Through the involvement of the paediatrician, the Early Support Monitoring
Protocol for Deaf Babies and Children (ESMP) was used to assess his development.
This indicated that Pupil A, who was 4 years and 9 months old at the time,
experienced a significant cognitive delay and was at a level development of a
child between 15 and 18 months of age.
<h4>Plan</h4>
During the second plan phase, it was recommended that Pupil A was offset and so
he could repeat his Reception year. The reasons why this was necessary were
clearly explained to his parents and they supported this decision too. New
outcomes were decided upon and the cycle continued.
<h4>Do</h4>
Using the graduated approach helped to identify Pupil A’s significant needs.
The <strong>Assess, Plan, Do, Review</strong> cycle needs to be fluid and
flexible to ensure both the teacher and school can respond to pupils needs. By
keeping him back a year, we were able to help him meet new outcomes. Several of
the interventions included in the initial ‘Do’ phase continued into the second
cycle.
<h4>Review</h4>
Although Pupil A’s attainment remained behind his peers, his progress became
much more rapid and sustained over time. The <strong>
  Assess, Plan, Do, Review
</strong> cycle is continually used as Pupil A moves through school to ensure
the provision in place supports his evolving needs as identified on his EHCP
which was gained during Pupil A’s offset year in Reception. $EndContent

Speech and language case study - Secondary

By Helen Bownes

Mikey is a Y11 pupil. He has historically had significant delays in his speech and language acquisition. He attended an additionally resourced primary provision for speech, language and communication difficulties. He was deemed appropriate however for attendance at mainstream school with enhanced provision. He is currently a year behind his chronological age due to the fact that his progress was hindered by his complex difficulties. He no longer requires speech and language therapy. His speech however can still be difficult to understand for the unfamiliar listener.

In terms of barriers, Mikey’s difficulties with all aspects of language have resulted in him having difficulties with his cognition and learning that relates to literacy. He also finds it difficult to maintain his attention and concentration for sustained periods of time, especially when a task is challenging. There are also some elements of social communication and interaction that Mikey finds problematic on a daily basis.

Mikey continues to face challenges in his learning, despite receiving high-quality teaching, as a result he requires additional strategies, or different provision, in order to meet his needs. Mikey is very resilient and determined, he embraces all interventions put in place and support offered to him. His family are valued stakeholders in the entire process. They are realistic, supportive and provide endless encouragement from home. There are now currently no other external agencies involved in the provision for Mikey, although this may change as he transitions into his post 16 pathway.

Assess - using the graduated approach judgements need to be made using all of the data we hold on that particular pupil. For Mikey the data pointed to there being significant difficulties faced by him whenever language was the barrier to his learning. That means the language barrier needs to be addressed even in subjects like maths, where the barrier needs to be removed to allow him to ‘see’ the maths. By doing this it enables Mikey to experience success in areas that he is more accomplished at, once his primary barrier is removed. Mikey also felt when he chose his key stage 4 pathway that he wanted to complete more vocational courses and steer away from modern foreign languages, as he felt he would struggle to overcome the barrier of the speaking component.

Judgements about the progress Mikey makes alerts you to any barriers that may be getting in the way of him making comparable progress to their peers. As Mikey started key stage 4, there was a shift to where the support was placed. There was an emphasis on teaching assistants in the core subjects, and the deployment of staff was shifted. Mikey had previously been reliant on ‘velcro’ style of support, the need was to focus on him utilise more of a model of support that allowed him to develop the skills to become more independent and to support him in getting himself out of the learning pit where he previously might have been reliant on an adult. The heavy use of collaborative learning combined nicely with this shift in support. There was an overwhelming improvement in Mike’s ability to discuss topics and be involved in working with others, as a result.

Plan - This part of the cycle involves discussing, planning and agreeing what will be put in place as an outcome of the assessment information gathered. The planning should involve the pupil, parents and staff from the school who know the pupil well. Where other professionals are working with the child, they should also contribute to planning. The initial step of the planning process includes agreeing targets for the pupil in order to focus attention on key areas and give them a clear idea of what they need to do to improve their work. In Mikey’s case there was an abundance of previous strategies and interventions which continue to support him fully in accessing mainstream educational provision.

Following this, personalised support was implemented for Mikey to address his identified outcomes, specific teaching strategies were communicated to his teachers via his Learning Plan outlining the approaches and resources that must be used in his lessons to meet his needs. At this stage these included:

<ul>
  <li>Pre-teaching of new vocabulary</li>
  <li>Using of a laptop for extended writing tasks</li>
  <li>Using social stories to support social interaction</li>
  <li>Carefully planning when to work collaboratively</li>
  <li>
    Developing strategies to support independence and self-help when struggling
    with tasks
  </li>
  <li>Providing scaffolding and/or word banks for extended writing</li>
  <li>Providing visual cues and memory</li>
</ul>
Do - The Code of Practice makes it clear that it is the responsibility of class and
subject teachers to implement the plan on a day-to-day basis.

Review - A timescale for reviewing the plan, and details of how progress will be monitored, also needs to be identified. When the review meeting between the pupil, parents and any relevant professionals takes place, it is helpful to consider the following questions:

<ul>
  <li>
    What progress has the pupil made? Have they achieved their agreed targets
    and what is the evidence for this?
  </li>
  <li>What impact has the support/intervention had on progress?</li>
  <li>
    What are the pupil’s, parents’ and professionals’ views on the
    support/intervention?
  </li>
  <li>What changes need to be made to targets or provision next term?</li>
</ul>
The assess, plan, do, review process is a cycle – the idea being that this process
is continual. If the review shows a pupil has made really good progress, this may
mean they no longer require the additional provision made through SEN support. If
this is the case, the pupil is likely to be taken off the SEN record and, instead,
will be monitored to ensure progress is sustained through inclusive high-quality
teaching. This is a continual process unless the pupil narrows the progress gap between
them and their peers sufficiently. $EndContent $EndAccordion

Attachment and hypervigilence case study

$Summary

$EndSummary
$Content
I taught a pupil who was diagnosed with an attachment disorder and hypervigilance. Along with some learning difficulties, this pupil also presented with some very challenging behaviour. They were impulsive and at times highly aggressive with limited empathy, and as the years went on, they found it more difficult to retain close friendships because of this. The pupil lacked confidence in themselves and would often be low in mood and self-deprecating about their abilities. They were also hyperactive in class, very restless, and did find it difficult to concentrate for long periods of time.

The levels of support around this pupil were highly personalised and the graduated approach was something I utilised to monitor progress carefully and support us in our judgements as to whether our strategies were having an impact.

<h4>Assess</h4>
Before this pupil entered my class, to support with my assessments, they actually
visited my classroom several times with their then current teacher. They took part
in some of my lessons, got to know where things were in the room, where their peg
and draw would be. I took this opportunity to chat with them and find out more about
them. I found out that they loved Maths, football, and wrote rap songs. I knew that
this pupil had a great relationship with their current teacher, so their teacher
and I spoke a lot about how they had developed this and general strategies that were
working well. This pupil had been working with the CAMHS team, including an educational
psychologist, so I made sure I read the reports from them and knew what recommendations
had been given for supporting with learning and behaviour. I had taught this child’s
sibling the previous year, so I did already have a relationship with the family.
If I didn’t have this relationship already established, I would have spoken to them
very early in the year about what they have found effective and established some
norms around how were going to communicate. Attachment disorder or hypervigilance
weren’t things I knew too much about at the time, so I also did a lot of reading
and finding of strategies on my own, as well as talking to the SENCo about what was
working well in school.
<h4>Plan</h4>
The first question we would ask ourselves as we planned out any strategy or intervention
was always ‘will this pupil feel safe in this situation?’ This didn’t mean that I
as a teacher, or we as a school, were putting them in a dangerous situation, more
that if the pupil perceived something to be out of the normal routine without prior
warning, they would have a heightened sense of awareness that would make them feel
very anxious. Other situations that would lead to them feel anxious or unsafe were
if the corridor was too busy, or if there was a supply teacher needed, or if we did
maths before breaktime – anything that was unexpected could lead to heightened anxiety
levels. If this happened, it was unlikely that they would be calm enough to participate
fully in their learning, and there was also a risk that these feelings of fear and
uncertainty would manifest into challenging behaviours. So to counteract this we
planned strategies that would allow them to be as prepared as possible about what
was happening, or what they needed to do. Strategies in the plan were things like
visual timetables, me giving clear explanations, writing instructions down for them,
support with transitioning between the classroom and the playground from a TA, class
countdown timers to support focus, and reward charts to praise good behaviour
<h4>Do</h4>
Along with the strategies that I planned, I stuck to my routines for the day very
tightly, I would share what was happening in the day using a visual timetable and
if anything was going to deviate from that I would speak to this pupil to prepare
them so that it didn’t leave them feeling uncertain. I also had to be very consistent
with my expectations around behaviour and I had to follow through on any consequences.
Me being very consistent meant that I was predictable in my behaviour and this pupil
felt a level of comfort and trust around that. Having clear behavioural boundaries
meant that if they were ever crossed, they knew what consequences to expect, so this
stopped the pupil from entering ‘fight or flight’ mode and any challenging behaviour
escalating. Genuine and specific praise was also something that was very important
for supporting with their self-image – which is something we worked hard to improve.
They liked to know specifically what they had done that was good, and they thrived
on being able to show other teachers good work or me calling home with positive news.
We also set up a routine whereby once a week the pupil would support children in
the younger year groups in their maths lesson. This was to try and encourage self-confidence,
but also to promote and reward calm and patient behaviour - which they needed to
exhibit when working with the younger pupils. They were also very into comedy and
we would have ‘joke of the week’, which they would tell to the class and then the
staffroom over lunch. Feeling like others didn’t like them, or feeling frustration
from their peers was something that upset them very much, so this appreciation of
their talents and making their peers laugh was something they really enjoyed and
made them feel good.
<h4>Review</h4>
The strategies we put in place to support the pupil’s self-image and behaviour were
generally effective. If they ever weren’t, it was quick to identify, as their behaviour
would become challenging. It meant that I was very responsive as a teacher. The work
the pupil did with the younger children in Maths was particularly effective at improving
their self-image, and they took a great deal of pride in preparing resources to take
with them to classroom to help demonstrate something. They also loved being someone
the younger children could come and talk to on the playground.

We had termly reviews with the Ed psych, and we would discuss progress towards the emotional and behavioural goals we had set. Although their parents were at times difficult to engage, I would call home or grab them at the end of the day to give positive news. With the support of the ed pysch, we also adapted the reward chart so that it could also be utilised at home.

I taught this pupil for two years and learnt a lot about them and also my own practice. My biggest learning was around the importance of getting to know the pupil and understanding their needs and what lies behind their challenging behaviour. If a child has a social, emotional and mental health need, they may need their self-confidence and self-image boosted in order to support academic progress.

### Adaptive teaching

5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.

5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.

5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.

5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

5.6 There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.

5.7 Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

_5a. Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down._

_5c. Working closely with the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) and special education professionals and the Designated Safeguarding Lead._

_5d. Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively._

_5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations._

_5g. Making effective use of teaching assistants._

### Professional behaviours

8.5 Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.

8.6 SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.

_8g. Seeking ways to support individual colleagues and working as part of a team._

_8h. Communicating with parents and carers proactively and making effective use of parents’ evenings to engage parents and carers in their children’s schooling._

_8n. Understanding the right to support (e.g. to deal with misbehaviour)._

This session will take **approximately 25 minutes** to complete.

## Overview

This session will focus on:

- What is the purpose of a curriculum?
- How to capitalise on existing resources

## What is the purpose of a curriculum?

At a national level, the purpose of a curriculum is to set out an entitlement for all pupils to the knowledge and learning that our society determines is the most powerful and important for a well-rounded education. As we move to think about curriculum at a school and classroom level, a curriculum provides coherence (how the content, assessment, pedagogy and teaching materials align and reinforce each other). This is important because when curriculum lacks coherence, it is both harder to teach and harder for children to locate and place their new knowledge (Myatt, 2018). Only a well-designed curriculum enables successful learning.

In order to understand your role in curriculum design, let us look at the differences between the National Curriculum and the curriculum at a school and classroom level more closely. The National Curriculum provides programmes of study and attainment targets for each national curriculum subject, setting out the knowledge and skills to be taught at each key stage. A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the National Curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning. At the classroom level, the curriculum will also include pedagogy (how the curriculum will be taught) and how pupils will be assessed.

$I
A roadmap is a helpful metaphor when thinking about designing a curriculum: a roadmap shows the destination (the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the content to be taught) and the route to get there (the teaching practices most likely to lead to successful learning). When good schemes of work are in place, they can therefore reduce teacher workload and give teachers autonomy to adjust the ‘route’ as the scheme unfolds, lesson by lesson (Myatt 2018).

So for schools I think a curriculum allows them to sequence and organize the knowledge that they want pupils to develop, and the skills they want people to develop over their time in the school, so it would include clarifying the order in which that should happen and also the content itself so what it is they want pupils to learn and what skills they want pupils to develop and to what level.

For teachers a curriculum allows, allows them to be clear about the knowledge and the ordering and the sequencing with which they want pupils to acquire that knowledge and the way that they're going to demonstrate the particular skills of that subject and it helps them to prioritise because within a subject there's so much that can be taught but to prioritise what each people needs and to make sure that they're building on what pupils have learned in the past.

As someone who's kind of studied the subject at university or at A level we, you've, developed a picture, a kind of a schema, a way of organizing your knowledge of that subject and so when you learn something new you learn it in the context of other things that you've previously learned and that's what we're trying to help pupils to do while they're at school, to build these schema these pictures of a subject in their heads and a curriculum is what helps children to develop that schema and helps them to organise their learning and so that they can see how the way the Shang dynasty fell is connected to the fall of the Roman empire and then when an empire gets particularly big it becomes harder to keep it kind of under control and that ability to organize knowledge and to organize ideas is what pupils I think can get from a well-planned curriculum.

So a high-quality curriculum has been carefully thought about and it's been carefully designed to be rigorous so it's challenging and it asks pupils to develop really complex and challenging ideas and then importantly it's been really carefully sequenced and so the ordering of how pupils will learn and what they will learn at different times has been thought about and there are connections made across time and space so that a year three curriculum builds on what pupils will have learnt in year two and ensures that that is growing their schema and their picture of the subject.

## Choosing the topic of your scheme of work

Before we go any further, the first thing you need to do is to decide what your scheme of work will be about.

It makes sense for you to select a topic you will be teaching this or next academic year, so that you can teach it. This will also give you the added benefit of being able to review and revise your scheme based on how it goes.

Given we’re already in the Summer term, this might mean thinking ahead to the pupils and topics you will be teaching next year. If you’re not sure about what topic to pick, talk to your mentor before moving onto the next session.

## Capitalise on existing resources

When designing your scheme of work, don’t feel that you need to start everything from scratch. You will not be the first teacher (nor the last!) to go through this thinking and planning process, so make the most of building on what others have done before you.

Draw on the expertise of your colleagues and wider professional networks and seek out many of the high-quality resources that exist online. Not only will this reduce your workload, it will also enable you to connect with and learn from your colleagues and the wider teaching profession.

Colleagues in your department or phase - and in your wider professional networks - are likely to have a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and practice activities that they can share with you.

However, keep in mind is that your decisions about what resources to use, should be driven by the needs of the curriculum (i.e. the concepts, knowledge and skills that pupils need to learn). What can be tempting but should be avoided, is using a resource that you think looks great and distorting your scheme to fit it in. Using resources aligned with the school curriculum (e.g. textbooks or shared resources designed by experienced colleagues) will help you to develop a scheme of work that is coherent and well sequenced.

As you’re no doubt already aware, there is also an abundance of teaching and learning resources available online. This can feel overwhelming, especially as not all these resources are of a high quality. Following the recommendations of experienced colleagues is a good place to start.

$CTA
Below are some questions which you could ask yourself when looking through available resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Does the resource align with the school curriculum?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Does the resource focus on the essential concepts and/or knowledge and/or
      principles of the subject?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      If the resource or material is related to a pupil activity, does it ensure
      pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject you want
      pupils to learn?
    </strong>

When planning a scheme of work, it is important to do as much research as possible, making use of materials from subject specialists with more experience in the topic, so that we can be sure we are delivering material of the highest calibre to our pupils. Even though I studied geography at university and studied volcanology specifically in my final year, there were still elements that I researched again to make sure I really was teaching accurate information and providing the most helpful maps, diagrams and graphs. For example, for a long time teachers in secondary school have taught that convection currents in the mantle move the tectonic plates. But we now know that this is not entirely true and that actually gravity and the weight of the plates are fundamental to their movement. I wanted to make sure this information, which is taught in the A Level curriculum, was present in the Year 7 unit, because it makes it easier for pupils to understand, and also because I want my pupils to have geographically accurate knowledge.

And despite having taught Plate Tectonics at all levels, there were new illustrations that I came across from speaking to colleagues and observing colleagues teach, that I was able to incorporate to the scheme to support pupils in grasping some of these really complex ideas. So, to help teach the concept about gravity and the weight of the tectonic plate causing movement, I observed a colleague demonstrate to her class how a necklace with a heavy pendant on it, when hanging off of the table, slowly edges further towards the floor, which is great illustration to help the pupils understand how gravity acts on heavy materials.

We don’t want to reinvent the wheel and there are lots of great materials about. I incorporated lots of materials I had successfully used previously to teach the scheme. However, I also added in new materials from well researched and reputable sources, to add rigour to the unit. And then having another subject specialist check over the unit and give their insight meant I was able to make revisions to the scheme which made it more robust. Time invested into the scheme’s planning pays dividends later on.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  There are many different approaches to how the ‘curriculum’ is delivered in
  EYFS, with some settings providing all pre-planned adult directed learning
  opportunities and others following a free more ‘in-the moment’ approach (see
  Anna Ephgrave for more information on this). Personally, I try to use a
  mixture of both, taking lots of opportunities to follow pupils lead and
  empower them to run the play whilst setting out key new learning
  opportunities. It is hard to separate the curriculum between those discrete
  whole class learning opportunities and the ‘activity’ time when pupils are
  learning through play. I find the design of each are quite different.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This series of lessons focus around the Ghanaian traditional tale, “The
  Leopard’s Drum.” Due to the holistic nature of the EYFS you will find elements
  across the curriculum evident in the provision planning, but the adult input
  sessions around this theme were predominantly English based. When planning any
  unit of work, it is important to ensure that you have accurate information and
  knowledge around the topic and try to make use of specialists where you can,
  whether that be colleagues, parents or the pupils themselves. In the context
  of this series of lessons I was able to reach out to parents of two children
  in my class who were able to offer support in terms of their personal
  experiences of Ghana. Firstly, they supported with correct pronunciation of
  the characters in the text as well as supporting their children to prepare
  presentations on both Ghanaian food and dress. This not only supported the
  crucial link between home and school but empowered these students to take more
  of a lead in their learning. These sessions provided a great hook and made the
  otherwise slightly abstract concepts more tangible to the class as a whole.
  There are many resources out there to help with creating lesson plans and
  ‘activity’ ideas from Pintrest and Facebook groups to Twinkl and TES. Whilst
  these are all useful sources of ideas I often find them a bit overwhelming.
  It’s hard to avoid getting swept up in the fun activity ideas, “Can you create
  an elephant from a paper plate?” instead of focusing on the learning
  objectives and curriculum, “manipulates materials to achieve a planned
  effect.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Before I start each new text, I take some time to look at the vocabulary that
  is being used, see if there are any new concepts or any opportunities to
  change the text slightly to provide a more interesting synonym. I find this
  works particularly well when doing a Talk 4 Writing project (see Pie Corbett
  for more on this). We need to have high expectations of our pupils; and ensure
  we are teaching them the correct vocabulary and facts surrounding their
  learning. Young children often learn misconceptions or inaccurate information
  that they have to then re-learn in later life, something which is much harder
  to do. In the context of this series of work it was a great opportunity to
  teach a wider range of vocabulary such as, “huge,{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">magnificent</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  drum.  We know that the vocabulary gap is significant between children from
  disadvantaged backgrounds and their more affluent peers (see Alex Quigley for
  more on this) so, as educators I think we need to do as much as we can to
  empower young children with a wide range of lexicon. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  However, we do not need to reinvent the wheel and do everything from scratch.
  Once you are aware of your core text and have thought about where the gaps are
  in your cohort’s learning. Do they need more opportunities to develop their
  fine motor development? Or perhaps they need a bit of extra support in their
  self-confidence so you need to incorporate more public speaking opportunities;
  then plan backwards from these gaps to look at the resources out there that
  can help you to create these learning outcomes.
</span>

**The key take-away here is: don’t reinvent the wheel.**

As you work through this module, seek out existing resources from colleagues, professional networks, and online.

Keep asking yourself:

- **Which of my colleagues might have resources they can share with me on this?**
- **Are there any other colleagues in my school or wider professional network who could support me with this?**
- **What resources do my school or multi-academy trust have access to that could be useful here?**
- **Which websites might have high-quality resources I could adopt and adapt for this scheme of work?**

## Overview

Once you have selected the topic for your scheme of work, the next step is to identify the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject that you want pupils to learn.

This session will focus on:

- Identifying the essential concepts, knowledge and skills
- Foundational concepts and knowledge
- Vocabulary

## Identifying essential concepts, knowledge and skills

In module 2 you were introduced to the idea that pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models and that carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

Therefore, think about where this scheme of work is situated in your subject or school curriculum and consider how the knowledge in this scheme will fit in to this longer-term sequencing.

Identifying the knowledge that you want all your pupils to learn and remember, will also help you to consider the amount of teaching, practice and retrieval that you need to build into your scheme of work.

  When planning curriculum, I believe it is crucial for us to plan based on the
  only safe assumption we have about pupils and their relationship with our
  subject, and that is that they might go on to study it at university. I think
  this mentality completely changes the way we plan curriculum as we have to
  think much more carefully about the rigour, longevity and flexibility of what
  we are teaching.

  I am going to be talking about a Year 7 Plate Tectonics scheme of work that I
  wrote recently, that brings together years of teaching the scheme in various
  formats and timeframes. The scheme is an exciting one for introducing
  geography in secondary school and precedes another physical geography topic
  that is more technical, meaning that pupils are better prepared for this
  second topic due to the foundational concepts, knowledge and skills set up in
  the Plate Tectonics scheme. Starting with this topic also means that pupils
  can engage with issues surrounding development and poverty in a more
  sophisticated way later on in school, once they have a grounding in how
  tectonic hazards can shape a community.{" "}

  One of the core principles of an effective EYFS curriculum is that it relates
  to the child as an individual and is able to support their development in a
  holistic way. Whilst the unit of work that I am going to discuss is
  predominantly literacy focused, you will notice that the environment planning
  covers a range of areas across the curriculum. Obviously, part of the
  Reception year is geared towards ensuring that children are supported for the
  transition into Year 1 and are able to meet their Early Learning Goals and
  achieve a Good Level of Development. However, planning a curriculum has to be
  much more than a check list of outcomes.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  These lesson plans try to ensure a balance between children building on their
  prior knowledge and creating links, as well as introducing them to new
  concepts and skills. There is a big debate in education over a knowledge rich
  or skills rich curriculum, however, in EYFS the two are arguably much more
  intrinsically linked and perhaps defining them as such is just an issue of
  semantics. The entirety of the EYFS should be a cumulative curriculum which is
  why I always start planning a unit of work by first looking at where the
  pupils need to get to in relation to where they currently are, what skills and
  knowledge they have already gained and then work on closing that gap.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This topic of ‘The Leopard’s Drum’ provided me with lots of opportunities to
  introduce new ideas, linked to the physical geography of Ghana and the concept
  of Folk Tales, whilst ensuring that the key themes that were already of
  interest to my pupils, such as animals and oral retelling were developed
  further.
</span>
$EndContent $EndAccordion

Now we will focus on the identifying the essential concepts, knowledge and skills for your scheme of learning. To help you to do this, we will highlight attention on two types of knowledge in particular: foundational knowledge and vocabulary.

## Foundational concepts and knowledge

Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.
Foundational concepts - also known as “threshold” concepts - are key ideas that have the potential to unlock a pupil’s understanding of a subject.

Without an understanding of such foundational concepts, pupils will struggle to grasp future learning in that subject (Enser 2018).

Hence, explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within a subject area is beneficial and should be designed into the curriculum.

Every subject has foundational concepts that form the basis of a pupil’s mental models. These concepts are often introduced to children early on in their education to be revisited and built on as they grow and develop their mental models.

$I
For example, in geography pupils need to master the foundational concept of tectonic plates in order to build their understanding of this key subject area throughout their education:

<ul>
  <li>
    The concept of tectonic plates may be introduced to children in the Early
    Years, where they may paint pictures of exploding volcanoes.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Key Stage 1, pupils might learn about famous historical examples of
    volcanoes and earthquakes.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Key Stage 2, pupils might learn about the different tectonic plates
    around the world and how these led to the types of natural disasters they
    encountered in Key Stage 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Key Stage 3, pupils might learn about how volcanoes and earthquakes are
    caused by the movement of tectonic plates.
  </li>
  <li>
    At Key Stage 4, pupils may learn about how the direction and speed of
    tectonic plates moving relative to one-another determines the type,
    magnitude, and frequency of tectonic activity.
  </li>
  <li>
    At Key Stage 5, pupils may learn how scientists monitor the movement of
    tectonic plates in order to predict and alert people to potential
    earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    At university, students might learn about plate tectonic modelling and they
    may go on to write their PhD thesis on the constraints of tectonic
    subduction.
  </li>
</ul>
$I

As you can see from this example, the concept of tectonic plates is revisited at different stages of a pupil’s education, each time building on the knowledge that has come before. This enables pupils to learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge and incorporating them into their mental models.

## Vocabulary

In Module 5 we looked at how every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills. One part of this is teaching vocabulary.

Every subject has unfamiliar vocabulary that needs to be taught to ensure pupils can access the curriculum and explain their emerging thinking and ideas. From a subject point of view, pupils’ literacy is best developed by focusing on high-utility words (the words that are most useful to know in our subject area) and high-frequency (the words that are used most frequently).

We also need to teach pupils Tier 3 subject specific vocabulary like “tectonic plates”, “magnitude”, or “subduction” in geography, and Tier 2 academic vocabulary like “criticise”, “analyse” and “therefore” - or with younger children what we might think of as ‘wow words’ like “exaggerate”, “glean” or “mysteriously”. Identifying and teaching this vocabulary as part of the scheme of work is critical for successful learning.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Foundational concepts and knowledge are the building blocks to any scheme and
  in geography. When planning the Year 7 Plate Tectonics scheme, I created a
  knowledge organiser, which included the foundational concepts and knowledge
  the pupils would need. I selected these by writing out the key things that I
  needed pupils to know by the end of the scheme. These are the things that if
  pupils didn’t learn them, I would feel they had been short changed.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For example, foundational knowledge included the structure of the earth and
  how the crust is broken up into segments that are constantly moving. This
  knowledge is fundamental to this scheme but also to their future learning in
  the subject and so I need to ensure that pupils finish the scheme confident on
  this concept. Another example is that in geography, pupils are often required
  to think through cause, effect and response. These appear throughout the
  subject and so I needed my pupils to be secure in these concepts by the end of
  the scheme. For example, for a volcanic eruption, the cause is the set of
  tectonic processes that lead to the rise and eruption of magma, volcanic gas
  and other volcanic materials and the effects are the results of that volcanic
  eruption, such as deaths, injuries, water pollution from the ash, and the
  destruction of buildings and communication systems. Finally, we look at how
  people respond to the disaster, including actions like search and rescue,
  rebuilding works and environmental restoration programmes. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The foundational knowledge also included specific examples of tectonic events,
  where pupils are able to study the causes, effects and responses to particular
  tectonic events. In this scheme pupils look particularly at the Fuego Volcano
  eruption in Guatemala in 2018. And detailing this information on the knowledge
  organiser means that the pupils and I have a clear picture of the core
  knowledge, concepts and skills pupils need for successful learning.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As we’ve discussed previously, the EYFS works as a cumulative curriculum, so
  lots of the foundational knowledge that I wanted children to achieve during
  this scheme of work was a continuation of their Prime and Specific areas of
  development. Oral re-telling of stories is a key part of the Reception Year;
  it increases vocabulary and awareness of story structure, as well as their
  self-confidence, listening and attention. Research has taught us that before
  you can write something, you have to be able to say it, which is why this
  series of lessons is an effective tool for early writing, alongside a strong
  phonics scheme. However, in addition to these cumulative skills which develop
  across the year, each unit also has its own specific foundational knowledge.
  In the case of ‘The Leopard’s Drum,’ this was related to the geography and
  traditions of Ghana, as well as native animals. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The EYFS curriculum surrounding this aspect of the curriculum simply states,
  “Children know about similarities and differences in relation to places,
  objects, materials and living things. They talk about the features of their
  own immediate environment and how environments might vary from one another”
  (Development Matters). This leaves a lot of scope for the practitioner to
  identify which places and discussion points to cover. This was a topic that I
  had not taught before, so I started by doing some research myself and thinking
  of the key facts and misconceptions around it that I wanted pupils to know.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The concept of location is quite a difficult one to grasp when aged four and
  five years old, and I wanted my students to have a real grasp of where Ghana
  was and understand that it was another country. This meant that we first
  needed to establish some more tangible knowledge based on where they live and
  where our school is and then if any of them have family and friends who live
  abroad. This concept is one that will be revisited many times, so it is
  important that it is explained clearly to avoid misconceptions. We looked at
  modes of transport and explored how one might travel to Ghana and how long it
  would take in order to give them some context. Our whole school approach to
  oral re-telling is to use BSL signs and so the key vocabulary and appropriate
  signs formed part of the foundational knowledge. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The foundational knowledge also linked to other areas of the curriculum. Here
  we used inspiration from the theme to expand their knowledge particularly in
  Express Arts and Design. Children were introduced to Ghanaian artwork, in
  particular the use of patterns, which we then used to create our own designs
  exploring using different media for a purpose and embellishing our creations
  to improve them. This development of ideas was the next step in embedding
  Characteristics of Effective Learning for many pupils.

## Overview

Once you have identified the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and vocabulary you want to pupils to learn and why, the next step is to decide in what order, or sequence you will teach them.

This session will focus on:

- Planning for assessment over time
- Sequencing essential concepts, knowledge and skills

## Sequencing teaching and learning: Introduction

Once you have identified the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and vocabulary you want to pupils to learn and why, the next step is to decide in what order, or sequence you will teach them.

As you may recall, in all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge and organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models.

$I

Carefully sequencing teaching and learning to facilitate this process is essential. To do this, we need to:

<ul>
  <li>
    Sequence content so that pupils secure foundational concepts and knowledge
    before encountering content that builds upon this
  </li>
  <li>Revisit the big ideas of a subject over time</li>
  <li>
    Draw explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles
    in the subject

Keeping the metaphor of a roadmap in mind will help you stay focused on the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of the content to be taught, which should support you to think about the most logical teaching sequence.

## Planning for assessment over time

In module 4 you learnt about how to use assessment and feedback to greatest effect. This included the point that effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.

Your scheme of work will be providing the framework and guide to the teaching and learning of your topic over a period of time. So, your scheme needs to build in enough space for formative assessment activities to inform the teaching and learning of the concepts, knowledge and skills as the scheme progresses. Returning to the metaphor of a roadmap, this ensures teachers can respond to pupils’ needs and adjust the ‘route’ as the scheme is taught.

Additionally, there will be critical moments in your sequence of teaching and learning where it will be necessary to check that pupils have understood foundational concepts or knowledge before moving on.

Your school will also use a range of assessments and these will look different, depending on the phase, subject and year group you are planning this scheme of work for.

$I
A scheme of work is likely to include some assessment opportunities, such as:

<ul>
  <li>
    Formative assessment tasks or activities linked to the over-arching learning
    objectives of the scheme of work
  </li>
  <li>
    And, possibly, a summative assessment task at the end of the teaching period
    (such as a test or an essay or performance piece) to showcase the learning
  </li>
</ul>
$I

However, it will not detail all the classroom practice, including all assessment activities, that a teacher will carry out. If it did, it would become a very unwieldy guide, but most importantly it could restrict a teacher’s ability to respond to the needs of their pupils. Learning is unpredictable and a scheme of work will be unable to anticipate how the learning will unfold for all pupils.

When planning for assessment in your scheme of work, teachers using the scheme should be clear about the decision(s) it will used to support (e.g. whether to move on or re-teach a concept) and be able to justify its use.

$CTA
Use the questions below (adapted from module 4) to help guide your planning of assessment:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      At what points in the scheme of work should learning objectives be
      assessed to inform future teaching and learning?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What would be a good method of assessment?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What will teachers do with the information?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      How are teachers going to feed back the information to pupils?
    </strong>

When planning a scheme of work, once you have decided on the foundational concepts, knowledge and skills, you then have to decide how to order them.

There is real skill to doing this as the sequencing can make or break a pupil’s overall engagement and understanding. A poorly sequenced scheme is like a tv series that is jumping around, that you can’t follow, where you are expected to already know things about the characters or plot that you haven’t yet been told. This is very frustrating for viewers and is similarly frustrating for pupils.

When thinking about sequencing, I have found it helpful to think about building from the ground up and never assuming any knowledge. If the knowledge is key, then it needs to be explicitly taught, or we run the risk of widening the educational gap. This means when I think I have my starting point, I carefully check that I am not relying on pupils’ knowing or understanding a concept that I haven’t explicitly taught, or a skill I am assuming they have that I have not explicitly practised with them.

For example, the lesson on how earthquakes take place requires a solid grounding on the structure of the earth and how tectonic plates behave, so it has to come after the lessons that teach those elements. But, it has to come before the lesson on the effects of earthquakes because pupils have to be able to understand the mechanics of earthquakes to understand why the effects can be so severe.

Finally, I think it is better to cover less material but in a more thorough way, rather than doing a cursory glance over a very broad array of things, which pupils won’t be able to remember or engage with sufficiently. Allowing breathing time in case something needs to be revisited is an important element of this. So, I think one of the most important skills in designing a curriculum is discerning what to exclude as much as what to include. There is never enough time to do everything!

  Once you have assessed the pupils’ current level, any prior knowledge they
  have linked to the topic, their current skill set in both prime and specific
  areas that are linked to the scheme of work, understood where you want them to
  get to, the foundational knowledge to be obtained and progression of key
  skills, you can work out how best to get them there. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  We know that pupils need many opportunities for daily and weekly retrieval, so
  this is key when sequencing a scheme of work. In addition to this, crucially
  for younger pupils, we also need to consider their attention span and think
  carefully about using every moment effectively and referring to material as
  frequently as possible throughout the day, not just during the core lessons,
  to help build up their schema.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When thinking about sequencing in English specifically, I think about first
  ensuring the key building block or central information for the given theme. In
  the context of this scheme of work, it was knowledge of the text. Once we had
  established “The Leopard’s Drum” as our new story then it was easier to link
  everything else back to that e.g. our story is set in Ghana, let’s find out
  some more information about that, in the story Nyame wears a patterned cloak I
  wonder if we can discover more about Ghanaian patterns? Having the story
  cemented first allows everything else to flow together a lot more and helps
  maintain the holistic element without it becoming too disjointed for the
  pupils. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Crucially, I think it’s important to remember that you can’t cover everything,
  especially when working in EYFS! As discussed earlier, one of my favourite
  things about the EYFS is how it is so unpredictable. I have always carefully
  designed my curriculum to cover the EYFS and introduce my pupils to a wide
  range of life experiences, however, sometimes a tooth falls out in the middle
  of your lesson and it’s okay to stop the lesson and use their enthusiasm to
  introduce letter writing and compose a note to the Tooth Fairy altogether
  instead! I find that I often see the best learning happen during their play
  and it is the job of a skilled practitioner to take the key learning to them
  by sometimes ignoring planning and following the children’s interests.

You are now going to use the following points to guide you through sequencing the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and vocabulary in your own scheme of work.

- Begin to organise the content (concepts, knowledge, skills) into a logical order
- Identify where you will be introducing new content (including new vocabulary)
- Identify the explicit links to draw between this new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject (i.e. pupils’ prior knowledge and the big ideas of the subject)
- Identify assessment opportunities

Using this order you can start to:

- Formulate learning objectives to be achieved across the scheme of work
- Begin to estimate the time it will take to teach each learning objective _(an objective could run over a number of lessons)_
- Plan in assessment opportunities

  <li>
    <strong>Is the flow of the curriculum logical and coherent?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Do the learning objectives ensure that pupils’ thinking is focused on the
      key ideas within the subject?
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Is there enough time for the content to be well-taught, e.g. enough time

This session will take **approximately 45 minutes** to complete.

## Overview

This session will focus on:

- Anticipating common misconceptions
- Identifying subject knowledge gaps
- Tackling common misconceptions

## Introduction

So far in this module we have focused on ‘the what’ and ‘the why’ of curriculum planning and you have produced a draft sequence of the learning objectives and associated content of your scheme of work. In this and the following session we will look at how, through careful curriculum design, you can help your pupils to master these important concepts, knowledge and skills. We will be drawing upon and applying knowledge from modules 3 and 4 to help you to do this.

Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively. This is because it is through an understanding of how to teach a subject (often referred to as pedagogical content knowledge) that teachers develop:

> ‘The most useful forms of representation of those ideas, the most powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and demonstrations—in a word, the most useful ways of representing and formulating the subject that make it comprehensible to others.’ (Ball et al. 2008)

This type of subject knowledge also includes an understanding of what makes a topic easy or difficult and the likely misconceptions pupils will bring to the learning of a topic.

In this section we are going to think about how you can use your subject knowledge, and the experience of other colleagues, to increase the likelihood that your scheme will lead to successful learning for your pupils. We will focus on common misconceptions and the most useful ways to represent and develop understanding of the concepts, knowledge and skills in your scheme of work.

## Anticipating common misconceptions

In module 3 you learnt how process questions are more likely to reveal pupil misconceptions, and in module 4, how to monitor pupil work for misconceptions. In this module we are going to focus on how you can work to anticipate and tackle common misconceptions as part of careful curriculum design.

A misconception is a wrong or inaccurate idea based on faulty thinking or understanding. A common misconception is a wrong idea that many people have. For pupils, the most important common misconceptions to anticipate, are the ones which relate to foundational concepts. This is because misconceptions can be difficult to shift but doing so can lead to big gains in learning, particularly for threshold concepts (Education Endowment Foundation (2018) Improving Secondary Science Guidance Report).

Therefore, anticipating common misconceptions within subject areas is also an important aspect of curriculum knowledge and working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.

### Here are some examples of common pupil misconceptions:

$I

<h4>
  <strong>Science (Biology)</strong>
</h4>
Misconception: all cells are the same size and shape.

Correct idea: different cells can have different sizes and shapes.
$I

$I

<h4>
  <strong>Geography (Plate tectonics) </strong>
</h4>
Misconception: The earth’s plates are made of solid rock that can never be seen because
the plates are always deep within the earth.

Correct idea: Earth's plates are made of solid rock, and they can be seen where they are not covered by soil, loose rocks, or water.

<em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">
  [The above examples were taken from: AAAS Project 2061
  http://assessment.aaas.org/topics]
</em>
$I

$I

<h4>
  <strong>Modern Foreign Languages (French) </strong>
</h4>
Misconception:  J’ai is translated as ‘I am’

Correct idea: J’ai is translated as ‘I have’.

This misunderstanding stems from pupils learning that ‘J’ai onze ans’ is translated as ‘I am 11 years old’; j’ai is used in this context leading pupils to think that ‘j’ai’ means ‘I am’.
$I

$I

<h4>
  <strong>History </strong>
</h4>
Misconception: thinking capitalism is synonymous with democracy

Correct idea: capitalism is an economic system, and so capitalist economies can operate in dictatorships &amp; other non-democratic regimes, as well as in democracies.
$I

So good curriculum design includes being aware of common misconceptions and this requires secure subject knowledge:

> “The most effective teachers have deep knowledge of the subjects they teach… As well as a strong understanding of the material being taught, teachers must also understand the ways students think about the content, be able to evaluate the thinking behind students’ own methods and identify students’ common misconceptions.” (Coe et al 2014, p.2).

Consequently, when embarking on a new topic with pupils, it is good practice to first consider your own subject knowledge and any potential knowledge gaps you may need to close, particularly those concerning foundational concepts and knowledge. It might sound obvious but making sure your subject knowledge is secure is one of the best ways to enable you to teach the content well and help pupils to master the critical components of the subject.

<h3>Identifying subject knowledge gaps</h3>

  <li>

</ul>
$CTA

## Tackling common misconceptions

It is important to remember that adults hold misconceptions as well as children. Pupils needs to feel comfortable to share their ideas with you, so that you can support the development of their thinking over time. So, an important way in which you can help pupils to master foundational concepts and knowledge is to foster a classroom climate where the sharing and discussing of ideas is encouraged.

$I
In terms of your teaching practice, here are some other ways you can respond to common misconceptions:

<ul>
  <li>Explicitly address misconceptions through explanation</li>
  <li>Provide evidence that might conflict with their thinking</li>
  <li>Provide activities to support them to restructure their thinking</li>
  <li>Use formative assessment to check that pupils’ thinking is changing</li>
  <li>
    Revisit misconceptions to remind pupils of what they thought in the
    beginning and acknowledge how their thinking has changed
  </li>
</ul>
$I

Below you will see an example of a misconception that is common for primary pupils when learning about partitioning to add. This is followed by a part-whole model which can be used to help pupils to master the concept.

In key stage one, it is common for pupils to misunderstand the place value of digits within numbers. This is problematic when solving calculations because it means they are highly likely to make errors.

For example, when teaching pupils to partition two-digit numbers to add or subtract, they will sometimes partition like this:

$Figure
$Alt 28 can be partitioned into 2 and 8. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/partioning-28-a.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption
$EndFigure

…instead of this:

$Figure
$Alt 28 can be partitioned into 20 and 8. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/partitioning-28b.jpg $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption
$EndFigure

This occurs because pupils do not have a secure understanding of the value that the digits represent.

In order to prevent this misconception from developing, it’s important to support and develop pupils’ understanding of number using concrete objects or representation when first introducing pupils to the strategy of partitioning to add. There are several ways you could do this, but one way is to use a part-whole model:

$Figure
$Alt Example of the part-whole model using the number 28. The number 20 has already been added to the lower left field, the lower right field is blank ready to be filled in. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/Part-whole-model.jpg $EndURL $Caption Figure 1: Part-whole model. $EndCaption
$EndFigure

The ‘whole’ – 28 – is represented at the top and the ‘parts’ are represented in the circles attached to the whole. Pupils could be provided with blank models to fill out or partially completed ones like the one above. They can be given Dienes blocks or place value counters to explore partitioning the numbers and identifying relationships between them.

As you can see this teaching strategy has been carefully thought about and planned into the scheme of work because the misconception is a common one for pupils. Discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils to master important concepts will support you to identify the most effective teaching methods.

## Overview

In module 3 you learnt about other teaching practices which will help pupils to master important concepts, knowledge and skills. We are now going to revisit them and consider how they can be incorporated in the context of curriculum design.

This session will focus on:

- Revisiting classroom practice

## Revisiting classroom practice: Activity

Take some time now to review the following content from module 3:

- [Session 2: Explanations and Modelling (up to and including Explanations)](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/3-what-makes-classroom-practice-effective/2-explanations-and-modelling-65-mins/)

- [Session 4: Independent Practice](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/teachfirst/teach-first/self-directed-study-material/3-what-makes-classroom-practice-effective/4-independent-practice-60-mins/)

In these sessions you learnt about how to support pupils to gradually build pupils’ knowledge throughout a lesson, but the same principles apply to a learning objective that may need to extend over a series of lessons.

You were introduced to how you could use teacher input, guided practice and independent practice to help pupils reach a learning goal. The importance of spending enough time guiding pupil practice (through explanations and modelling) before moving onto independent work was emphasised. You also explored how the use of concrete examples and non-examples can be used to support pupils to understand a more abstract concept.

  Scaffolding builds pupils’ skills and confidence and helps them to realise
  that they can use their prior knowledge to move forwards. I like to always
  provide some form of scaffold, but as we go through a scheme, the guidance
  becomes less as pupils build confidence. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When introducing a new or abstract idea in a scheme of work, I always ensure
  that these are supported with clear and concrete examples, to support pupils’
  understanding. For example, when teaching pupils about a collision plate
  margin, they learn that two tectonic plates of comparable density collide and
  buckle. As an abstract concept it makes little sense to pupils learning this
  for the first time. However, when presented with the cartoon of two cars of
  similar sizes in a head-on collision, showing both car bonnets crumpling,
  pupils are then immediately able to understand what is happening with the
  collision plate margin. And then, knowing that tectonic plates can be imagined
  as cars in collisions, they then have an understanding of the concept which
  they can use to predict what might happen at the margin between other tectonic
  plates.
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   And I think that sometimes, the more creative you can be with the
  illustrations, the more likely it is pupils will remember the illustration. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Another favourite example from a different scheme is used when teaching about
  air pressure. Pupils (and teachers!) often find the global atmospheric
  circulation system difficult to get their head around, with the behaviour of
  air pressure and the resulting weather particularly challenging. To help
  illustrate how air pressure affects weather I use an example that always makes
  pupils laugh and so helps them remember. I’ve even seen pupils discretely
  re-enacting the illustration in exams! I ask them to imagine they have a puppy
  on the table in front of them and I ask them to visualise themselves with
  their hands above the puppy, moving their hands in an upwards direction away
  from the puppy, as I tell them that their hands represent the air. Following
  some questioning they can tell me that upwards moving air and the resulting
  low pressure that is applied to the puppy, makes for unstable weather, as
  demonstrated by the wriggling and moving puppy. I then ask them to imagine
  they are applying downward pressure to the puppy and ask them how high
  pressure will affect the puppy – and usually they are able to say that the
  puppy will stop moving as much, and so see how high pressure creates stable
  weather conditions that are not moving or changing. It is a bit of a silly
  illustration but definitely helps pupils visualise how air pressure affects
  the weather conditions.

  One of the wonderful, but challenging, things about the EYFS is that there is
  no statutory knowledge that children have to acquire by the age of five. There
  are some common themes that you will see occurring in most settings e.g.
  Traditional Tales. Again, it is important to refer to the guidance and see
  what needs to be taught. For this series of lessons, I not only wanted to
  support pupils’ English development but also link that to their development of
  Understanding the World, specifically, “they know about similarities and
  differences between themselves and others, and among families, communities and
  traditions.” It was important, therefore, to provide opportunities to explore
  both the text itself and the context within which it was written. I chose this
  this text due to the large proportion of Ghanaian students within my class
  group and was fortunate enough to be able to draw upon their families’
  experiences who provided support and personal accounts of the country and its
  culture. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For a large proportion of students, this topic, along with most others,
  presented them with new ideas and information that they hadn’t previously
  encountered; some of them were slightly more abstract. It was therefore really
  important to ensure that there were as many concrete examples as possible in
  this story. In the context of ‘The Leopard’s Drum’ we used music to explore
  the ‘huge, magnificent drum’ and share ideas as to why it would have been so
  popular among the other animals. Creating opportunities to make these cross
  curricular links also extended the children’s schema enabling more chances for
  retrieval and recall. This was also done by sharing videos and images of Ghana
  itself to explore animals in their natural habitat which was useful as we had
  previously studied ‘Handa’s Surprise’ which had some similar animals as
  characters but provided opportunities to compare and contrast two African
  countries. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  One of the key objectives of this lesson series was to be able to re-tell the
  story. There was therefore a lot of scaffolding that was put in place at the
  start of the week i.e. a story map. This scaffolding empowered students with
  the confidence they needed initially, and then as the week went on, I
  gradually removed the scaffold until all students were able to confidently
  retell the story independently.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Building up pupils’ mental models is of paramount importance as this is what
  allows for pupils to be able to remember over time and draw upon the concepts,
  knowledge and skills they’ll need for successful learning now and in the
  future.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  To support this, the first strategy I use in this scheme (and all schemes) is
  retrieval and spaced practice, such as questioning and quizzing pupils on
  their knowledge each lesson and then cumulatively quizzing them throughout the
  scheme. And then for subsequent schemes in Year 7, I quiz them on previous
  schemes to keep that knowledge alive. Referring back to prior learning also
  reminds pupils of its importance.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The second strategy I use in all schemes is the use of concrete examples and
  illustrations to help pupils engage with abstract concepts. For example, in
  this scheme when teaching about volcanic hazards, I support the teaching of
  abstract concepts such as lava flows with concrete examples and images so that
  pupils can engage with the material and draw on anything relevant they might
  have stored in their long-term memory - even from films or books they have
  read or seen. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  A third strategy is the intentional teaching and revisiting of tier 2 and 3
  vocabulary. I repeatedly revisit the vocabulary in so that pupils are
  continually exposed to it. For example, starting off using technical language
  such as tectonic hazards, tectonic plates, mantle, pressure and friction means
  that we can use the correct terminology from the beginning and build up
  pupils’ familiarity with it throughout the scheme. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Finally, in this scheme, as with all schemes, I have sought to balance the use
  of exposition with pupils practising skills and knowledge, whilst always
  narrating the links between new content and the core concepts. These features
  of classroom practice help pupils to learn and build confidence, instead of
  new content causing them to panic and then retreat.

$Summary
The final version of this video will be available from spring 2021, as the publication of this programme was fast-tracked in response to disruptions to this year’s initial teacher training.
$EndSummary
$Content

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Despite the fact that we teach topics/themes/core texts that break up the
  year, the vast majority of the EYFS is one long continuous curriculum that
  runs from birth to Year 1. Thinking of it like that helps to remind
  practitioners of the need to build up pupils’ mental models across the EYFS,
  as they need to frequently revisit their learning and make those cross
  curricular links to develop now and be able to achieve success in learning as
  they get older.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The key way that I do this is through the explicit teaching of vocabulary;
  both topic specific and general conversation. In our setting both high
  frequency words and new story nouns are introduced and repeated with an action
  to help our students who struggle with communication to also retain the
  vocabulary. This is an approach that is used throughout the school, as we know
  that the use of consistent non-verbal’s (such as ‘yes’ and ‘no’) allows
  students to free up some of their working memory. I try to use BSL as
  frequently as possible for this, i.e. in our retelling of ‘The Leopard’s
  Drum’, we used the BSL signs for each of the animals. These signs then acted
  as a piece of scaffolding for students who needed it when retelling the
  story. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, I use retrieval practice in both this
  series of lesson and all (see Rosenshine for more on this). Quizzing is
  something that I initially found challenging to incorporate into EYFS but
  found that once I had dedicated a considerable amount of time to  embedding
  the routines with pupils, i.e. TTYP, Show Me (see TLAC for more on these AFL
  techniques) I discovered that it was an incredibly useful strategy to ensure
  children were retaining key knowledge and vocabulary from previous sessions.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Finally, in this scheme, as with all schemes, I made sure to create lots of
  opportunities for modelling following an, I do, We/You do approach. My EYFS
  works in a way that not all students will engage in the same activity at the
  same time as we need to develop the whole child and think of their
  Characteristics of Effective Learning. However, this being the case it is
  crucial that all students have the chance to observe and participate in
  writing opportunities. Writing is particularly important as we can see from
  data that that is the area where most children struggle to achieve.
  Pre-writing activities and talk in particular, such as we see in this scheme
  with opportunities to re-tell and engage in class discussion, are key. More
  students are entering school working below the expected standard for
  Communication and Language so, we need to first embed these prime areas before
  moving onto the specific.

<h3>
  <strong>Reflection</strong>
</h3>
Now review and edit your scheme of work, considering the questions below:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Where will you build on pupils’ prior knowledge?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Where would it support pupils’ understanding to use worked and partially
      completed examples
    </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How will you build in spaced exposition and practice?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Where will you build in retrieval practice?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
When thinking about the last two questions, it is important to think more broadly
about where your scheme fits into the wider curriculum. For example, you may want
to include practice of information taught in a previous scheme of work, or the retrieval
of knowledge previously taught. Working with colleagues to facilitate this, will
support the overall sequencing and coherence of your curriculum.

Prepare to share your evolving scheme of work with your mentor.

## The difficulty of transferring knowledge

When thinking about supporting pupils to build increasingly complex mental models, it is important to understand that pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context. This is particularly relevant for curriculum design, as we may want to make use of and bring attention to, the links between different subjects and our own. This can enrich the curriculum and support pupils to build their mental models however, because of the point above it needs careful thought and planning.

For example, we might want pupils to use their mathematical knowledge in a geographical context and assume that they can transfer their knowledge of the use scale factors and maps to a geography task. This assumption is understandable but, pupils are unlikely to be able to do this well because ‘the use of scale factors’ is an abstract idea and they are being asked to use this knowledge in an unfamiliar context. This assumption can lead to a frustrating experience for both teacher and pupils.

<strong>
  From what you have learnt across the modules so far, what do you think the
  teacher could do to support pupils to transfer their knowledge from one
  discipline to another?
</strong>

<strong> </strong>

Please record your ideas.

$CTA

$I
Below are some ways the teacher, in the previous example, could support the transfer of knowledge:

<ul>
  <li>
    Check that pupils have the foundational knowledge of scale factors and maps
    that is required
  </li>
  <li>
    Check that pupils have the foundational geographical knowledge required
  </li>
  <li>
    Draw explicit links to this prior knowledge and support pupils to bring the
    right ideas from their long-term memory into their working memory
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide examples of this knowledge being used in a maths context (that they
    are familiar with) and a geographical context (which is new) and get pupils
    to compare examples
  </li>
  <li>
    Use worked examples and partially completed examples to support pupils to
    apply their prior knowledge in this new context
  </li>
</ul>

## Thinking critically within a subject area

Another important reason for thinking carefully about what concepts or knowledge should be taught in a curriculum, is that we often want pupils to think critically within a subject. However, for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of the knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. If we don’t explicitly teach the relevant domain-specific knowledge, our pupils are likely to struggle with any activity that requires critical thinking.

We are going to use a cooking analogy to help us to understand this idea. Let’s think about the ‘dish’ as the demonstration of pupils’ critical thinking about a subject area. Let’s then think about the ‘ingredients’ that are used to produce this dish, as the relevant domain-specific knowledge.

Firstly, if pupils do not know what the ingredients are, they are very unlikely to be able to make the dish! However, often we will tell pupils what the ingredients are and expect that this will be enough for them to be able to make a dish. In order to think critically, or in this analogy use the ingredients to cook, they need to have these ingredients easily at hand.

For our pupils this means that they need to have enough relevant subject knowledge in their long-term memory to draw upon in order to think or ‘cook’ well. The more developed pupils’ mental models are, the better able they will be draw upon the knowledge or ‘ingredients’ when they are asked to think critically. In other words, pupils will be able to cook a far more successful and satisfying ‘dish’!

Another pitfall for supporting pupils’ critical thinking is to focus too much on the process or the product of their critical thinking. For example, spending a disproportionate amount of time on learning how to structure a critical essay or looking at model answers, rather than spending enough time to help pupils master the domain specific knowledge required to think well about the subject area. To use the above analogy again, we might spend a lot of time learning about how to use the kitchen appliances or follow the steps of a recipe, but without good knowledge of the ingredients and their properties, we would be unlikely to be able to cook anything that was edible or tasty.

Your upcoming training session will focus more on how to help pupils apply knowledge and skills to other contexts.

## One final word about curriculum

During this module, you have designed a carefully sequenced and coherent, scheme of work. This will act as a guide for you and any other teachers you share it with. When it comes to teaching your scheme of work, remember that it serves you best as a _roadmap_.

A roadmap will show the destination (the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the content to be taught) and the best route to get there (the teaching practices and materials most likely to lead to successful learning). As you begin to follow the roadmap you have planned out, remember to be flexible, adjusting your route to the needs of your pupils, as the scheme unfolds.

Viewed in this light, your scheme of work should be a dynamic and evolving guide. As you are teaching it, reflect on what’s working well and what isn’t. Make adaptations to it as you go, responding to the strengths and needs of your pupils as they emerge. Keep a note of these changes and add comments to help you to evaluate the success of the scheme as whole. That way, you can make amendments and improvements for the next time you teach it.

Note that one key indicator of the success of a scheme of work is that at any stage, you can explain why you are teaching something, and your pupils understand why they are learning it. If we understand how a scheme of work links to the bigger picture, we can help our pupils to make these connections and the learning becomes more motivating and meaningful for everyone.

Finally, it’s worth adding the best curriculum design happens when teachers work together. So, proactively seek out opportunities to work with other teachers, contributing to curriculum development in your school and beyond.
