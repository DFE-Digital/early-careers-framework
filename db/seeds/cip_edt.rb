## Welcome

Across the two years, ECTs will work through 12 Blocks in total, one per half term. Each Block has been designed based on international best practice of effective professional development, and includes interactive self-study materials that explain the research behind the Early Career Framework and give exemplifications of what this looks like in the classroom. There is also protected time in Year 1 as part of these materials to observe colleagues and to be observed.

Each Block provides ECTs with the time to:

- **Learn** the content from the Early Career Framework
- Put the learning into **practice** with suggestions for classroom practice
- **Reflect** on their professional and personal development.

For more information on the programme structure and suggestions on well-being and workload, see the [Overview of the Core Induction Programme (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Overview-of-EDTs-Core-Induction-Programme.pdf)

$EndSummary
$Content
Year 1 is an introduction to the key themes and statements in the Early Career Framework. The focus is on helping Early Career Teachers (ECTs) to establish themselves in the classroom, drawing on the best international evidence for what works in education. ECTs will work on core principles and techniques of effective teaching, including lesson planning, expositions, assessment, feedback and managing behaviour. Throughout each Block (module) they will find practical, accessible self-study activities to support their development. These will be further supplemented by regular sessions with their Mentor and training sessions led by an expert practitioner. These sessions are designed to support ECTs to translate the research into their classroom, with opportunities to discuss research, observe colleagues, practise new techniques and reflect on their progress and next steps.

The structure of the Blocks in Year 2 replicates that of Year 1. Any remaining statements from the Early Career Framework will be covered, and many of the same themes from Year 1 will be revisited in greater depth to strengthen and further ECTs’ practice. During Year 2, the focus is on mastering key ideas in the Early Career Framework. ECTs will be encouraged to reflect on the links between themes, in the light of their increasing knowledge and developing practice. They will continue to work with their Mentor to reflect on the progress they have made, and by the end of the year they will identify future opportunities for development or specialisation for the next stage of their career. Training sessions provide additional support and access to a supportive peer network of other Early Career Teachers.

## Time commitment

- 5 hours of self-study materials
- 6 x 1-hour mentor sessions
- 3 hours of training sessions

## Why this, why now?

Getting the culture right in your classroom from the outset is a vital part of making sure your pupils learn. This Block will cover the ways in which you can actively create a positive, productive and efficient learning environment. There will be a strong emphasis on how you manage behaviour; once you secure this, you will be able to refine your practice in other areas. You will explore how you can establish your own routines and expectations, using your school policy to help you. The importance of building relationships will also be covered. Pupils need to feel that they are in safe hands: to believe that their feelings will be considered and understood. You will explore how you can develop a culture of respect and trust in the classroom.

## Your workload

Managing low level disruption and implementing a behaviour policy can increase your workload and feel like a lot of pressure. Learning how to create a positive climate for learning in this Block will support you with your workload by:

- Helping you make your expectations of pupils clear to reduce low-level disruption.
- Supporting you in teaching and embedding routines and rules to reduce the need for behaviour interventions.
- Teaching you how to use the least invasive behaviour strategies to avoid escalating behaviour incidents unnecessarily.

## Time commitment

- 4 hours self-directed study materials
- 7 x 1-hour mentor sessions
- 2 x training sessions

## Why this, why now?

Helping pupils to learn is the cornerstone of what teaching is all about. Despite best intentions learning does not always take place. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as: you teach it, they learn it. Learning is affected by a multitude of factors such as what prior knowledge pupils had, how many distractions there were in the classroom, and how much new content is being introduced at one time. There have been significant advances in cognitive science over the past 40 years which have led to an understanding of ‘cognitive load’ and how it influences learning.

Understanding cognitive load helps teachers know how pupils learn, and importantly, how they can design instruction which optimises the environment for learning to take place. There are some really important factors of memory and cognition which underpin learning and this Block will help you to understand these and their implications for teaching.

## Your workload

Your time as a teacher is a precious resource. By using evidence-informed approaches to manage cognitive load, you maximise the potential for learning in every lesson. Instead of having to re-teach something later in the year, you can focus on getting it right the first time.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Welcome to Block 1. Block 1 is about creating an effective climate for
  learning for your pupils.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It is natural for behaviour management to preoccupy new teachers. Poor
  behaviour makes it hard for pupils to learn. As a teacher, the feeling of not
  being in charge of the lesson can be really demoralising. You will inevitably
  contrast what you do with more experienced colleagues, but it can be hard to
  identify the strategies they use to develop a positive climate for learning.
  It can be easy to assume that you either have ‘it’ or you don’t. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The good news is that this doesn’t need to be the case! A positive learning
  environment is carefully crafted through specific teacher planning and
  actions, and everyone can do this. In short, you need to teach your pupils how
  to behave in your classroom, setting clear expectations and reinforcing these
  with consistent routines. Over time, this will help pupils understand how to
  take responsibility for their behaviour, through self-regulation, monitoring
  their own actions, and making the right choices. In this type of environment,
  pupils will feel more supported and secure, and you will be happier in your
  job.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When you know what to look for, you will see two different aspects of
  behaviour management. One is the multi-faceted skill of dealing effectively
  with instances of misbehaviour. This is a skill which improves with
  experience, but it’s also something that is dependent on knowing your pupils
  well as individuals. The second, more desirable, aspect is the proactive
  orchestration of classroom conditions in which poor behaviour is less likely
  to happen. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  To help with this, your goal should be to develop positive relationships and a
  culture of respect and trust with your pupils. Get to know your pupils, learn
  their names, talk to them about how they are learning and tell them what you
  expect of them. Give them the chance to learn how to behave well, and model
  this yourself. Your school will have policies and practices to support you and
  these should be followed from the outset. However, systems and policies alone
  cannot create a positive learning environment. Your actions,{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  behaviour and how you respond to your pupils are key. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  teachers we remember the most are those who were fair and consistent in how
  they treated us. They are also the ones we knew had high expectations of both
  our behaviour and what we could achieve. They inspired us to do more, do
  better and produce our best. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You are responsible for creating and managing the climate within your
  classroom. Your actions can influence the way your pupils behave, the way that
  they feel about your lessons and the results they achieve. This Block has been
  designed to support you in securing the kind of positive climate for learning
  which will have a direct impact on your teaching and your pupils’ learning. It
  will help you do all of the things we have just described: develop and
  reinforce rules and routines, support you in establishing positive
  relationships with pupils and show you ways to set and maintain high
  expectations.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Creating a culture in which pupils want to work hard and actively resist
  temptations to misbehave will benefit both your workload and wellbeing but
  also your pupils’ attitudes, wellbeing and motivation. It is not something
  that can be established instantly but instead something that is consciously
  crafted over time. However, if you consistently teach and model your rules,
  routines and expectations and embed these securely, a positive climate for
  learning will follow before too long.

## Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils

You have likely imagined yourself as a teacher with your own class, and what it will look and feel like in your classroom. It is likely to include positive pupils who are motivated to learn and who do not misbehave. This dream can be a reality. Through your direct actions and behaviours as the teacher you have the ability to influence all of this.

Behaviour management can be one of the most challenging parts of teaching for all teachers and it might well be something you are feeling worried about. Learning how to manage behaviour effectively makes a big difference to pupils’ learning, contributes to improved outcomes and will make you feel significantly happier about your role (Education Endowment Foundation, 2019). It also significantly improves pupil wellbeing in the classroom. Children who are calm and secure in their surroundings are more likely to learn; it is our job as teachers to ensure that our classrooms provide this environment. All teachers, no matter what stage of their career they are at, need to keep developing their skills in managing behaviour.

## Establishing and reinforcing routines creates a positive climate for learning

The research in this area is clear. Classroom climate and management are key to maximising the learning that can take place (Coe et al, 2014). Not surprisingly, the choices teachers make about how they manage their classroom can have a significant, positive effect on reducing misbehaviour (Valdebenito et al., 2018). Establishing the learning environment plays an important role in pupil engagement (Gutman & Schoon, 2013). In particular, showing our pupils what is expected of them through routines promotes good behaviour (Institute of Education Sciences, 2008; Education Endowment Foundation, 2019).

It can be motivating for pupils to know what is expected from them. The vast majority of pupils want to do well and will be motivated to meet your expectations. When it is made clear what is expected, they will know how they should behave. We can help our pupils with this through establishing routines for the everyday things that happen in our lessons.

$I
Routines can be used for most common classroom activities, such as:

<ul>
  <li>Entering the classroom</li>
  <li>Starts and ends of lessons</li>
  <li>Starting and finishing work</li>
  <li>Transitions between activities or places in the learning environment</li>
  <li>Taking out and putting away resources</li>
  <li>Whole class teaching and discussion</li>
  <li>Handing out equipment.</li>
</ul>
$I

Making your pupils feel safe and secure is an important part of teaching and also improves pupil wellbeing. Classrooms should be predictable environments with clear rules, routines and expectations about behaviour as well as learning, which offer all pupils opportunities for success (Kern & Clemens, 2007; Rosenshine, 2012). Teachers should set high standards for behaviour as well as for learning and believe that their pupils can meet these standards (Willingham, 2009). When you establish a calm, purposeful learning environment, pupils will:

- Be more likely to behave well
- Be able to concentrate and therefore learn
- Be motivated to learn
- Have increased wellbeing
- Feel secure enough to take risks and show you their thinking (see Block 2).

Routines, by definition, need to happen in the same way every time, making your classroom a predictable and safe place; pupils will know where they stand and what you expect from them.

What do more experienced teachers do to establish and maintain these routines? The table below shows three key strategies:

| Strategy                          | How it is effective                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit instructions             | Tells pupils exactly what you expect to see and means expectations cannot be misinterpreted.                                  | “When you come into the classroom, I expect each person to be silent. That means no one will talk.” |
| Reminders                         | Reminding pupils of rules and routines means that they will be reinforced, and pupils are more likely to remember what to do. | “I need all eyes on me and conversations finished by the time I have counted down to 1. 3,2,1.”     |
| Consistent modelling of behaviour | Modelling the behaviour you expect to see shows pupils what you want from them and makes this explicit.                       | “Pens down (puts pen down) and looking this way without talking (hand to lips).”                    |

Another way we can strengthen and embed our routines is through positive reinforcement. Positively reinforcing what we want to see reduces poor behaviour and helps increase academic engagement (Institute of Education, Sciences 2008). It is also motivating and supports pupil wellbeing. When we praise and give attention to the specific behaviour we want to see, it increases the likelihood of that behaviour happening again. It will also encourage other pupils to follow suit. The same is true in reverse: if a pupil continuously calls out and the teacher responds to them, they are receiving attention for that behaviour and are likely to repeat it. Positive reinforcement should be used strategically to nurture the behaviour we _want_ to see.

This table shows three ways positive reinforcement can support routines and good behaviour.

| Strategy                                                         | How it is effective                                                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                             |

Routines need to be actively taught and reinforced frequently, with reasons, so that pupils understand what is expected of them (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). In Activity 1.3, we look at how teachers can establish effective routines. Pupils should recognise routines as the ‘norms’ of the classroom. If you have effective routines, pupils will follow them consistently and efficiently, maximising time for learning.

In the first section of this activity, we looked at using rules and routines to support an effective climate for learning. In part b we take a closer look at how our relationships with pupils and our expectations of them can have a direct impact on behaviour and the learning environment in our classroom.

## Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture

To create a calm, purposeful classroom environment, it is key to focus on the positive behaviours you expect (Coe et al, 2014). You can do this through:

- Conveying clear expectations (“this is how we do things here”)
- Giving precise instructions about what is expected.

This clarity of expectations is essential to securing good behaviour from your pupils. In communicating these standards, we also need to explain in detail how pupils are expected to meet them. Experienced teachers will do this explicitly, early on with every new class and continue to reinforce their expectations all the time. They also lead by example, role-modelling the behaviours they expect from pupils.

Look at the cartoon below which highlights this.

| Avoid focusing on secondary behaviours, like eye-rolling, huffing, sulking. “Don’t use that tone of voice to speak to me.” | Enable pupils to respond to expectations. “I’ll give you a few minutes now to get on with your work over there."          |

It is important to maintain a positive, calm climate and we can do this through focusing on what we want to see pupils doing. Teachers can use both verbal and non-verbal prompts to communicate their expectations of behaviour to the pupils. It is also important that you give pupils an opportunity to adjust their behaviour before escalating things.

| Verbal prompts                                                                                                              | Non-verbal prompts                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| - Instructions - Praise - Saying “Thank you” - Reinforcement - Giving pupils choices - Reminders of school behaviour policy | - Smiling or frowning - Nodding or shaking head - Eye contact - Hand signals like thumbs up - Position in the room - Silent speaking – mouthing “thank you” or “no” to a pupil - Turning a pupil’s book to the right page |

While pupils should have a clear understanding of our general expectations for their behaviour, this should be reinforced for specific activities. When giving task instructions we need to make it clear to pupils what we want them to do and the behaviour we expect to see as they complete the task. Being crystal clear about our expectations will support our pupils in knowing exactly what to do.

When explaining a task, you should:

- Provide clear instructions to complete it
- Provide clear expectations for behaviour, for example that the task should be completed in silence or in pairs etc.

Once you have given instructions:

- Visibly scan the room to check who is following your instructions
- Praise pupils who have begun the task
- Verbally remind anyone who is speaking that the task is to be completed in silence
- Use non-verbal signals to encourage slow starters to begin.

Watch the video to see this in practice.

NARRATION

Making sure that you are very clear in your instructions and about your expectations when it comes to behaviour is essential. Part of that is checking that pupils have understood your instructions.

You can do this by praising those who follow your instructions. And you can offer polite but firm reminders to pupils who do not follow your instructions.

Remember that in addition to what you say, non-verbal communication can be very effective. Holding a finger to your lips may be just as effective as telling people to be quiet.

CLASSROOM INTERACTION

We are going to look back at the persuasive leaflets we wrote in the last lesson and check that we have used all of the key features of persuasive texts.

Make a note of any features you have not used.

Select one feature that you have used effectively and write a sentence or two explaining why you think it is effective.

I want you to open your books and spend five minutes doing this in silence.

[Teacher scans the room to check who is following instructions]

Amar, I can see you have started already and so have several others – well done.

Holly, we are working in silence, thank you.

## Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes

We know that our beliefs can be very influential. What you believe your pupils to be capable of achieving will directly influence what they actually achieve (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018). The Pygmalion or ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ research (Rosenthal et al) in the 1960s showed that when teachers (but not their pupils) were told by researchers that a random group of their pupils had achieved high scores on an aptitude test, these pupils did better over the course of the year than the ‘ordinary’ pupils in their classes. In reality, the test was made up. Not knowing this, the teachers were shown to ask more questions, give more thinking time and provide more feedback to the pupils they believed to be more able. Clearly what you think of your pupils’ abilities and how you plan to meet their needs matters hugely. The higher the expectations you have of your pupils, the more you will push and challenge them and the more their outcomes will improve (Murdock-Perriera & Sedlacek, 2018).

It is important that you hold high expectations of all your pupils and convey these clearly and consistently through the challenge you provide for them. Show each individual pupil that you believe they can succeed. If you expect too little of a pupil, it is likely that they will be under-challenged and consequently not achieve as much.

Taking specific actions to ensure that you treat all pupils as individuals and showing them that you have high expectations of them is important. The list below shows some of the ways you can do this:

- Give all pupils the same amount of time to answer questions.
- Positively reinforce answers from all pupils.
- Give all pupils the same opportunities to engage in the lesson.
- Move seating plans around often and keep these purposeful.
- Give pupils the same opportunities for feedback.

The way a pupil views their own ability will be affected by your expectations of them. Self-perceptions are often seen as precursors to motivation: if a child believes in their ability, they are likely to be more motivated and put forth greater effort, leading to improved performance (Education Endowment Foundation, 2019). We will see in future Blocks that part of this is giving children a chance to succeed and experience success.

This doesn’t mean that you should have low expectations. You should set learning goals that will challenge your pupils. They should have a level of difficulty that only makes them achievable with sustained effort. You can support your pupils to achieve these by demonstrating your high expectations of them; show pupils that you believe in them and their abilities. We can support and develop pupil attitude towards challenge (Willingham, 2009). Pupils must be encouraged to persevere, even when they find work challenging, as it is this process that will help them learn. The level of challenge will convey your high expectations to your pupils and when they achieve success in meeting those high expectations they will be motivated to work harder and strive to achieve further success (Chapman et al., 2013; Rathmann et al., 2018).

Look at the following example of a teacher helping a pupil set a challenging goal.

<h3>Example</h3>
Pupil: I want to get better at reading.

Teacher: Ok so let’s have a think about how you are going to achieve that. If I want to get better at something, I know that I need to practise that skill. For example, I really want to learn how to bake bread, so I am going to have a go at doing that every weekend. Would practice help you here?

Pupil: Hmm yes, I think so.

Teacher: Well we know that regular practice is the best way to improve. How often could you practise reading?

Pupil: Well I don’t really like reading.

Teacher: I am really impressed that you have chosen that as something you want to get better at then. You have chosen a challenging goal for yourself, which is the best way to help yourself improve. How will this help you with your schoolwork?

Pupil: I think it would help me in English because I would find the work easier.

Teacher: I think improving your reading would support you in all of your subjects and even outside school as well. We can talk about that a bit more in a minute. Let’s think about how you can achieve this. How about starting with just a short amount of reading each day?

Pupil: I guess I could read for a bit in the evenings?

Teacher: How about we say 10 minutes reading to start?

Pupil: I could do that.

Teacher: How are we going to record your progress?

Pupil: I could write in my reading log?

Teacher: That would be great! So, what’s the goal?

Pupil: I am going to practise reading every evening for 10 minutes.

Teacher: Great. Should we check in again next week and see how you are getting on?

Pupil: Yes, that sounds good.

## Effective relationships are integral to a positive classroom environment

Building positive relationships with the classes and individual pupils you teach is of the utmost importance to both you and your pupils. One of the largest potential mediators of academic outcomes is the extent to which students are motivated and engaged by their interactions with teachers (Allen et al., 2011; Wubbels et al., 2014; PISA, 2015; Valdebenito et al., 2018). When pupils have good relations with their teachers, both their performance and their sense of belonging at school benefit (PISA, 2015). Positive teacher-pupil relations are also associated with higher life satisfaction (Rathmann K et al, 2018) and they can also support the attitudes, behaviours and strategies that facilitate success in school and workplace, such as motivation, perseverance and self-control (EEF, 2019). Secure and positive relationships will also have an impact on the way you feel about your classes and on your own wellbeing. Pupils who want to behave in your lessons, will strive to achieve their best and will be motivated and engaged in their learning.

To make a positive start, teachers need to get to know the pupils they teach, for example by using their names and modelling the respectful attitude they expect in return (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017).

One of the first things you can do to create a positive relationship with your pupils in a new class is to address them by name so that they feel respected and included.

Of course, in order to do that, you need to learn and remember their names, which can be challenging. Here are a few techniques I use to make sure I learn my pupils’ names as quickly as possible:

<ul>
  <li>
    In the first lesson, I ask pupils to tell me something about themselves to
    give me a sense of who they are. This works best if I refer to that piece of
    information when I next address them by name.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the first few lessons, I ask each pupil to display a name card on their
    desk so that I can use their names every time I speak to them, from the
    first minute of the first lesson.
  </li>
  <li>
    I make sure I look at pupils’ faces when I speak to them to help establish
    an association between names and faces.
  </li>
  <li>
    I use a fixed seating plan because I find that knowing where in the room to
    expect a name and a face to be serves as a helpful memory aid.
  </li>
</ul>
Those are the techniques I find helpful but of course there are others. The important
thing is not to leave it to chance, but to plan how you are going to make it easy
for yourself to remember pupils’ names. $EndContent $EndAccordion

While knowing the name of each pupil is a good start, it is clearly not enough! Every interaction you have with your pupils is important as it is these interactions that build relationships. Pupils spend about a third of their waking hours in school during most weeks in the year (PISA, 2015), which means that teachers can become key role models within their pupils’ lives (Johnson et al, 2016) and help pupils form ideas about what it means to be ‘a good person’. This is clearly an important responsibility; you are probably asking yourself how you can best go about it.

Studies show that pupils notice and consider the following things:

- How well they are treated by their teacher
- How well their teacher treats others
- How well they get on with their teacher
- The behaviour the teacher models.

(Lerner & Lerner, 2016)

It is particularly important that you respond quickly to any instances of bullying or threats to emotional safety of pupils in your class. Showing that this kind of behaviour is not tolerated and being clear on the consequences by following your school behaviour policy will help to build pupil trust in you and models your high expectations for behaviour.

The following table shares some of the ways you can build and maintain a culture of trust and respect with your pupils. Read through the suggestions and answer the questions that follow.

## Routines help establish a positive climate for learning

We are creatures of habit. Everybody has routines and we all recognise how disconcerting it can be when these routines are broken. We also know how hard it is to change bad routines once they have set in! The same goes for classrooms. Classroom routines ensure that frequently performed tasks are carried out correctly, consistently and efficiently. Routines represent predictability and security, which help pupils feel safe and confident. It is important to teach and embed _good_ routines as soon as you have a new class. Ideally the routine will become habitual and for this to happen, we need it to become normal and expected in our classrooms.

Watch the video of a teacher talking about how they establish their routines with each new class at the start of the year and answer the questions.

It is really important that I teach my new class the expected routines as quickly and as seamlessly as possible. I am looking for these routines to become habitual for my class, so I need to embed these quickly.
Before I see my class, I make sure that:

<ul>
  <li>I know exactly what routine I want my pupils to do.</li>
  <li>I am clear on the steps of the routine.</li>
  <li>I know why I want pupils to follow this routine.</li>
  <li>I have considered things that could potentially go wrong.</li>
</ul>
I like to begin my routine from the very first time I see my class. This is so that
they begin associating lessons with me as always beginning in a certain way and that
my expectations are clear.

I take steps to explicitly teach my class the routine. To do this I usually:

<ul>
  <li>
    Clearly explain to pupils what I would like to see them doing. For example,
    I might explain that every time I want books or equipment to be handed out,
    I will put a pile on each end of the table, and they will take one and pass
    them on.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will explain the rationale behind the routine. For example, with the book
    and equipment, I would explain that I want to make sure we have the most
    amount of time possible for learning so we are going to be doing this to
    make sure we can begin as quickly as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will make pupils practise the routine until I am satisfied that they are
    clear on what they are doing.
  </li>
</ul>
Throughout, as I am teaching the routine, I will make sure that I model my expectations
to pupils. I will also praise the right behaviours continuously as I feel this always
helps a lot!

Keep in mind that pupils like routines and consistency, they like to know what they are expected to do: so as long as we make this clear and maintain our expectations, most pupils will follow them.

## **Your classroom as part of the wider school culture**

Routines will become part of your classroom culture. You want them to be effective for you and your pupils, but you also have to recognise that your classroom is just one of many in your school.

Good routines should:

- Be in line with your school’s ethos and rules
- Maximise time for learning
- Work for you and for your pupils.

You should always follow your school’s behaviour policy. This is designed to ensure fair and consistent practice across the whole school, and it makes it easier for pupils to comply with expectations. Your mentor will help you implement and establish your own routines, which **fit with the ethos of your school.**

For example, your school policy may be for pupils to line up in silence outside the door before each lesson. Your own classroom routine for the start of the lesson needs to align with the school policy, so you should plan to be outside the door to bring the pupils into the classroom, supporting the school in ensuring a smooth start to each lesson and maximising learning time. Following this, you need to teach your pupils your expected routine for beginning the lesson. Sometimes this will require you to think carefully about how to align what you want with what happens in the wider school:

Teacher: I would like my pupils to get started on the task on the board straight away, but I know I need to follow school policy.

Mentor: Ok so let’s see how we can work this out. So, the school policy says that all pupils should line up outside the classroom before lessons start?

Teacher: Yes. But I would like to have my pupils starting their work quickly.

Mentor: It is really important that all teachers follow the policy. This doesn’t mean you have to change your expectations though. I can tell you want to get pupils started on their work quickly to make sure that you make the most of learning time. Let’s have a think about how you can make the policy work for you.

Teacher: I guess I could be at the door to greet pupils and send them in to get started when they are all lined up?

Mentor: I think that would be a great start. You will be making sure that pupils follow school policy, you have a calm, controlled start to the lesson and then get pupils working as quickly as possible. How are you going to make sure pupils follow this routine?

Teacher: I will explain to them what the routine is and then get them to have a go at coming in and getting started straightaway.

Mentor: Yes, good idea. It is always good to explicitly teach your routine to your class. Can you explain to them why you want them to get started straightaway? Giving the rationale often helps pupils engage with the routine.

Teacher: I will tell them it is to maximise the learning time; the quicker they get started, the more work we will achieve.

| Establishing effective routines                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                         | How can you establish this? |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Develop the simplest, fastest procedure.                                                     | Handing out equipment/resources: the teacher asks pupils to take one book and pass them along to the next person.                                                                               |                             |
| Use practice to establish the routine.                                                       | Follow the same routine every time you want the books handed out, asking them to repeat if it does not meet your expectations.                                                                  |                             |
| Communicate the procedure explicitly and clearly to pupils.                                  | “I want us to be able to start our work quickly and calmly so that means we need to get books in our hands as quickly as possible. You are going to take one and pass it on.”                   |                             |
| Explain how you want the pupils to complete the routine.                                     | “Without any talking, I want you to take a book and pass the rest on to the person next to you. While the books are being handed out, I need to see you facing this way, ready to get started.” |                             |
| Use quick verbal prompts or non-verbal prompts to support pupils in undertaking the routine. | Hold up your copy of the book. Fingers to lips to indicate quiet.                                                                                                                               |                             |
| Use praise to reinforce the expected behaviour.                                              | “Thank you to this table, who got their books handed out so quickly and are facing the front, ready to start.”                                                                                  |                             |
| Practise until the routine is performed efficiently and to a high standard.                  | “I think we can get the books handed out much quicker than that, I am going to time us, let’s see how quickly we can do it.”                                                                    |                             |
| Provide pupils with feedback if the routine is not performed correctly.                      | “One table is talking. Remember this task should be completed in silence so that we can all think hard about the work.”                                                                         |                             |

## **Reinforcing routines helps to create an effective learning environment**

We know from our own lives that establishing good habits and routines can take work. Think about your own experiences of making a positive change like doing more exercise or eating more healthily. You are far more likely to succeed if you plan carefully, thinking about how you will make the change work for you. When you repeat it often enough (practise it) it becomes habit. You’ll also know how easily your good routines can slip.

It’s the same in school. It is valuable to **practise routines at the beginning of the school year.** The time you invest in this early on will benefit you and your pupils in the long run, making more time available for learning. But it doesn’t stop there. If your pupils do not follow the routine, you will need to reteach it. Even a well-established routine needs positive reinforcement and practice. Being consistent will have a huge impact on your classroom.

How do we know we have established our routines successfully?

- Pupils know what to do – and do it!
- Routines are followed consistently and efficiently.
- When routines are not followed, pupils understand what happens and why.

Watch the video below of a routine going wrong and answer the questions.

## Video

### **Title**

Reteaching routines

### **Video type**

Classroom interaction

### **Short description**

Pupils do not follow the required routine (entering the classroom) exactly as the teacher wants, so she reteaches the routine.

### **Guidance**

When routines do not go to plan, they need to be re-taught.

NARRATION
With routines, consistency is key. We should expect pupils to complete the routines we ask of them the same way, every lesson.

We need to demonstrate our high expectations through routines, we should show pupils that we expect them to be completed in a certain way, if they are not then they will need to be redone.

CLASSROOM INTERACTION
When you entered the classroom just now, I saw half the class doing what was asked of them, which was:

<ul>
  <li>Entering the room quietly and calmly</li>
  <li>Taking a seat</li>
  <li>Starting the task on the board.</li>
</ul>
We are going to go outside and come back in and this time I want to see the whole
class following instructions.

Back outside in 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1

Ok let’s try that again. Well done Lydia that is a much better start, excellent.

Callum, I can see you are really focused on beginning the task.

| - Be clear in your own mind what routines entail. - Write down the routine to make it clear. - Clearly communicate routines to pupils. - Model the behaviour you expect from pupils. - Have high expectations of behaviour. | - Ensure your actions match your words. - Always follow the routines you have set out. - Treat pupils equitably. - Maintain your high expectations, even if pupils are not always behaving appropriately. - Always follow through with praise and sanctions. - Be predictable. | - Remind pupils of the steps in a routine using short verbal/visual prompts. - Use verbal and non-verbal prompts such as nodding or smiling, saying thank you and praising those who follow the routine well. - Expect pupils to perform a routine again if it is not performed effectively. |

Lessons can be thought of as a series of activities: pupils coming in, the teacher explaining a new concept, the pupils completing a task. The _transitions_ between these activities are a key area we can address to ensure maximum learning time and to reduce wasted time. Having tight transitions will keep the momentum of your lesson going and avoid off task disruptions. Read through the script to see how the teacher has managed transitions to maximise learning time:

## Praise and rewards help to create a safe, predictable environment

A sense of predictability and security is important in setting and maintaining an effective climate for learning. This is beneficial for all pupils, and especially those with special educational needs, whose learning may be particularly hindered when the learning environment is not calm, secure or predictable. We will look more closely at how to adapt teaching for the learning of all pupils in Block 3. The key to making pupils feel safe and secure is to always be predictable and consistent in your response to pupils.

Have a look at the table below, which highlights some of the things that you can do to create a predictable, safe environment.

| What to do                                                                                                                | How this creates a predictable environment                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Establish routines and stick to them.                                                                                     | - Pupils know what they need to do. - Routines become habit. - Takes away anxiety because pupils know what is expected of them.                  |
| Greet pupils at the door with a smile every lesson.                                                                       | - Pupils will begin the lesson in a positive way.                                                                                                |
| Be consistent in the way you deal with behaviour. Use rewards and sanctions consistently, in line with the school policy. | - Pupils will know what will happen if they do A or B. - Pupils will understand the consequences of their actions. - There will be no surprises. |
| Respond quickly to any behaviour that threatens emotional safety.                                                         | - Pupils will trust that you will deal with anything that hurts them. - Pupils feel safe.                                                        |

A positive, predictable and safe environment makes pupils feel that they are supported to learn, respected and cared for.

You can use praise and rewards to develop a **positive, predictable and safe environment in your classroom:**

- Acknowledge and praise expected behaviour using verbal and non-verbal signals.
- Use in-class rewards and praise alongside whole-school rewards.
- Make praise and rewards ‘high value’: don’t praise work that is not at the standard expected.
- Focus praise on effort and progress, not attainment. This encourages further effort, whatever level the pupil is working at.
- Use positive language to give directions or address behaviour: sanctions are used positively with a focus on returning to learning as quickly as possible.

$I

<h3>Try this...</h3>
Use non-verbal signals to provide feedback about behaviour. For example, in an upcoming
lesson, practise:
<ul>
  <li>
    Using smiles and nods rather than verbal praise for pupils who are following
    your routines effectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Positioning yourself in the classroom near pupils who are not doing what is
    expected.
  </li>
</ul>
$I

By narrating the positive things pupils are doing in your classroom, you can quickly get pupils on task and encourage good behaviour. If you do this every lesson, it will create a positive climate for learning as pupils will expect you to recognise and highlight the good things going on in your classroom. Take a look at the video below to see how you can do this in practice.

NARRATION
Instead of correcting negative behaviour, I want to demonstrate and model positive behaviour. One way of doing this is through praise and verbalising the positive things going on in the room.

CLASSROOM INTERACTION
Mariah, what am I asking you to do in this task? Exactly right, you are going to be working in pairs to answer question 3. Off you go.

I can see that Josh and Harry have made a really great start. Good to see you both on task so quickly.

Who else can I see showing great focus? Thank you Bettie, thank you Catherine. Really focused in this corner here, well done.

Sacha, I see you’re getting started already, that’s excellent. Sophie has settled quickly to work, thank you Sophie, I like what you’ve done with that first sentence.

Jon and Karl are getting books and pens out of their bags. Nice and quickly now thank you.

Maria and Ryan have made an excellent start, well done you two.

NARRATION
By narrating and modelling the positives, everyone will be encouraged to follow the good examples. My high expectations will be evident, and I am more likely to have full co-operation and participation from the class.

It is important to plan HOW pupils are going to do things as well as WHAT they are going to do. You can make this clear when giving instructions. It is important to consider the ‘reasonable adjustments’ you can make for those with SEND, for example a pupil with SEND may need the instructions written down or one instruction given at a time.

$I

<h2>Example</h2>
“You are now going to complete the next part of the story working quietly in pairs.
This means you will only be talking at a whisper and you should not be able to hear
what the pair next to you are talking about and they should not be able to hear you.
You have four minutes to complete this task. When you have finished, you will complete
the extension activity on the board on your own and in silence.

Susannah, how long do you have to complete this task? Thank you, Susannah, four minutes. Kieran, who will you be working with? Thank you, Kieran, you’ll be working in pairs with your partner. Kirttana, can you talk while completing this task? That’s right, Kirttana, you can talk in a whisper. Leo, what should you do if you finish? Thanks Leo, yes, there is work on the board if you finish.

I’ll be coming round to help so put your hand up if you need me. I’ll write the names of pupils who have worked well on the board. Thank you.”

## Escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate ensures a predictable and secure environment for all pupils.

In the previous part of this section we explored the importance of always being consistent when responding to pupil behaviour. We are now going to think about this in terms of poor behaviour. When you are teaching, you want 100% of pupils to be focused, on task and engaged so that you are able to teach and they are able to learn. So, what should you do if a pupil misbehaves? Let’s consider the following key questions you should ask yourself:

- How can I maintain the positive environment I have created?
- What does the school policy say?
- What intervention will be the least invasive and will get the behaviour I want to see?

Knowing the different interventions you can employ, and the order in which to do these is a vital part of dealing with poor behaviour in your classroom. Ideally you want intervention to be fast, invisible and always to use the least intrusive approach possible.

Using the least intrusive intervention allows us to:

- Promote good relationships
- Make pupils feel safe and secure
- Prevent poor behaviour escalating
- Help pupils self-regulate their behaviour
- Maintain the positive climate for learning.

Take a look at the table below to see the behaviour interventions beginning with the least intrusive and slowly escalating as necessary:

| Behaviour intervention          | What is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Non-verbal                      | A signal to pupils to show the behaviour you want to see. You want to indicate that they need to follow an instruction without talking.                                                                                       | - Allows fast, invisible correction - Does not disrupt the flow of learning - Teacher can maintain the pace of the lesson - Addresses behaviour instantly.                                                                     | One pupil still has their book closed: the teacher walks to their desk and taps the table.                                                                                                     |
| Positive group reminder         | If an individual or group are not behaving, you can give the whole group a reminder about what they should be doing.                                                                                                          | - Quick and positive - Corrects behaviour you see and those you don’t - Anonymous and supports positive relationships.                                                                                                         | “You should have your books open.”“You should be reading the text carefully.”                                                                                                                  |
| Anonymous individual reminder   | This is the same as a positive group reminder but you make it clear that you do not have all pupils following instructions/on task.                                                                                           | - Makes it clear that you cannot see 100% - Tells pupils exactly what they should be doing - Anonymous and supports positive relationships.                                                                                    | “I can see 90% of the class on task, I am just waiting on the last 10%.”“I am just waiting on one pupil to look this way.”                                                                     |
| Private individual reminder     | If there is a pupil still misbehaving after you have given an anonymous individual reminder, you should wait till an appropriate moment and go over to the pupil, get to their level and tell them what they should be doing. | - Tells the pupil explicitly what they should be doing - Making it private supports your relationship with the pupil - Does not draw attention to the poor behaviour.                                                          | “When I was talking I did not see your eyes on me. Remember we always have our eyes on the speaker to show we are listening. Can I see you picking your pen up and making a start? Thank you.” |
| Lightning quick public reminder | Give a quick correction directly to the pupil telling them what they need to do and then normalise the behaviour to what the rest of the class are doing.                                                                     | - Limits the attention the pupil gets for the poor behaviour - Tells the pupil what they should do rather than what they did wrong - Needs to be fast and clear.                                                               | “Jack, I need to see you looking this way. Thank you.”                                                                                                                                         |
| Consequence                     | If you have been through the different least invasive techniques and the pupil has not corrected their behaviour you should give a sanction in line with school policy.                                                       | - By using the least invasive reminders first, you have given the pupil opportunity to correct their behaviour - A sanction is not the first choice - The pupil can see the escalation process as a result of their behaviour. | “Ayesha, I need you to move to this seat here to make sure you can stay focused on your work.”                                                                                                 |

Whenever possible, you should try to keep behaviour interventions as low-key as possible and escalate through the interventions as necessary. Your school behaviour policy will give guidance on what sanctions to apply and under what circumstances.

## Area 1: Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions (7c)

### Prepare pupils for an instruction or direction.

#### You should...

- Plan your instructions in advance.
- Have an established quick verbal or non-verbal prompt to bring pupils quickly to silence.
- Monitor and wait for all pupils to respond before continuing.
- Intervene using the [least intrusive intervention](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/establishing-a-positive-climate-for-learning/1-5-developing-your-teaching-your-role-in-establishing-positive-behaviour#LeastIntrusive) if pupils do not respond.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- Aware of the routine, and the majority of pupils are prepared for instructions.

#### What this might look like in practice

- Teacher raises her hand and says: “I am going to count down from 5”, which is the established routine for bringing the class to silence.

- “5…4…making sure you are finishing your sentence…3….making sure you put your pen down…2…making sure your eyes are on me…and 1….thank you….well done this table that is a fantastic response…well done this table you are all looking forward….good I have all eyes facing forward, that’s 100%, well done everyone.”

### Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions for tasks and activities.

#### You should...

Instructions are specific, sequenced and are broken down into manageable chunks. You need to think carefully about the instructions for tasks and activities, communicating these clearly, making explicit:

- The task
- Time expectations
- What resources might be required and how to use them
- How they are expected to work with their peers (e.g. on their own, paired work or in groups).

When posing whole class questions, you are clear about how you wish the pupils to respond, drawing as much as possible on non-verbal or short verbal prompts as opposed to lengthy explanations.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- Understand what is expected of them.
- Begin tasks promptly and purposefully needing minimal guidance on what they are meant to be doing.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “We are now going to move onto the next activity. As you can see there is a worksheet in front of you. In a moment, you will complete activity 1 on the worksheet using full sentences. You are going to do this in pairs, and you will have five minutes to complete it. If you finish before the five minutes is up, you will read your reading book in silence. Let’s do question A together first.”

## Area 2: Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins (7d)

### Ensure all pupils follow given instructions.

#### You should...

- Quickly and accurately gauge the pupils’ understanding of the instruction or direction before they begin.
- Expect all pupils to follow the direction, monitoring pupils’ engagement with the direction and intervening with minimum disruption if required to do so (see [1.4: Learning about… Maintaining consistently high behavioural expectations](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/establishing-a-positive-climate-for-learning/1-4-learning-about-maintaining-consistently-high-behavioural-expectations/)) OR ask pupils to perform the activity again if directions are not followed as desired.
- Adapt swiftly and pre-empt where pupils might find a direction too complex so that learning time is not lost e.g. rephrase or break the direction down further.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- Understand what to do, and follow directions quickly, maximising learning time.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “Daniel, can you explain the instructions back to me?”
- “Show me on your fingers, how many minutes you have to complete this task.”
- “What should the noise level be when we work with our partner?”

**_What other questions could you ask to check the understanding of your instructions?_**

## Area 3: Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions (7e)

### Use non-verbal signals.

Raise your hand when you want silence.

#### You should..

Raise your hand

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- fall to silence quickly when they see the hand signal.

#### What this might look like in practice...

As the activity draws to a close, the teacher raises her hand. She does this a little ahead of when she wants silence, so she ensures there is enough take up time for this to be successful. As the class begins to fall silent, she praises individuals, and this brings more pupils to silence.

### Use non-verbal signals.

Put your fingers to your lips instead of saying ‘shhh’.

#### You should..

Put your fingers to your lips

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- fall to silence quickly when they see the hand signal.

#### What this might look like in practice...

Instead of using ‘shhh’ which increases the noise levels and if ignored undermines the teacher, she instead puts her fingers to her lips to say ‘you need to be silent now’. By not contributing further to noise levels, this helps to bring the class to silence.

### Use non-verbal signals.

Put your hands to your ears when you want pupils to listen.

#### You should..

Put your hands to your ears

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- respond quickly and know that they need to listen next.

#### What this might look like in practice...

This acts as an effective visual prompt for pupils and reminds them that they need to use their ears for listening.

### Use non-verbal signals.

Tap a book open instead of saying open your book.

#### You should..

Tap a book open

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- understand to open their book and noise levels have not been raised.

#### What this might look like in practice...

Again, rather than contributing to noise level in the classroom, the teacher simply taps the book open to show what she wants to happen. This could be done for a variety of things, e.g.:

- Pointing to the board
- Pointing to the bin if a pupil is chewing gum
- Putting a pen down and folding arms to stop pupils from tapping pens during instructions.

### Use consistent language

Use ‘thank you’ instead of ‘please’ at the end of instructions.

#### You should..

- At the end of a command, it is better to say thank you than please as it is more authoritative and less open to interpretation by the pupil.
- Avoid saying “Can you…” at the start of your sentence.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- follow your instructions quickly and with little argument.

#### What this might look like in practice...

“I’d like you to put your pen down, thank you.”

“I’d like you to stand behind your chairs, thank you.”

“Turn around and face the front, thank you.”

### Use consistent language

Count down when you want silence.

#### You should..

- When you have decided you want the class’s attention, use the counting down method to bring the class gradually to silence.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils...

- gradually fall silent with little hassle or having to speak over pupils.

#### What this might look like in practice...

“In a few moments, I am going to start counting down from 5. When I get to zero you will be in silence.

5…4…start to finish your sentence…3…make sure you have put your pens down…2…put your eyes to the front on me…1….well done to X. X, X you are doing that beautifully…And 0…thank you everyone.”

## Area 4: Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption (7f)

### **Non-verbal prompts**

#### Explanation

A quick gesture or prompt (or remind) the pupil of the expected action they should take, given without interruption to teaching.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.

#### What this might look like in practice

- Gesturing a pupil to look at the board.
- Nodding and smiling when a pupil has done what was expected of them.

### Positive group reminder

#### Explanation

A swift verbal reminder of the expected behaviour given to the whole class but providing a prompt for any individual you have noticed that needs it.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “I need all eyes on the board. Thank you, Simona. Looking this way please Ollie.”

### Anonymous reminder

#### Explanation

As above, but this time noting that there are some people who are not complying.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “I need all eyes on the board…I need two more sets of eyes.”

### Private individual reminder

#### Explanation

In this case, you might set the class off on the task and discreetly approach a pupil who has not been complying to give a private reminder of the expectation.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “Jacob, I need to be sure that you are working on this as hard as you can.”

### Lightning quick public correction

#### Explanation

Give a quick correction directly to the pupil telling them what they need to do and then normalise the behaviour to what the rest of the class are doing.

#### If you are doing this well, you will see pupils…

- return back to task quickly with minimal disruption to the rest of the class and learning.

#### What this might look like in practice

- “Anika, looking at the board, just like Mal and Jamie. Thank you.”

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Establishing routines           | - What routines are in place? - Do the pupils follow the routines closely? - What does the teacher say and do to reinforce the routines? - How does the teacher make their expectations clear? - What is the impact on pupil learning?                                               |
| Giving clear instructions       | - How does the teacher make their instructions clear? - How does the teacher check for understanding? - Does the teacher use economy of language? - How does the teacher ensure all pupils get started?                                                                              |
| Praise to reinforce behaviour   | - How does the teacher use praise? - What specific words does the teacher use? - How do pupils react? - What is the impact on behaviour?                                                                                                                                             |
| Verbal and non-verbal reminders | - When pupils start a task, what does the teacher do? - What does the teacher say? - How do they use body language and non-verbal reminders to indicate to pupils what they should be doing? - Where does the teacher position themselves in the room? - What is the impact of this? |

## Why this, why now?

You won’t spend long reading educational research before you come across a version of the statement: good teachers are the most important factor in influencing pupil outcomes. In this Block, you will look at some of the fundamental techniques which lead to effective teaching: presenting things in small steps, high-quality expositions, modelling and worked examples, scaffolding and guiding learning, practice and teaching pupils meta-cognitive strategies. Alongside looking at the techniques and strategies for effective teaching, you will learn about what it means to ‘adapt your teaching’. At the core of this is recognising that pupils, like the rest of us, have differences. It is important to understand that our classrooms are diverse places and it is our responsibility as teachers to ensure that all pupils learn and make progress.

## Your workload

By focusing on doing things which are known to be effective and efficient, you are ensuring that the time you spend is valuable. The most important thing is that your pupils learn, and by using tried and tested teaching methods you maximise the chances that this will happen, saving you time later on when you may have had to re-teach. By explicitly teaching pupils meta-cognitive strategies you are setting them up to be better independent learners. Over time, this will reduce the need for you to provide as many prompts or structures to support their learning.

Adapting your teaching to the needs of your pupils may sound like it will add to your workload, but there are lots of techniques which are effective at streamlining your workload and have an even bigger impact on pupil learning. For example, instead of planning a different resource for every pupil, planning one task with scaffolding to support pupils who need it and being responsive to pupils in lessons, doing small group teaching for example, will reduce your planning time.

## Why this, why now?

In recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation that a teacher’s subject knowledge is critical. There is acceptance in the literature that secure subject knowledge is a defining characteristic of effective teaching. Block 4 has been designed with this in mind and seeks to support you with practical strategies to develop your subject and curriculum knowledge. It builds on everything you have learned so far about classroom practice, how pupils learn and adaptive teaching. Secure subject knowledge will help you motivate your pupils and teach more effectively because you will be able to:

- Better sequence learning
- Anticipate and overcome common misconceptions
- Teach explicitly
- Build a repertoire of strong examples
- Support pupils transfer knowledge and skills more easily.

This Block will also support you to develop your understanding of the importance of literacy and build a collection of teaching skills related to it. Every teacher must take responsibility for improving pupils’ literacy skills in their subject area.

## Your workload

The school workload reduction toolkit section on curriculum planning states that curriculum planning is critical and underpins effective teaching, however it acknowledges that it must be productive and sustainable for teachers. There are five principles set out in that document, three of which are particularly relevant to your locus of control:

1. Planning a sequence of lessons is more important than writing individual lesson plans.
2. Planning should take place in purposeful and well-defined blocks of time.
3. Effective planning makes use of high-quality resources.

This Block will support you to manage your workload by encouraging you to utilise the experience of other colleagues and existing resources. It will support you to focus your efforts on activities that will maximise impact over time, such as developing high quality models.

## Why this, why now?

Assessment is a really important, ongoing process of finding out what your pupils know and can do, where there are gaps and crucially what they and you need to do next to progress their learning. You won’t find a teacher in England that tells you assessment is not a big part of their job. But are they doing it well? What does it even mean to do assessment well? Why is feedback so important as part of the assessment cycle? How often and how detailed should your assessments and feedback be? This Block will support you to establish what effective assessment and feedback practices are. You will also explore questioning as a key tool of assessment.

## Your workload

Assessment and feedback can be onerous and can often have a disproportionate impact on workload. This Block will support you to make assessment less of burden on your workload through:

- Providing strategies to support you in reducing the time you spend marking by marking more efficiently.
- Providing strategies to make sure the assessments you set are purposeful and manageable.
- Working alongside colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment.

## Why this, why now?

At the end of your first year, this Block provides an opportunity to reflect on your learning and successes this year while also helping you look forward and consider how you will continue to develop your practice.

High-quality teaching is vital for the success of your pupils and throughout this year you have been building your teaching repertoire and honing your practice. In this Block you will revisit the ways you can help pupils experience success, influence their resilience, and encourage belief in their own abilities.

You will look at how you can work closely with parents and colleagues in more depth, in order to build a culture of mutual trust and respect to get the best for each one of your pupils. As established in previous Blocks, teachers are a powerful influence on their pupils’ lives. You will consider the successes you have had this year in adapting your teaching to meet the individual needs of your pupils and explore how you can further your understanding of pupil differences.

At this point you will have established yourself in your role as a teacher. This Block will encourage you to look at the wider role you could take in the school community and explore how you can do this successfully.

## Your workload

This Block will support you and aim to reduce your workload through providing:

- An opportunity to reflect on your successes
- Strategies to support you in building relationships with parents and colleagues in order to improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success
- An opportunity to reflect on the way you have managed your workload and strategies to support you with this as you move into your second year.

## Why this, why now?

As you begin your second year of teaching, Block 7 builds on Block 1 to help you embed the strategies you learned around establishing a positive climate for learning. This Block will reinforce your understanding and introduce further techniques to help you in developing a secure, safe and predictable learning environment in which pupils are challenged and supported to reach their potential.

This Block explores the concept of motivation. You will consider the link between maintaining high expectations and your pupils feeling motivated to work hard. Both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and what these might look like in your classroom will be covered. You will find strategies that you can implement to support pupil motivation and help your pupils move from needing motivation from you to being motivated themselves.

You will look at other key ways to establish a positive climate for learning, including through the language you used in the classroom. You will explore how you can support pupils to persevere in the face of challenge and begin to view mistakes as learning opportunities. In particular we will examine the interesting relationship between success and motivation.

## Your workload

The school workload reduction toolkit acknowledges that managing low level disruption and implementing a behaviour policy can increase the workload and pressure on staff throughout the school. Learning about how to embed a positive climate for learning in this Block will reduce your workload because:

- Embedding a positive climate for learning will reduce the time you have to spend on behaviour interventions.
- Being intentional with the language you use will reduce wasted lesson time.
- Strategies to motivate your pupils will mean more on-task pupils and reduce the need for teacher intervention.

## Why this, why now?

By now you will hopefully be able to think about what you want pupils to learn beyond just the next lesson or topic of work. As a teacher you need to be able to keep in mind your long-term, mid-term and short-term learning objectives which link to your school curriculum. If you want pupils to make progress in your subject or phase, they will need to build new learning onto previously taught material. Their knowledge will accumulate over time, becoming more and more rich as it grows.

In Block 2 you learnt about working memory, long-term memory and how to avoid cognitive overload when introducing new material. This Block builds on the knowledge you have developed in this area to focus on how you can help make learning stick over time. As you are becoming more confident with your curriculum and teaching techniques, this Block will help you spot opportunities for incorporating practice and review of previously learnt material into your teaching repertoire.

## Your workload

There will always be times when you have to re-teach something which you taught previously, but aiming to minimise these occasions by supporting pupils to remember previously taught material will help reduce your workload. By incorporating some of the techniques you will explore in this Block into your teaching and planning you will reduce the likelihood of pupils forgetting important information, freeing up learning time in lessons to focus on new material. By making the techniques explicit, you also help pupils to identify and develop effective study techniques so they can be more independent at revision time.

Block 9 builds on the work you did in Block 3 where you focused on pedagogy and what it means to be an ‘effective’ teacher. You also learned about adapting your teaching practice ‘in the moment’ so that all your pupils can learn and make progress. You have had a whole year to embed these skills and no doubt you will have had many successes. Becoming an effective teacher takes time and it is important you continue to practise and improve these core techniques. This Block aims to enhance your understanding of ‘effectiveness’ by moving beyond this repertoire of techniques, where you were mainly focused on your own actions as teacher and how they correspond with your pupils' learning. First, we broaden the range of ways you engage with pupils beyond ‘a pupil’ and ‘the class’ by considering how you can effectively group your pupils to maximise learning and progress. We will also consider what influence you can have on learning outside of school through homework. You will also look at how to adapt your teaching ‘in the moment’ ensuring that you meet the needs of your pupils without creating lots of unnecessary extra work for yourself.

## Your workload

Just as with Block 3, by focusing on doing things which are known to be effective and efficient, you are ensuring that the time you spend is valuable. By grouping pupils carefully and by making the most of out-of-school opportunities for learning through homework, you will support the key aim of the profession: that your pupils learn. Adapting your teaching to the needs of your pupils may sound like it will add to your workload, but there are lots of techniques which are effective at streamlining your workload and have an even bigger impact on pupil learning. For example, making use of existing high-quality resources and intervening within lessons will reduce your planning time.

Block 10 will build on the importance of subject and curriculum knowledge established in Block 4. In particular, we will focus on how more secure subject knowledge supports you to improve the learning outcomes for all of your pupils. You will explore how to support your pupils to build increasingly complex mental models. This will enable you to:

- Develop your subject knowledge
- Support your pupils to make sense of your subject
- Support pupils in learning key ideas securely
- Strengthen pupils’ grasp of subject content
- Help build automatic recall of key knowledge
- Developing your pupils’ critical thinking skills within a given subject area.

## **Your workload**

The school workload reduction toolkit section on curriculum planning states that this activity is critical and underpins effective teaching, but acknowledges that it must be productive and sustainable for teachers. There are five principles set out in that document, three of which are factors which you are able to control:

1. Planning a sequence of lessons is more important than writing individual lesson plans.
2. Planning should take place in purposeful and well-defined blocks of time.
3. Effective planning makes use of high-quality resources.

This Block will support you to manage your workload by encouraging you to utilise the experience of other colleagues and existing resources in preparing sequences of lessons. It will support you to focus your efforts on activities that will maximise impact over time, such as developing high quality models.

## Time commitment

- 1 hour self-directed study materials
- 3.5 hours mentor sessions
- 2.5 hours training sessions

## Why this, why now?

As an NQT last year, you completed Block 5, which introduced you to what good assessment feedback and questioning are. Now in Year 2, we will support you to build on your learning and initial successes by deepening your knowledge in this area and developing further practical strategies. You will go beyond looking at what makes effective assessment to focus on how you can link assessment to metacognitive strategies. This builds on the work you did in Block 3 in this area. You will also look at how to ensure feedback is of high quality: that it is specific, helpful and drives learning forward.

## Your workload

Assessment and feedback can be time consuming; it can be disproportionately so. You will have found ways to make it more manageable in the work you did last year. In this Block, you will be encouraged to work with your colleagues to find more efficient approaches which will support you to manage your workload further. We will also spend some time looking specifically at peer and self-assessment. These strategies are often presented as ways to increase efficiency – however, the time saved is just time wasted unless pupils are doing this really well!

### In this Block, you will learn the following:

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.1 Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2.2 Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas                                                                                   |
| 2.3 An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory                                                                                                                   |
| 2.4 Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded                                                                                                                      |
| 2.5 Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge                                                                                                             |
| 2.6 Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly                                                                                                                |
| 2.9 Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important. |

| Learn how to                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Avoid overloading working memory, by:**                                                                                                                                     |
| 2a Taking into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce                                                                            |
| 2b Breaking complex material into smaller steps (e.g. using partially completed examples to focus pupils on the specific steps)                                               |
| 2c Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content) |

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our memory can be a fickle thing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You might be able to remember the name of the first street you lived on, but
  you cannot remember where you left your keys last night or the name of that
  colleague who introduced themselves to you on the first day of term. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  While it can feel frustrating that our memory sometimes appears only to
  remember useless information, as opposed to the information we really do need
  (
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">where are those keys?),</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  in fact we now know a lot about how the memory works and, importantly for you
  as a teacher, how it affects learning.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitive science </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is the science of learning </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  has come a long way in the past 30 years. Research into the functioning of the
  mind and the brain have greatly enhanced our understanding of learning,
  memory, intelligence and emotion, all of which have fundamental implications
  for education.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  By understanding how the brain works, we can design more effective learning
  for our pupils in terms of instruction, materials, environments and
  experiences.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Psychologists and neuroscientists have known that there are different parts of
  our memory which perform different roles since the 1960s. Very simply we have
  a long-term memory which is where everything we know is stored. Examples of
  this include facts such as your home address or the formula for the area of a
  triangle. Information in the long-term memory is organised into groups or
  “schema”. These schemata are ever-expanding networks of knowledge which make
  up “what you know”. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  When we encounter a new idea or experience it enters our working memory, which
  is a short-term store for information while we are processing it. To help us
  make sense of the new material, we pull relevant information from our
  long-term memory to see if we can connect this new idea into an existing
  schema. If possible, we connect the new content to our existing knowledge;
  this makes it both easier to remember the new idea{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthens the prior knowledge we had. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  So why do some items of information end up in the long-term memory and others
  not?
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there are a few reasons:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      It might be that you didn’t have any secure prior knowledge to connect the
      new learning to and so the new information has nothing to tether it to a
      schema in your long-term memory.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      It could be that you weren’t paying attention or actively engaging with
      the new material{" "}
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      {" "}
      such as that colleague’s name when they introduced themselves.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Another reason might be that there were too many bits of new information
      in your working memory for you to deal with. We call this “cognitive
      overload”.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  All of this is really important to remember when you are introducing new
  content to pupils. Pupils are constantly encountering new material. It might
  seem surprising to you, but pupils’ working memory can easily become
  overloaded and when that happens, no learning will take place. The same
  applies if pupils do not pay enough attention to the thing being taught, or if
  their prior knowledge is either insufficient or{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span>
</i> <i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">activated</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> before encountering the new content.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Luckily, what cognitive science has taught is that there are some
  well-evidenced techniques which you can use to prevent pupils’ working memory
  becoming overloaded such as:
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Introducing new content in small, manageable steps.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Breaking complex material into smaller steps
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Making explicit links to prior knowledge so that pupils can more easily
      connect it to existing schema.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Reducing distractions as much as possible, such as superfluous
      explanations or visuals.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before
      encountering more complex content.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Providing opportunities for pupils to use new content again, spaced across
      the year.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  If you haven’t come across this before it might feel a bit overwhelming to
  have to think about cognitive science and how the brain works at this stage in
  your career, but don’t worry. This Block has been designed to introduce you to
  the most important aspects of how pupils learn and to provide practical and
  easy to understand examples to translate into your classroom practice. This is
  perhaps the most important professional knowledge you need as a teacher{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  if you don’t understand how pupils learn, or what prevents learning, then you
  cannot plan and teach effective lessons. Because of this, you will see that
  many of the ideas and concepts which you will begin to explore in this Block
  are repeated and expanded upon as you progress through the next two years. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You will have plenty of opportunities to work with your mentor to apply the
  learning from this Block into your lessons. And don’t forget, you can always
  ask your mentor what that colleague’s name is!

## Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding

“Much of teaching is about helping students master new knowledge and skills and then helping students not to forget what they have learned.” (Pachler et al., 2007.)

One of the perennial frustrations of teaching is when you think that you have taught something really well and pupils have learnt it as demonstrated in their classwork, homework and class discussions, only to find that they have entirely forgotten it within a few weeks, months or in the worst cases, days.

However frustrating, the fact is that if your pupils do not remember the new knowledge or skill then it is for one reason: it has not embedded in their long-term memory. For students to learn, they must transfer information from their working memory into their long-term memory (Deans of Impact, 2015). Learning is a lasting change in understanding and capability. Understanding how learning takes place, and barriers to it occurring is vitally important for teachers.

## An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory

Both long-term and working memory play important roles in learning.

When we encounter something new which has the potential to be learnt - for example learning about lines of symmetry in maths - it is first processed in the working memory before transitioning into the long-term memory once it has been learnt.

New information that we notice in our environment (e.g. what the teacher is teaching) interacts in our working memory with prior knowledge, which is stored in the long-term memory. In this case, knowledge the pupil has stored in their long-term memory related to symmetry, perhaps from work in Drama on reflections and mirroring, can be pulled into the working memory to support understanding of the new knowledge.

When the pupil learns the definition of symmetry and how to recognise lines of symmetry in shapes this new knowledge will either be forgotten or begin its journey to move into their long-term memory where it can be called upon when needed - in other words it has been learnt.

## Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge

Our long-term memory sorts and stores all information into categories, or schemata (Kirschner et al., 2018). These “interconnected webs of information” group information so you don’t need to remember lots of individual pieces of knowledge.

When the pupil learns about lines of symmetry in maths, their schema on “shape properties” is added to and adapts to absorb the new information. If learnt, symmetry is now stored in their long-term memory. Next time they encounter it, they will be able to pull the learning into their working memory to interact with other new stimuli in the environment and overtime engage in more complex applications of the concept, for example recognising symmetry in compositions in art.

Of course, not all information that makes its way into our long-term memory will be there forever. The reason you may forget something which you previously knew (such as your childhood best friend’s phone number) relates to two things:

- retrieval strength, or how often you access the memory over time; and
- storage strength, or how deeply embedded the information was in your long-term memory including how many schemata the individual item is linked to.

<h3>Example</h3>
In the example below, the teacher applies their understanding of long-term memory,
schema and working memory when introducing new content.
<ul>
  <li>
    How does the teacher help pupils to retrieve information from their
    long-term memory?
  </li>
  <li>
    What techniques do they use to make the information available in the working
    memory for the next task?
  </li>
</ul>
Teacher: “We’ve been reading some really spooky stories and today we are going to
start thinking about some vocabulary we can use when we draft our own scary stories.
Can anyone remember some of the words we found yesterday in our story book?”

Pupils: Scary, Spooky, Mysterious, Monster, Eerie, Twisted

Teacher: “Yes, they’re perfect – they make me shiver! The monster in that story was REALLY scary!

What other scary stories have you read?

Pupils offer Goosebumps as a popular choice.

Teacher: “How would you think of scary words? What could you do?

Pupils offer: think about books they have read at home, movies they have watched at home or pictures they have seen.

Teacher: “Now, have a look around the room and you can see lots of different images which might inspire you. Each table has a big piece of paper. I’m going to give you 5 minutes to work in your groups to think about all of the scary stories you have heard or read before and to list out as many different words which you associate with scary stories as possible. An example to get you started – I know that ghosts are scary so I am going to write that down.”

[Pupils complete the task]

Teacher: “Wow, we have so many amazing words for everyone here! I am now going to put these up on the wall so you can look up and use both the pictures and now our word banks to inspire your writing! Let’s read and talk about them as we put them up”.

## Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded

The implications of how memory works for classroom teaching are significant.

In particular, the capacity limitations of the working memory affect how pupils learn.

As you have just seen, working memory is the _processing_ area of the memory. Unlike the long-term memory (which has infinite capacity to store information), the working memory can only handle a limited amount at one time (thought to be between 5 and 9 items). If a pupil experiences cognitive overload, whereby the amount of information they need to hold exceeds the processing capacity of the working memory, they will be unable to complete the task or engage with it meaningfully.

What you might see in your classroom for a pupil who is experiencing cognitive overload:

- Incomplete recall of instructions
- Missing out or repeating parts of a task
- Giving up as the task seems overwhelmingly complex
- Appears to be inattentive, have a short attention span, and be easily distracted.

(Adapted from Gathercole, et al., 2006)

Sweller (2016) tells us that since working memory has a limited capacity, instructional methods need to avoid overloading it with additional activities and information which don’t directly contribute to the learning. This might include unnecessarily detailed examples or going off on a tangent rather than clearly focusing on the content which pupils need to learn.

There are several techniques which are useful in the classroom for reducing the cognitive load on the working memory.

## **1. Take into account pupils’ prior** knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce and link what pupils already know to what is being taught.

Helping pupils to draw on prior knowledge – linking to existing schemata - when they encounter new knowledge will reduce the burden on the working memory. For teachers this has two implications. Firstly, you should think carefully about what pupils already know about the area of learning. If their knowledge is limited, you should be especially careful when introducing new material and be very conscious of the risk of overloading pupils with too much information. Secondly, you should _link_ the new learning to what you believe they already know. We will look in more detail at the role of prior knowledge in Activity 2.3.

$Content
Pupils have been listening to and participating in a variety of songs and stories on a space travel theme, the initial interest for which was originally observed during free play.

The role play area has subsequently been developed to include a rocket and related resources. The teacher has noted that the children have begun to use previously introduced space travel story vocabulary in their play and are beginning to talk about where they will go on their adventures. The teacher is keen to introduce a new word: future.

This week the children have been reading the story ‘Astro Girl’.

Teacher: This week we’ve been reading ‘Astro Girl’, another space story!
Let’s read it again!

Teacher reads the story in an engaging way, using movement, gesture and varied tone to ensure continued interest. The focus is on the flow of the story and any complex or unfamiliar vocabulary has been previously discussed.

Teacher: So, Astrid wants to be an astronaut in the future. That’s a new word, ‘future’. Does anyone know what it means?

Child 1: I know how to get into the future! We need to go in an electric, really fast transformer car. When we get there, we find treasure. Treasure with food in it!

Teacher: Wow, that sounds really exciting! I know you like cars that go really fast! In this story, Astrid wants to be an astronaut in the future. Future means something that hasn’t happened yet…like when Astrid has grown up.

Child 2: I’m going to be a dancer when I have growed up.

Teacher: I remember your dancing show! The future just means something that hasn’t happened yet but is going to. It can even mean tomorrow. I’m taking my cat to see the vet tomorrow.

Child 3: I’m going to my grandma’s tomorrow.

Teacher: Are you? We’ll that’s in the future! It hasn’t happened yet. Sometimes the future is something very soon but sometimes it’s a long way ahead.

[During free play, the teacher supports the conversation to include the new word and where the children will travel next on their adventures.]

At the end of the day, the practitioner talks to the children about their plans for the weekend again, reminding them that it’s in the future because it hasn’t happened yet. It’s important that the examples given are within the children’s realm of experience and that they hear this word several times to get a clear understanding of it.

## 2. Avoid overloading the working memory by considering how much new material to introduce at one time and breaking complex material into smaller steps.

Another practical way you can avoid overloading working memory is to only introduce new material in small, manageable steps (Rosenshine, 2012). Ensuring pupils master foundational material and that it has had time to embed in the long-term memory before moving on will prevent working memory from becoming overloaded and support pupils to engage with more complex material. This is also true when teaching complex material to pupils: breaking it down and supporting pupils’ working memory with partially completed examples can help avoid cognitive overload.

$I

<h2>Example</h2>
In the examples below, both teachers want their pupils to learn some complex material
about the effects of war on a country. Think about these questions:
<ul>
  <li>Which teacher will be more successful?</li>
  <li>Why?</li>
  <li>
    How does Teacher B take cognitive load into account when teaching the
    material?
  </li>
</ul>
<table width="587">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="587">
        <h3>
          <strong>Example A</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Teacher A teaches the content from the front. They speak for 35
            minutes to cover all of the key factors related to the effects of
            war.
          </li>
          <li>
            The teacher has planned to begin with an overview of the overall
            impact under specific headings (Social, Economic, Political) and
            then work backwards to explain the contributing factors (Debt,
            Displacement, Lack of Education etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            After 35 minutes they pause for questions from the pupils of which
            there are a few, but mostly about the last point the teacher made.
          </li>
          <li>
            The teacher sets the pupils a writing task to describe the main
            effects of war for the remaining 20 minutes of the lesson.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Example B</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Teacher B teaches the same content from the front.</li>
          <li>However, they introduce each factor one at a time.</li>
          <li>
            The order of the content has been carefully sequenced to ensure that
            more complex ideas are only introduced once foundational factors
            have been covered (for example, building up to the concept of
            socio-economic impact only after understanding the effects of debt
            and mass unemployment).
          </li>
          <li>
            After they introduce each factor, they pause, and both take
            questions and pose questions to the pupils. They respond to these
            questions with further explanations and examples.
          </li>
          <li>
            They provide the pupils with a workbook to complete. Each factor has
            a page which has been broken into key categories. For example, there
            is a section on ‘Definition’, ‘Example’, ‘Three key points’,
            ‘Important vocabulary’.
          </li>
          <li>
            The teacher has partially completed some of the boxes, for example
            adding the key vocabulary and pupils need to add the definitions or
            including the definition and pupils need to add the key vocabulary.
          </li>
          <li>
            The teacher gives pupils a few minutes to complete the page in their
            workbook after each factor is introduced before continuing.

## 3. Reduce distractions which take attention away from what is being taught so that attention is focused on the content.

Because working memory is limited, it is important that you avoid overloading it with unnecessary information that doesn’t directly contribute to pupil learning. It can be easy to mistake engagement and enjoyment for learning. Activities must be centered around what we want pupils to learn. While superficially appealing, it is easy to get carried away planning ‘fun’ activities that actually take pupils’ attention away from the content. For example, in a game to complete as many questions in the time as possible, pupils are likely to be thinking about the time limit and how many questions they complete at the expense of thinking hard about the content.

This is not to say that you should avoid planning activities for pupils. You can make learning both active and focused on the content. Consider a ‘hook’ activity at the start of a topic on DNA. The teacher sets up a crime scene and pupils collect clues to solve a Whodunnit. At this stage pupils do not have enough content knowledge to engage meaningfully with the topic, and so the lesson takes time away from understanding the foundational knowledge of this topic. Instead, the teacher could teach the content they need to learn first and then pupils complete the Whodunnit when they are ready to apply their learning to a new context.

Another factor to consider is complexity. If a pupil cannot easily follow the steps of a task then their working memory will be preoccupied with trying to remember what they are supposed to do rather than thinking about the content. Similarly, if a pupil cannot decipher the main point of your explanation their working memory will be distracted by trying to figure out what is important to remember and what is not.

Some things you can do to reduce distractions include:

- Focus activities and tasks on the content rather than distracting ‘games’ which have little to do with the material.
- Ensure that there is a thinking element involved in activities such as ordering, sorting, grouping or matching.
- Every activity should be focused on the content and what you want pupils to learn. If it is not, do not use the activity.
- Consider when you use an activity to ensure pupils have the required knowledge to participate fully in it.
- Minimise the complexity of tasks so pupils don’t need to remember lots of steps.
- For more complicated tasks, write the steps which pupils need to remember on the board and leave them there so pupils can refer back to them during the task.
- Use short, clear explanations and examples to demonstrate your points - plan these in advance so they are high quality and concise.

Teacher: Today we are learning about DNA. DNA controls the colour of our eyes and our skin and other things. We are going to do an activity which demonstrates how the chromosomes work in pairs to pass on information to a new cell. Chromosomes make up our DNA. If the pairs are messed up, that is when we get things like diseases, but they also decide whether we are male or female when we are born because of the X and Y. If you have the same, you’re a girl and different you’re a boy. You’ve got 23 socks in your pile, and I want you to try and match them up as fast as you can to the socks on the washing lines like our chromosomes pair up! Everyone ready? OK, go!

Pupils dash to match up the socks.

Teacher: OK, if I want you to now give me the chromosomes for a girl baby, what would you do?

Pupils show confusion and no answer offered.

Teacher: Today we are learning about DNA. Does anyone know what DNA means?

Pupil: It’s about our genetics so things like our eye colour.

Pupil: I think it’s in our blood.

Teacher: You’re both right. DNA are the molecules which carry our genetic code. This genetic code determines things like your eye colour. Doctors might draw your blood to read your DNA code because it is carried in your blood cells. What other genetic features do you think we get from our DNA? Have a quick chat with your partner to come up with some examples.

Pupils: Skin colour, height, whether you have freckles or not…

Teacher: Great. Let’s look a little closer at what is inside your DNA. Look at this diagram on the board which shows a zoom in of your DNA strand. These thread-like structures are called chromosomes. Each human has 46 chromosomes which are organised into pairs. How many pairs of chromosomes must we each have?

Pupil: 23 pairs of chromosomes.

Teacher: Correct, 23 x 2 = 46 so we have 23 pairs of chromosomes. We receive 23 from our mum and 23 from our dad and they join together to form pairs. One of these pairs will determine whether you are born a boy or a girl. A boy chromosome is called Y, and a X chromosome is female. The chromosome your mum will pass to you is always X (female), but a sperm can carry either an X or a Y so depending on which combination is successful, you’ll be a girl or a boy. Both XXs will be female but an XY will be male. Question?

Pupil: Is it possible to ever have a YY combination?

Teacher: Interesting you should ask… there is a very rare condition…

## Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.

Rosenshine (2012) tells us that “the most effective teachers ensured that their students effectively acquired, rehearsed and connected background knowledge”.

There are two reasons why this helps pupils learn.

The first is that what you learn depends on what you know. Having an extensive and secure background (prior) knowledge helps pupils to integrate new learning into schemata in their long-term memory. This explains why novices (e.g. your pupils with limited schema) find it harder to learn new ideas compared to experts (e.g. adults with extensive schemas).

For example, as pupils move through school, they will encounter many and increasingly complex literary devices. Each time they are introduced to a new technique it connects to existing knowledge and extends and reinforces their schema on ‘literary devices’. For example, a pupil will learn descriptive adjectives in KS1, they will build on this to learn similes in KS2, this will be developed to include metaphor as a concept in KS3 and then building on all of this to understand text level metaphor at GCSE.

The second is that the more prior knowledge a pupil has about a topic in their long-term memory, the more space will be freed up in the working memory to engage with more complex ideas and reflect on meaning. Here’s an example many of us will recognise:

$I
Consider learning to drive. When you first learn you are conscious of every decision; how far to turn the wheel, when to look in your mirrors, how hard to press the accelerator etc. Over time, and with repetition this knowledge is transferred to your long-term memory and you are freed up to use working memory for other thinking tasks, such as remembering a set of directions in a new city. If you still had to use your working memory to figure out what every road sign means, you would likely spend an unnecessary amount of time driving around and missing your turn offs.
(Adapted from Willingham, 2009)
$I

How does this apply to the classroom? It means we need to think carefully about how we sequence knowledge and whether some knowledge is particularly important as a basis for other concepts. We look at this idea of foundational concepts in Block 4. For now, it is important to note that by committing a number of key facts to long-term memory pupils free up working memory to think about more complex ideas. What these facts are will differ depending on the age of your students and the subject you teach.

$Content
Teacher 1: By the time I get them in Year 6, I am hoping that there are quite a few things already committed to long-term memory, especially in the core subjects. It makes Year 6 a lot easier (for me and the pupils) if they are confident, active and engaged readers, with a solid vocabulary base. If pupils can enhance their writing with vocabulary from their wider reading and improve it in the drafting process, their outcomes are more cohesive. Not necessarily subject-specific language which I know they will cover in Year 6 but a broad base. I get so fed up with everything being described as “nice”. There are so many other adjectives out there! It’s also helpful if they automatically use the rules of grammar, such as capital letters, new paragraphs, full stops and the punctuation to demonstrate direct speech. The Year 6 curriculum becomes quite dense with colons, semi-colons etc. which means that it helps if I don’t have to still correct basic grammar they should know already.

Teacher 2: The first thing I do at the start of Year 7 is check how fluent my new classes are with things like their times tables, formal addition, subtraction and written multiplication and division methods. I know I can teach them everything else they need to know but if they don’t have the four operations at their fingertips, it slows everything down and they have to really think about each calculation when I want them to be concentrating on a new idea or concept.

Teacher 3: In Year 2, I know that the pupils don’t have tons of prior knowledge to build on, but I am really aware that I am building the foundations for later. I focus on core skills like embedding phonics and securing the spelling rules, really improving literacy skills so pupils are starting to read more fluently. Automatic recall is key. This means that pupils can focus on comprehension and recall. I also spend lots of time working on basic grammar such as full stops, question marks and capital letters so pupils’ writing can flow. Before I begin teaching this, I will assess starting points so that I am really clear on what pupils can already do.

## Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly

We all understand what is meant by a misconception. It may be a simple misunderstanding. It can also be a faulty belief, where people have come to the wrong conclusion ‒ because of a lack of understanding or having the wrong information ‒ and it has stuck. Multiplying two numbers doesn’t always give a bigger answer (think decimals); heavy items don’t always sink in liquid (think oil); and there are occasions when you can start a sentence with ‘because’.

We also now know that all new learning is related to prior knowledge. Stronger and more developed prior knowledge makes it easier for us to learn new, related things. Where the reverse is true and prior knowledge is weak or shallow, pupils are more likely to learn things incorrectly by forming misconceptions. This is because pupils will form incorrect connections or make assumptions to fill gaps in their knowledge.

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
In the examples below Ava and Tyler have developed misconceptions based on shallow
or incomplete prior knowledge.

As you read, consider how these misconceptions have formed and how their teacher might be able to spot them?

Ava is in Year 7. She loves storytelling and so is excited when her first piece of writing in English is to write a creative story about an adventure three friends go on. When she receives her feedback from the teacher, Ava is upset to see so many corrections circled and that she was marked down for grammar. Ava doesn’t understand ‒ she thought that you used an apostrophe to show that something was plural so she used it throughout her story (e.g. The three friend’s walked quickly towards the bicycle’s which they would use to get away).

Tyler is in Year 1. He has noticed that the trees had leaves which were green during the summer when he played in the park but now that it’s autumn, the leaves have changed colours to yellow and brown! It’s fun because he can kick them. At the school entrance there is a tree which has stayed green which is confusing. It’s a smaller tree though and his teacher told him it was called a holly bush so Tyler assumes that trees can only be trees if they lose their leaves, all the others are bushes.
$I

Your pupils will come into your class with existing prior knowledge. While it’s impossible to know and take into account all the prior knowledge each of your pupils brings, you can safely assume that some of this prior knowledge will be weak or shallow and has already or will potentially lead to misconceptions. This is why careful planning and thought needs to go into identifying possible misconceptions and then planning how to prevent these forming.

In the example above, Ava had insecure prior knowledge about apostrophes before she was introduced to the idea that apostrophes can be used to show plurals. Her existing schemata on grammar and apostrophes was too weak and so she only remembered the fact that an apostrophe is used with an s to show possession. She has extended this understanding and now uses apostrophes ‒ incorrectly ‒ to form plurals. Her teacher might spot the consistent error in her writing and be able to make an intervention.

Tyler has made an assumption about what makes a tree a tree based on his observations and through a partial understanding. Unchecked this could lead to lots of confusion later on. His teacher may not spot the misconception immediately but through further questioning and dialogue they may pick up on his misconception.

There are a few simple techniques which Ava and Tyler’s teachers can use to help prevent misconceptions forming where prior knowledge is weak or insecure:

- Think about what prior knowledge a pupil might or should have before planning to introduce new content:

  - Look at schemes of work for previous year groups
  - Refer to department or phase schemes of work
  - Ask your mentor or another colleague.

- Identify what prior knowledge pupils hold about a topic and how secure it is:

  - Use questioning to get pupils to share their ideas or thinking
  - Ask pupils to write down everything they know about a topic in a mind map
  - Use a short quiz before starting a topic to assess specific prior knowledge.

- Take your time introducing new content, strengthening the prior knowledge:

  - Slow down when you are introducing new content. Take your time to allow for discussion and questions
  - Show how it connects to a previous bit of learning with examples and explanations
  - Include questions which draw on the prior knowledge as well as new content

You will work with your mentor in session 2.2 to plan how to introduce new content when prior knowledge is weak.

## Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn.

Now we understand how the memory works and its role in learning, and the way in which existing knowledge helps pupils to learn new knowledge, we can think about what this means for our teaching. We will look in much greater detail at the types of classroom practice which make learning more likely in Block 3. For now, let’s focus on one area that is particularly relevant to the factors we have been learning about: worked examples.

A worked example is a step-by-step demonstration of how to perform a task or solve a problem. According to Wittwer & Renkl (2010), there is “abundant empirical evidence showing that example-based learning ... is more effective than learning by problem solving alone”. With all tasks we set in the classroom, pupils are likely to perform better if they are shown how to do something, step by step, rather than asked to figure it out for themselves.

## Supporting pupil learning with worked examples

The reasons why pupils learn better with worked examples will be familiar to you now. When pupils are confronted by a new task or problem it places high demands on their working memory. The combination of content information and the need to work out how to solve the task can be overwhelming. If pupils are given worked examples to support them during the process of problem solving, it frees up space within their working memory. This makes them more likely to succeed in the task when they do it independently.

The amount of guidance or annotation you provide in a worked example will vary depending on the context and the levels of expertise of your pupils, but a general rule is that the more novice a pupil, the more complete the worked example should be. As they develop their levels of expertise, gradually reducing the level of supporting information is beneficial for pupil learning.

While a worked example can support pupil learning by easing some of the cognitive burden, their effectiveness is even greater when they are used in particular ways:

- A large number of experiments have demonstrated that pupils learn more when alternating between worked examples and solving problems on their own, so long as the problems are similar to the worked example (Pachler et al., 2007).
- If a pupil actively explains the worked example to themselves (or others) they will be even better prepared to transfer the knowledge to new problems (Wittwer & Renkl, 2010).

You will work with your mentor in session 2.6 on worked examples and there is an opportunity to practise them in the activities below.

## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                             |

| 2g Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed |

There is an obvious link between knowing about how pupils learn and teaching.

Three strategies which the research literature cites as having beneficial outcomes to prevent cognitive overload and transfer information to their long-term memory are:

- [Worked examples](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/how-pupils-learn-%E2%80%92-memory-and-cognition/2-4-developing-your-teaching#WorkedExamples)
- [Helping pupils commit some key facts to their long-term memory](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/how-pupils-learn-%E2%80%92-memory-and-cognition/2-4-developing-your-teaching#HelpPupils)
- [Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so misconceptions can be addressed](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/edt-early-career-framework/self-directed-study-materials/how-pupils-learn-%E2%80%92-memory-and-cognition/2-4-developing-your-teaching#EncouragePupils)

## Worked examples

### Doing this in your classroom will mean…

- Pupils are quicker able to understand a new idea or concept.
- Pupils are more confident to complete a task, using your worked example as a guide.
- Pupils make fewer mistakes when they are working independently.

### Instructions

#### Create an independent (homework) task with worked examples to guide pupils.

- Decide what task you would like pupils to complete.
- Break the task into sections with similar problems or themes grouped together.
- For each section, complete a worked example. Annotate your answer showing the steps you took to complete the task (e.g. “Divide by 2 on both sides to balance”, “underline the adjectives & circle the verbs”).
- Give pupils questions to complete independently and instruct them to use your worked example to guide them.

#### Live model a worked example on the board

- Display a question or task which you would like pupils to be able to complete. Use a whiteboard or a visualiser to work through the example question, verbalising each step in your thinking and process, e.g. “I am first going to draw out the sweets each person has”.
- Do more than one worked example on the board if needed.
- When ready, set pupils some questions similar to the one you have just solved which could be partially solved already to help manage the cognitive load.
- Leave your worked example on the board as a prompt.

## Help pupils commit key facts to their long-term memory

### Doing this in your classroom will mean…

- Pupils will be able to recall a set of facts or knowledge from memory.
- Pupils will engage with complex ideas, drawing on key facts which they have in their memory.
- Pupils will be confident when encountering complex content because they have secure foundational knowledge.

### Instructions

#### Flashcards:

- Create a set of flashcards for the subject or theme with the key facts you want them to learn. You could either create these yourself in advance, or with older pupils create them together.
- Put a question or prompt on one side, and the answer on the other.
- Have a class set or one set per student.
- Pupils can spend time (in class or at home) using the cards to retrieve knowledge. They ask a question, recall the answer and say it out loud, then flip it over to check whether it is correct.
- Pupils should only remove a card from the deck when they have seen it come up three times or more and have correctly answered it.
- Pupils should shuffle the deck in between retrieval practice so the order doesn’t become predictable.

#### Quiz, quiz, trade:

- Plan a set of flashcards which have questions on one side and answers on the other.
- It works well with content you want pupils to repeat a lot (e.g. times tables or quotes from a text).
- Give each pupil a card and ask them to work with a pupil next to them.
- Pupils take turns to ask each other the questions on their card and have time to check the answers with each other (quiz, quiz).
- Pupils then swap cards (trade) and turn around to speak to a new partner.
- To ensure that the focus remains on the content which you want pupils to learn, you might include a capture sheet where pupils can write down their working out or record their answers as they go.
- It might be helpful to have some extra cards ready because pupils will naturally start to circle back to the same cards again so you can quickly swap a card in and out if that happens.

## Encourage pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so misconceptions can be addressed

### Doing this in your classroom will mean…

- Pupils expose existing gaps in their prior knowledge or existing misconceptions before you teach new material.
- Your planning will improve to take into account pupil prior knowledge and potential misconceptions as they are forming.
- You address points of confusion and misconceptions quickly before they take root.

### Instructions

#### Think, pair, share

- It is helpful to set up pairs in advance and label pupils A or B.
- Pose a question to the class.
- Give time for pupils to **think**. This should be on their own. They might write down their ideas or thoughts in their books.
- After a few minutes, ask pupils to talk in **pairs**. Pupil A goes first, followed by B. They should compare answers. Did they agree/disagree?
- During this time, you should circulate and listen in to pairs’ answers to hear what they have understood or not.
- Once pupils have had enough time to discuss the answer in pairs, bring the class back together and call on a few pupils to **share** their ideas from the pair with the class.
- You can use this information to decide what to do next. If there are misconceptions or misunderstandings, you can intervene and maybe re-teach that part. If everyone has understood, you can move on to the next stage of the lesson.

#### Shared misconceptions

- Choose a topic or a concept which you have been learning about.
- Write some multiple-choice question on the topic, including some misconceptions you think the class may have.
- When you have looked at pupil answers identify which of the misconceptions are common in the class.
- Talk it through with the class and dissect the thinking.
- Present it in a positive way to show pupils that uncovering and correcting misconceptions is an important part of learning.
- Use questioning to get pupils to unpick the misconception.
- Ask pupils to then correct their own work.

| 4.1 Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning                                                                                                                    |
| 4.2 Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned                                                                               |
| 4.3 Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible                                                                                             |
| 4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases                                                                            |
| 4.5 Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success                                       |
| 4.8 Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practice, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success                                          |
| 5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed                                                                                    |
| 5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching                                            |
| 5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success                                                               |
| 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils               |
| 5.6 There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial |

| Learn how to                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You won’t spend long reading educational research before you come across a version of the statement:

<em>
  Good teachers are the most important factor in influencing pupil outcomes.
</em>

But what does it actually mean to be a good and therefore “effective” teacher?

Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning. Effective teachers are the ones who help pupils learn something they never thought they could, the ones who help pupils to understand new processes and ideas through well-structured lessons. They stimulate pupils to think hard and their support is well planned and tailored to meet the needs of all pupils so that every pupil experiences success even with challenging problems.

In Block 2, you learned about how pupils learn. You considered what working and long-term memory are and learnt about cognitive load. Effective teachers understand the theory of how pupils learn and apply techniques and strategies which make learning more likely to happen. You explored some of these techniques in Block 2, such as how to present information to avoid cognitive overload.

In this Block, we will look at some more of the fundamental techniques which lead to effective teaching:

<ul>
  <li>Presenting new material in small steps</li>
  <li>High quality expositions</li>
  <li>Modelling and worked examples</li>
  <li>Scaffolding and guiding learning</li>
  <li>Practice</li>
  <li>Teaching pupils metacognitive strategies.</li>
</ul>
We will also be looking at what it means to “adapt your teaching”. At the heart of
this is recognising that pupils, like the rest of us, have differences. It is important
to understand that our classrooms are diverse places and it is our responsibility
as teachers to ensure that all pupils learn and make progress. This is not about
providing different lessons for different pupils ‒ it is about knowing your pupils
and having sufficient tools in your toolbox to be able to respond and meet their
needs.

In this Block you will look at:

<ul>
  <li>How to effectively monitor pupils’ progress in lessons</li>
  <li>
    Knowing when to intervene or adapt lessons “in the moment” whilst
    maintaining high expectations, so that all pupils make great progress
  </li>
  <li>
    Knowing approaches for scaffolding learning for pupils who are making slower
    progress or struggling to engage.
  </li>
</ul>
Becoming an effective teacher is not a quick tick-list of techniques and approaches
you can use in the classroom. Each of the techniques you will explore in this Block
require practice and you will refine them over time. You should be sure to make good
use of the observation opportunities in this Block to both see the approaches being
used by more experienced teachers and to receive feedback as you develop your own
teaching craft. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning

Did you realise that you, the teacher, are regarded as the biggest in-school factor which will influence your pupils’ learning and consequently their life chances?

John Hattie (2009), through a massive review of hundreds of other pieces of research, concluded that the teacher has the greatest school-based influence on pupil achievement. Effective teaching approaches can not only directly impact your pupils’ success in school (OECD, 2015) but will also have a longer-term impact on their attitude to learning throughout their lives. You can transform their knowledge, but also their belief in their own capabilities. You will learn much more about motivation and the impact of teaching on how pupils feel about learning in Block 7.

So what techniques and strategies do effective teachers use? Let’s find out.

## Effective teachers introduce material in steps

In Block 2, you learned that our working memory is a short-term store for the information that you use during though processes (Braddeley, 2003) and that our long-term memory is a vast storehouse where you retain your knowledge about the world (Willingham, 2009). Long-term memory has no known limit to its capacity.

According to Rosenshine:

$I
… more effective teachers do not overwhelm their students by presenting too much new material at once. Rather, <strong>these teachers only present small amounts of new material at any time, and then assist the students as they practise this material</strong>. Only after the students have mastered the first step do teachers proceed to the next step.
$I

In this regard, effective teaching might look something like this:

$Figure
$Alt The diagram is a flowchart showing how a teacher could present information in small sections so that pupils are more likely to understand and remember what is being taught. The teacher introduces a small section of content, explaining the idea and modelling an example.&lt;p>&lt;/p>Pupils independently practise a similar task with guidance and support from the teacher as required, before discussing what they have just learned and explaining it in their own words.&lt;p>&lt;/p>The teacher checks for understanding, using verbal questioning or mini whiteboards.&lt;p>&lt;/p>Once the teacher is happy, they move on to the next section. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-3.2.1-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption
$EndFigure

Consider the following example.

- How have they broken the content into smaller steps?
- How do they make sure that pupils master the content before moving on?
- How has the teacher built up to the more complex task of writing your own sentences?

<h3>Example mini lesson plan and script – Year 2</h3>
Teaching sentence structure.
<ol>
  <li>Starter: introduce the rules of a simple sentence.</li>
  <li>Show a sentence on the board: “The boy threw the ball.”</li>
  <li>Read sentence together.</li>
  <li>
    Model aloud my thinking as I identify the subject of the paragraph.
    <ol>
      <li>
        “OK so we know that a simple sentence needs to contain a verb, a subject
        and an object. I am going to look at the sentence here and identify
        these things.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Hmmm, so I know that a verb is a doing word. So the verb in this
        sentence must be ‘threw’. Am I right? Yes, ‘throw’ is a doing word so
        that is a verb. I am going to circle it to show that it is the verb. Now
        I need to work out the subject. The subject is always the thing or
        person doing the verb so in this sentence the subject must be the boy
        because he is throwing the ball. I am going to underline ‘boy’. The
        object is the thing receiving the action so here it must be the ball. I
        am going to highlight ‘ball’.
      </li>
      <li>“The boy threw the ball.”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Check for understanding ‒ questioning.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Teacher: Michael what three things do I need to include in my simple
        sentence?
      </li>
      <li>Michael: A verb, an object and a subject.</li>
      <li>Teacher: Good. Paula, remind me what a verb is?</li>
      <li>Paula: A doing word?</li>
      <li>Teacher: Abdul, is Paula right?</li>
      <li>Abdul: Yes</li>
      <li>Teacher: Jakob, how do I identify the object and the subject?</li>
      <li>Jakob: The subject is doing the verb and the object is receiving?</li>
      <li>Teacher: Excellent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Task 1:
    <ol>
      <li>Handout sheet with simple sentence examples</li>
      <li>
        Pupils work in pairs to identify the verb, action and subject of the
        sentences.
      </li>
    </ol>

## Effective teachers explicitly link new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned

Another way of reducing the load on working memory is to draw upon schemata in the long-term memory (see Block 2) as this allows information to be processed more efficiently. In other words, if pupils can draw on existing knowledge, it helps them to process new knowledge. In fact, with enough practice, schemas can “become automatic… automatic processing of schemas requires minimal working memory resources and allows problem solving to proceed with minimal effort.” (Kalyuga, 2003)

As you become more experienced, you will be more easily able to link new ideas to previously studied material. This is because your knowledge of the curriculum over time will grow each year as you teach it (more on this in Block 4). You will know what you have already taught and what pupils are taught more widely in the school, meaning you can link current and upcoming learning of knowledge and skills to previous content.

An effective teacher will make this connection explicit, linking new material to what has been previously studied and learned by using some of these techniques:

- **Verbally making the link:** “We’re going to talk about compound sentences today. Do you remember last week when we spoke about simple sentences?”
- **Demonstrating how the new idea links to previously studied material with examples:** “The first step I use is to make sure my sentence is an independent clause which we practised in last week's lesson.”
- **Using “link” activities which remind pupils of the learning from previous lessons:** “You are going to write four simple sentences about your trip to the zoo. First, we are going to make a bullet point list of what to include ‒ you will need 1) subject 2) verb 3) object.

## Effective teachers use modelling to help pupils understand new processes and ideas

When we teach, we ask pupils to undertake tasks. These tasks should make pupils actively process (i.e. think hard about) the material. With cognitive load theory in mind, it is important that we make tasks easy to understand, so that pupils can use their processing power on the content rather than trying to work out what it is they are expected to do.

Providing models is the fourth principle in Rosenshine’s Principles of Instruction (2012). Modelling means showing a pupil how to do something rather than asking them to follow instructions or find their way through a task themselves. Having a whole process modelled means that pupils can concentrate on the really important learning moments.

It is important that your model demonstrates the highest possible standard of what can be achieved and makes it accessible so pupils can reach the same standard.

Here are some ways that you might do this:

- Thinking aloud whilst demonstrating how to solve a problem/complete a task This shows pupils how experts think.
- Using worked examples ‒ provide the solution as well as the steps taken to arrive at it.
- Showing pupils how you expect them to record and present their work.
- Demonstrating how pupils should participate in an activity or use resources.

Teacher: 3, 2, 1… Thank you, Year 5. Now that we can read the coordinates of points on a graph, we are going to plot some ourselves.

[Cut to shot of the board which has an empty X and Y axis. Also possible to use a visualiser instead.]

OK, who remembers the coordinates of this point in the corner where the two lines meet?

Pupil: It is zero zero.

Teacher: Yes, this is co-ordinate zero, zero and this is where you will always start from. To start, I am going to hold my pen on the coordinate zero zero like this.

[Teacher holds marker on zero zero.] The coordinate we will plot is (3, 5). Who remembers which axis the 3 tells us to move on?

Pupil: The X axis, so sideways!

Teacher: Correct. The 3 is first so it tells me to move 3 steps on the X axis. Watch carefully as I move my pen 1, 2, 3. [Teacher models jumping each step and counting out loud as they go.]

Now, I need to move 5 places in the Y axis so holding my pen really steady where I have landed I now go up for 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. [Teacher models pen jumping up 5 steps.] Why am I doing it this way? I know that I should use the values on the X and the Y axes as these two scales represent the values of different coordinates.

I’ve now moved 3 across and 5 up from the starting point of (0,0). This is where I draw my X. It should be in line with the number 3 on the X axis and the number 5 on the Y axis. Look at how I check by drawing an invisible line with my finger to each axis to check.

I’m going to try another one and this time, Ben I’d like you to give me the step by step instructions. How would I plot co-ordinate (4, 3)

Ben: Right – first thing is you have to start on zero zero so put your pen there...

## Effective teachers use good models which make abstract ideas concrete and accessible

$I

<h3>What is meant by an “abstract idea”?</h3>
An abstract idea or concept is one which can be difficult to grasp.

An abstract idea is one which is removed from what you can see in front of you (a concrete idea). Some words don’t actually have a concrete equivalent ‒ e.g. bravery, power, justice or freedom. Some abstract concepts are symbolic, representing concrete things: Whilst seeing 3 coins is concrete and visible, the number 3 is an abstraction. Young children will need to learn about “threeness” from the physical world before they can use it in mathematics.

Expecting pupils to understand what an abstract idea is from its definition alone is insufficient to support their understanding. It might help pupils to understand an abstract concept through a concrete example: a beach can be used as a concrete example of the concept of erosion.
$I

In their education, pupils will encounter many abstract ideas that pupils need to grasp. Effective teachers “use models all the time to provide a bridge between pupils’ current ideas and understanding and new understanding.” (EEF, 2018). Pupils are more likely to retain knowledge if they are given multiple examples.

Models are an essential part of developing and sharing knowledge. Evidence suggests that:

- The ideas that models are based on should be familiar to pupils, as otherwise this can confuse them further.
- It is important that pupils understand how models differ from the idea being taught and learn the underlying idea rather than the model.

The table below shows the different strategies you can use to make abstract ideas accessible.

| Strategy                                                                                       | Example                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using a range of examples to demonstrate the abstract idea in                                  | “Here are three different examples of when someone was considered ‘brave’.”                |
| Facilitate discussion around an abstract idea to let pupils relate it to their own experiences | “When was a time that you felt ‘free’?”                                                    |
| Provide opportunities for pupils to experience an abstract concept for themselves              | “This morning, I am going to give all of the ‘power’ of deciding what we do in PE to you.” |
| Use concrete models or examples to make abstract ideas accessible                              | “We are going to count out the number 12 using cubes.”                                     |
| Provide a graphical representation to make abstract ideas accessible                           | “Take a look at the bar graph to compare the speed of the two cars.”                       |
| Provide a visual example to make abstract ideas accessible                                     | “The pictures in front of you show each stage of the evaporation cycle.”                   |

<h3>Using concrete examples to make abstract ideas accessible</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do objects help to make abstract ideas accessible?</li>
  <li>
    How might this relate to your subject? Is there a physical representation of
    an abstract idea?
  </li>
</ul>
You may want to use a physical object that pupils or teachers can touch and move
to support teaching and learning. These can be powerful tools for supporting
pupils to engage with ideas. However, they are just tools: how they are used is
important. They need to be used purposefully and appropriately in order to have
an impact. Teachers should ensure that there is a clear rationale for using a
concrete example to teach a specific concept. The aim is to use these to reveal
structures and enable pupils to understand the subject independently.
<h4>
  <b>Maths example </b>
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Cuisenaire rods</li>
  <li>Dienes blocks.</li>

<h4>
  <b>Concrete examples in use</b>
</h4>
The teacher wants to show an abstract rule (10t – t = (10 – 1)t = 9t) through a
concrete example.

A teacher said, “Give me a two-digit number ending in 0.”

A pupil said, “Forty.”

The teacher said, “I’m going to subtract the tens digit from the number: 40 – 4 gives me 36.”

The pupils tried this with other two-digit numbers ending in 0 and discovered that the result was always a multiple of 9.

The teacher said, “I’m going to use multilink cubes to see whether this will help us see why we

always get a multiple of 9.”

The teacher made four sticks of 10 cubes each. “So here is 40. What does it look like if we remove 4 cubes?”

A pupil came to the front of the classroom and removed 4 cubes.

“How else could you do it?” asked the teacher.

Another pupil removed 4 cubes in a different way.

  height="200"
/>

A pupil said, “Ah yes! If we take away one from each 10 then we are left with four 9s.”

Another pupil said, “And if we started with 70, we’d have 10 sevens take away 1 seven is 9 sevens.”

The teacher wrote:

40 – 4 = 10 × 4 – 1 × 4 = 9 × 4

70 – 7 = 10 × 7 – 1 × 7 = 9 × 7

The pupils discussed what was going on here, before the teacher concluded with the generalisation:

10t – t = (10 – 1)t = 9t

<h3>
  <b>Using modelling to make abstract ideas accessible in Year 4</b>
</h3>
In a Year 4 lesson pupils are learning about discrimination. The teacher has planned
three different ways they will model the concept of discrimination during the lesson.
<ul>
  <li>
    How do you think this modelling will help pupils to understand what
    discrimination is?
  </li>
  <li>
    How does modelling help to make an abstract idea accessible for their
    pupils?
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    As pupils enter the room, those whose names start with A‒M get a high-five
    and are told to take their seat.
  </li>
  <li>Ask any pupils whose names start with N–Z to stand at the back.</li>
  <li>Explain that it is a new school seating strategy.</li>
  <li>
    Ask other pupils: Is this fair? How does it feel to be treated this way?
  </li>
  <li>Ask pupils to take their seats and start the lesson.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Show pupils a picture of a segregated bus in America, 1950s.</li>
  <li>
    Explain that this was a real policy and that black people were forced to
    ride on the back of the bus in America.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain this is a type of discrimination whereby somebody is treated
    unfairly because of a particular characteristic – in this case the colour of
    their skin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Facilitate a discussion on types of discrimination pupils have heard about
    or seen and generate a class list.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity 3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Present a newspaper report about discrimination on the board.</li>
  <li>
    Read it aloud and teacher identifies why this person has been treated
    unfairly and what characteristic they are being discriminated for (e.g. a
    woman being paid less for the same job as a man).
  </li>
  <li>
    Hand out newspaper clippings and pupils work in pairs to identify first
    whether this is discrimination and second what type of discrimination is
    taking place.
  </li>
</ul>

## Effective teachers use guides, scaffolds and worked examples to help pupils apply new ideas

### Guidance

Pupils benefit from guidance when applying new ideas. The most effective teachers often spend longer guiding practice of new material than less effective teachers. When guided practice is too short, pupils make more errors during independent work.

Teachers can guide pupils as they rehearse new content by:

- Asking questions to check for understanding (“What do you understand about X?”)
- Asking pupils to summarise key points (“Can you tell me the main reasons why?”)
- Supervising pupils as they practise a new skill (“Let me watch you try.”)
- Giving immediate feedback, correcting errors (“I notice you have used X and it is resulting in Y. Try this instead.”).

Initially this guidance is likely to come from the teacher, but our ultimate aim is for pupils to be able to practise and perform a skill independently. As pupils undertake guided practice and move towards independent practice, resources (such as graphic organisers, pictures, tables, graphs and charts) and teacher action (such as the questioning shown above) can provide them with additional support or guidance without the need to rely so heavily on the teacher. Our task is always to move them from where they are to where they need to be.

### Scaffolds

$I
The metaphor of scaffolding is derived from construction work where it represents a temporary structure that is used to erect a building. In education, scaffolding refers to support that is tailored to students’ needs.

(Van de Pol, J., Volman, M., Oort, F., &amp; Beishuizen, J. (2015)
$I

You put up scaffolds all the time when you are teaching. Think of a time when you have asked a question, and a pupil has expressed confusion. You don’t just move on; you ask another question which re-phrases the question or you point them to a previous example which will help them. These informal teaching moments when you guide pupils through new learning are examples of scaffolding.

You can also plan scaffolds in advance of a lesson. This could be in how you present new information, breaking it down into steps as we saw earlier in this section. It could also be by providing a framework for pupils to follow, which supports them to apply a complex skill with support.

Whenever we design a task or activity, we need to consider which resources might help to purposefully scaffold pupils' learning, whilst still ensuring they engage cognitively with the content. We can also encourage pupils to think about and explain their own levels of understanding before starting on a task. Developing pupils’ ability to reflect in this way may mean that less time needs to be spent on diagnosing who needs what support (Van de Pol et al., 2015).

You can use this series of questions to help guide your decisions:

1. Who would benefit from resources/scaffolding, e.g. the whole class or certain individuals?
2. In which part(s) of the lesson are resources required, e.g. as part of instruction/for guided practice/for independent work?
3. What resources would be most appropriate and effective to facilitate learning, e.g. physical resources/written prompt/visuals?
4. How and when will you withdraw the scaffolding if you need to?
5. How will you assess whether continued support is needed?
6. How will you ensure you don’t over-support or over-scaffold?
7. How will you encourage pupils to reflect on their own learning and strengths/weaknesses?

The following examples show this in practice:

Pupils affirm, holding up their letter cards.

Teacher: Before I give you the statement, a reminder that you <i>must</i> use the sentence stems to structure your conversation. It starts with person A saying, “This makes me think about…”, then person B responds,“That’s interesting, I wonder if…” and person C, your sentence stem is, “Building on your points, I’m thinking about…”

Teacher: Your first statement to discuss is, “Our differences make us interesting.” OK, person A off you go.

[Pupils begin discussing. Camera pans in on one group.]

Pupil A: Emmm… this makes me think about… differences which we have from each other. Like our hair colour and our skin colour. We look different from each other.

Pupil B: That’s interesting! I wonder if we were all the same would it be fun or boring? We would be like twins so we all look the same and act the same, like robots!

Pupil C: Building on your points, I’m thinking about how it is interesting to see different people. How would your mummy know it was you if we all looked the same?

Teacher: Some really great conversations there. I liked Georgia’s question about how our mummies would recognise us if we were all the same. Let’s explore that…

You can also use resources to scaffold learning. These can include pictures, graphic organisers, charts and graphs which can all help guide pupil thinking.

### Worked examples

Worked examples are another great way of helping pupils to apply new ideas. You explored these in depth in Block 2 and they can be thought of as a tool for scaffolding and guiding student practice. By showing each step of a solution, you free up pupils’ working memory so that they can focus on the content and new ideas.

Remember, worked examples should be planned in advance so you can be sure to explain each step in as simple and coherent a way as possible.

You could:

- Complete a worked example on the board before setting pupils independent questions
- Include worked examples at the start of homework or independent tasks for pupils to refer back to
- Ask pupils to come to the board to work through an example, discussing their process as they go.

## Effective teachers realise that practice is an integral part of effective teaching

As noted by McNamara (2010), “there is an overwhelming assumption in our educational system that the most important thing to deliver to students is content.” (McNamara in Dunlosky et.al., 2013) Teachers tend to place a premium on content delivery instead of supporting pupils to practise applying new ideas effectively.

Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success. Remember that practice is an important aspect of learning, but not all practice is equally important (Deans for Impact, 2015).

During the initial stages of learning it is vital that pupils experience success. This will be motivating and will ensure that pupils continue to try which is the basis for deepening and extending their understanding. We can help pupils to be successful by:

1. Preparing pupils for practice ‒ ensuring we have clearly communicated what it is we expect them to do through high quality instructions and modelling.
2. Monitoring pupils as they practise ‒ checking for understanding and intervening where required.
3. Using verbal feedback during lesson in place of written feedback after lessons where possible.

Breaking a complex skill or procedure into smaller parts also enables us to pinpoint more specifically where in the process pupils are making mistakes; in isolating each step, we can identify the exact point in a process that pupils are going wrong and provide feedback at the point in time where it will make the greatest difference.

You will look at “Retrieval practice” specifically in Block 8.

## Effective teachers recognise that support should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases

The levels of support discussed above should not be maintained forever. You won’t be following your pupils into their exams or beyond the school gates, so at some point you need to begin gradually removing support.

The importance of this gradual removal of support is reinforced by the research where “strong evidence has emerged that the effectiveness of these techniques depends very much on levels of learner expertise. Instructional techniques that are highly effective with inexperienced learners can lose their effectiveness and even have negative consequences when used with more experienced learners. We call this phenomenon the expertise reversal effect.” (Kalyuga, 2007)

The “guidance fading effect” tells us that novices require high-levels of guidance during the early stages of learning, whereas for experts, such detailed guidance is unnecessary, or redundant, and could even be counter-productive.

As pupils develop expertise, we need to make sure we continually increase the challenge and reduce the amount of guidance we are giving them. Although we will need to fade guidance for different pupils at different rates, it is essential that all pupils reach this stage eventually.

$Figure

The stages listed are:&lt;p>&lt;/p>Teacher instruction. Heavy guidance. Light guidance. Minimal guidance.

$EndFigure

There are a number of ways that we can fade our guidance, e.g.:

- Gradually removing scaffolding from activities and tasks so that pupils complete activities with greater independence.
- Reducing the amount of guidance provided by the teacher or other adults meaning that pupils are increasingly required to draw upon their own developing knowledge to make sense of material.
- Combining steps or teaching material in larger “chunks” so that pupils understand how ideas link together and begin to perform procedures in their entirety.

| Pupils need to identify metaphors and similes in a piece of text.              | Pupils have a checklist to complete with definitions of metaphors and similes and one of each identified in advance.                                                                              | Pupils do the task without support.                               |
| Pupils need to complete a piece of extended writing on the Battle of Hastings. | The teacher models “What a Good One Looks Like” on the board using a shared writing technique. Shared writing is where the teacher works with the class to produce a model version of the answer. | Pupils complete the task with the support of some sentence stems. |
| Pupils need to complete a certain number of maths problems.                    | The teacher and teaching assistant sit with specific groups and complete worked examples on a mini-whiteboard.                                                                                    | The teacher and teaching assistant circulate during the activity. |

As we have already considered, the ultimate aim is for pupils to be able to perform a skill or apply their learning independently. We need to make this aim clear to our pupils and encourage them to strive towards independence and mastery but recognising that scaffolds and supports help them on the way.

Why does metacognition support pupils in becoming better learners? $CTA

## Effective teachers understand the value of teaching metacognition

According to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), there is a strong body of research that demonstrates the importance of metacognition and self-regulation for effective pupil learning. The EEF Teaching and Learning Toolkit rates metacognition and self-regulation as a “high-impact, low-cost approach to improving the outcomes of disadvantaged learners.” (EEF, 2019)

$I

<h3>What is metacognition?</h3>
Metacognition is about the ways learners monitor and purposefully direct their learning.

For example, having decided that a particular cognitive strategy for memorisation is likely to be successful, a pupil then monitors whether it has indeed been successful and then deliberately changes (or not) their memorisation method based on that evidence.

By metacognitive strategies, we mean the strategies we use to monitor or control our cognition, such as checking that our memorisation technique was accurate or selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy for the task we are undertaking.

Education Endowment Foundation (2017) Metacognition and Self-regulated learning Guidance Report. [Online] Accessible from:<a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/"> https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/</a>
$I

Effective metacognitive strategies get learners to think about their own learning more explicitly, usually by teaching them to:

- Set goals
- Monitor their learning
- Evaluate their own academic progress.

A simple way to think about metacognitive strategies is how well a pupil is able to recall learned processes to solve challenges. For example, if a pupil is reading and comes across an unfamiliar word, they might have learned the following strategy they can employ:

- Break the word down.
- Read the sentence again and consider the context.
- Consider what definition would make sense.
- Look up the definition to check they are right.

This strategy can be drawn upon any time a pupil comes across an unfamiliar word. Metacognitive thinking such as this helps pupils work out what is effective and what isn’t. Explicitly teaching metacognition not only helps the pupils with individual tasks but also helps them become more efficient learners who are able to make more progress.

### Figure 1: The Metacognition Cycle

You explored how pupils learn in Block 2. Metacognitive strategies will help your pupils to become aware of how their learning is going. When new content enters their working memory, they are consciously processing new material. This process can be monitored through metacognitive approaches, such as asking:

- “Do I know what this word means?”
- “Do I need to change my approach here?”

This helps pupils to identify what they know and, importantly, what they do not know.

Consider the following example:

- What does Freya do which suggests she is a successful self-regulated learner?
- What is the impact of her metacognitive strategies?
- Why are these important?

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
Freya fiddled with her pencil case. Every Friday, she would experience a quiet dread
when facing the weekly spelling test.

This week, though, she felt more confident than before. After a couple of weeks characterised by annoying mistakes, she had worked hard in readiness for this week’s test. She had devised two of her own mnemonics and she had practised her “le” ending words, as well as “surprise’ with an ‘r’”, repeatedly.

As Mr Thomas began the spelling test, Freya listened hard. She knew that sometimes she would feel a little pressure when her teacher moved quickly onto the next spelling, but that this week she would listen carefully and remember what she had practised. One or two words were no doubt tricky, but Freya had weighed up her options each time and she was utterly confident of her success.

Before Mr Thomas had a chance to cycle through the correct spellings, Freya sat up straight, with a smile lighting up her face, fueled by quiet satisfaction. She had already thought about her new spelling routine and how she would stick to it next week too.
$I

Let’s take a closer look at Freya’s process. She:

- utilised cognitive strategies, like using mnemonics and doing some self-testing practice at home.
- used metacognitive strategies to plan her spelling practice, recognising why using a mnemonic was the right tool for the job, whilst monitoring her own difficulties with time pressures during the test.
- drew on motivational strategies to engage in repeated practice and to persevere during a pressured challenge.

(EEF, 2017)

Freya has been taught these strategies, rather than acquiring them by chance and is therefore able to employ them effectively. It is likely that she has gone through a few different processes and this has become a repertoire she can draw on. As the example demonstrates, her confidence increases which will be of benefit in future tasks. So how should we go about teaching metacognitive strategies to our pupils?

- **Make sure pupils know** what they are and why they are important. Muijs & Reynolds (2018) tell us that “pupils need to know why they are learning metacognitive skills, otherwise they lack the motivation to use them”.
- **Teach metacognition explicitly.** The EEF (2017) suggest that we should “explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate their learning.” A series of steps — beginning with activating prior knowledge and leading to independent practice before ending in structured reflection — can be applied to different subjects, ages and contents.
- **Embed metacognition within subject teaching.** Muijs & Reynolds (2017) also suggest that “metacognition shouldn’t be taught as a standalone skill, or in separate lessons, but needs to be embedded in subject teaching.” This is because the strategies are often task or subject specific.
- **Make sure pupils have strategies “to hand”.** Remind pupils to use the strategies you have taught them and use questioning and feedback to push them towards better use of them.

The table below shows how teachers can help reinforce metacognition and reflection by prompting pupils in this way, using the example of drawing or painting a self-portrait in art:

|              | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | How?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plan**     | This encourages pupils to think about the purpose of their learning and about how they will go about the task. Pupils need to understand the goal, activate relevant prior knowledge, select appropriate strategies, and consider how to allocate their effort. | What resources do I need to carry out a self-portrait?Have I done a self-portrait before and was it successful?What have I learned from the examples we looked at earlier?Where do I start and what viewpoint will I use? Do I need a line guide to keep my features in proportion? |
| **Monitor**  | This emphasises the need, whilst undertaking the task, for pupils to assess the progress they are making. This could include self-testing and self-questioning activities and then making changes to their chosen strategies.                                   | Am I doing well?Do I need any different techniques to improve my self-portrait?Are all of my facial features in proportion?Am I finding this challenging?Is there anything I need to stop and change to improve my self-portrait?                                                   |
| **Evaluate** | This appraises the effectiveness of their plan and its implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                          | How did I do?Did my line guide strategy work?Was it the right viewpoint to choose?How would I do a better self-portrait next time?Are there other perspectives, viewpoints or techniques I would like to try or find out about?                                                     |

## Pupils learn at different rates

One of the greatest joys of teaching is getting to know your pupils and what makes them unique. These differences will range from their levels of motivation, attitudes towards school and learning to more fixed variables such as their ethnicity or gender. Some of these factors you can influence, and some of them are outside of your control.

Some of these differences and personality traits will affect pupil learning and success in the classroom. For example, a particularly shy pupil may find it difficult to participate in groupwork and will not be forthcoming to let you know when they are struggling with something. Knowing that this pupil is shy means that you can make a particular effort to check on them during tasks. Pupils who have low levels of intrinsic motivation might need support in the form of encouragement to help them develop this trait.

Good teaching has the potential to lead to good results for most pupils providing they also put in the effort. It is worth remembering that there are factors which may make a difference to how pupils learn, e.g. particular Special Educational Needs such as:

- Communication and interaction
- Cognition and learning
- Behaviour, emotional and social development
- Sensory and/or physical.

(Davis et al., 2004)

Of course, teachers can certainly impact positively on pupils with special educational needs but there may be particular barriers to learning which affect their ability to make progress. In Block 6 you will spend more time working with your SENCO to understand these barriers.

As a consequence of this array of differences, pupils are likely to learn at different rates and require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed. Pupils need to be treated as individuals and a certain level of personalisation to their education is likely to be beneficial. Your task as a teacher is to work out how to do this in a way which is optimal in terms of pupil learning within the realities of teaching 30 pupils in each class.

## Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching

Understanding pupil differences is fundamental to good teaching. There are a number of ways to go about doing this:

- Your school will hold information on all its pupils. There is much useful information that can be gathered to inform your approach for each pupil. There will be data on previous performance, attendance, punctuality and so on. This can help you build a picture of your pupils but be aware of its limitations as the data does not tell you _why_.
- Whilst this information is useful, it is very important to not build preconceived ideas of what a pupil will be like. It is important to retain high expectations of all pupils.
- There will be colleagues in the school who know these pupils very well and understand what their barriers to learning might be. These colleagues can be a useful place to find information. In primary, talking to the teacher who taught your class the previous year will be an important part of the handover process, but you should feel that you can continue to ask more experienced colleagues for advice throughout the year. In secondary, it is likely that your school has a “tutor” system. Often the tutor or head of year/phase will know a lot about a pupil.
- Understanding levels of prior knowledge can be sought through speaking to pupils’ previous teachers and looking at their test scores from the previous year. You will also have a role to play lesson by lesson in understanding levels of prior knowledge by using formative assessment. You will learn more about this in Block 5 on Questioning, assessment and feedback.

Before I meet my new class, I go through the data available from the previous teacher. This tells me some information, such as who used to arrive late every day or who has an EHC plan in place. I like to talk to the teacher if possible, as well to get their take on the class and if there was a teaching assistant who worked in the classroom last year they usually have some great information. If I know before the end of the year which class I am taking, I find it really helpful to look at samples of their work from the end of the year. This shows me what they could do and where there may be gaps in their prior knowledge.

When I plan for the first day I always start by saying that whoever they were last year doesn’t matter to me. If they were the pupil who got the most behaviour points, I don’t care, because this is a fresh start. I like to create a space where pupils can choose to be the best versions of themselves and what better than a new teacher and new class. Through the first half term I plan lots of activities which are “class bonding” but are really designed for me to get a better understanding of who they are and how they work. For example, we do an afternoon of problem-solving activities which is really fun but I am actually observing their communication, reasoning, literacy and maths skills so I can decide which groups to organise pupils into for our first topic.

## Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.

Watch the following video. You will notice that the pupils have all been given the same task. This is not because the pupils are of the same ability. Carefully consider the actions of the teacher. Bring your notes to Mentor Session 6 where you will discuss them.

Assertive monitoring

### Video type

Classroom practice

### Short description

The pupils have all been given the same task. This is not because the pupils are of the same ability.

### What should you focus on in this video?

- What is the teacher doing in the lesson to maximise each pupils’ progress during their independent practice?
- What did the teacher need to think about or prepare before the lesson in order to do this?
- What happens when the teacher notices that a pupil is struggling?
- What is the impact of the strategy?

The teacher starts by giving an explanation of the task that the pupils are going to do. All pupils have the same task. It is not obvious from the video what the range of ability is within the classroom. The teacher lets the class know how many minutes they have to complete the task.

She then sets the class off on the task.

Immediately she begins to circulate the pupils. She checks on individual pupils by looking over their shoulder at what they are doing. She offers short prompts and interventions where necessary. She narrates out loud what she is doing to the whole class and then targets additional support at specific pupils.

“I am coming round now checking on… I will tick it if correct, I’ll put a dot if it’s not.”

Teacher circulates the class and goes to one table at the front:

“Is everyone happy with the task? Any questions?” No. Teacher ticks or dots their work.

To the whole class:

“I am now coming round checking X part of your work...”

Teacher approaches an individual pupil and reads their work.

(Quietly) “This is excellent Rahim, just fix this part…”

You will have the opportunity to practise this technique in Activity 3.5.

## Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils

Until quite recently the prevailing trend was to create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils within the classroom as a differentiation technique, e.g. the teacher producing multiple versions of the same worksheet. Not only did this approach affect teacher workload, activities of this kind can place limits on pupil achievement.

Other popular differentiation strategies were to differentiate by time and differentiate by outcome.
With these strategies, teachers had different expectations of what pupils could complete in the allocated time and to what standard. A consequence of this was a lowering of expectations of what pupils could and should achieve.

Your approach should be to have high expectations of every child, looking for ways to support each of them step by step to achieve the learning objectives.

## There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.

Learning styles theory was popular in education for some time with many people believing that individuals had a preferred learning style (e.g. auditory, visual, kinesthetic) and that pupils would learn better if taught in that predominant style. This is not supported by any credible evidence (Willingham, 2010) and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.

What is true is that learners are different from each other, and that these differences can affect their performance.

$I

<em>
  In claiming that learning styles do not exist, we are not saying that all
  learners are the same. Rather, we assert that a certain number of dimensions
  (ability, background knowledge, interest) vary from person to person and are
  known to affect learning. The emphasis on learning styles, we think, often
  comes at the cost of attention to these other important dimensions.
</em>
<p style="text-align: right;">(Willingham, 2010)</p>
$I

Things to watch out for:

- Being told that a pupil “learns best kinesthetically” and therefore should be allowed to wander around the classroom when they feel like it. There is very little evidence of successful interventions based on learning styles theory. (Willingham 2004)
- Activities which claim to exercise pupils’ multiple intelligences, such as getting pupils to sing and dance when reciting times tables. Gardner (1995) describes such use of multiple intelligences as trivial. This is trivial because pupils are not really engaged in the thing they need to think hard about.
- A colleague gives you advice to prepare three different versions of the same worked example, one which uses pictures, one which uses words and one which includes a video recording of yourself completing it so pupils have “choice” about how to study. Do not spend your time creating these resources ‒ one quality resource (e.g. talking pupils through a written example) will be better.

## Area 1: Using high-quality models

### By trying this activity, you will…

Learn that:

- 4.3 Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.
- 4a. Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain.
- 4i. Narrating thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working independently and drawing pupils’ attention to links with prior knowledge).
- 4j. Making the steps in a process memorable and ensuring pupils can recall them (e.g. naming them, developing mnemonics, or linking to memorable stories).

### If this is successful, you will see…

- Pupils having a clear grasp of what they need to do
- Pupils able to ‘get on’ with tasks with success

### Practise…

#### Using a pre-prepared model answer

Choose a lesson where you will ask pupils to complete an independent piece of work, e.g. an exam answer or extended piece of writing.

For example, you may want pupils to complete a GCSE exam answer which requires extended writing. Use the mark scheme to write a model response which allows the pupils to see what is required. For GCSE and A-level, the exam boards often produce ‘Examiners Reports’ which contain real student responses to questions. It can be useful to share pre-prepared responses that are different levels of quality – support pupils to be able to differentiate between what high-quality and low-quality look like. Something you can do is to ask pupils to re-write a poorer-quality response using a higher-quality response as a guide.

A top tip is to make sure you save the pre-prepared models that you develop so that you can use them in future years/classes. Another thing you can do is to photocopy/scan good quality responses produced by your pupils which you can use with other classes in future years.

#### Narrate your thought process

Narrating your thought processes when modelling can help to make explicit how experts think - remember you are trying to move your pupils from novice to expert. This should allow pupils to see the steps you take, but also the kind of metacognitive strategies you use.

Examples of times you might to do this:

- Completing a piece of extended writing
- Revising a piece of writing
- Balancing an equation
- Completing an experiment in science.

You could either do this on the board or using a visualiser.

Look at the following modelled example which has been broken down into sections to help you.

$I

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Task: Mason and Jasmine have £5 between them. Mason has 90p more than Jasmine.
  How much money does Jasmine have? 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Okay so this is a tricky one. So firstly I need to think about how we have
  solved equations like this before and choose the best strategy. I know that
  word problems can often be solved by expressing them as equations….so I am
  going to start with writing out the problem as an algebraic equation. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Has this helped me? Yes, it now looks like the type of problem I’m familiar
  with. I can now have a go at working it out.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  So £5 is 500p which will be easier to work with.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Firstly I need to take the extra 90 away so 500-90=410
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Now I need to divide this by 2 so 410%2=205
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I know that one of the answers is 205.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I need to add the extra 90 to 205</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">205+90=295 </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  To check my answers I can put my answers into the word problem to see if they
  work.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So now I know that: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine has £2.05</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mason has £2.95</span>
$I

#### Develop mnemonics and memorable stories

A mnemonic is a system such as a pattern of letters or associations which assist in remembering something.

In history, a helpful mnemonic is C-O-P-E. It helps pupils COPE with analysing sources:

C - Content

O - Origin

P - Purpose

E - Evaluate

In maths or science, a helpful mnemonic is RUCSAC (As in keep your problem solving tools in your rucksack):

R - Read

U - Underline

C - Choose

S - Solve

A - Answer

C - Check

It would be useful to talk to colleagues in your subject/phase to see if there are any helpful ones they already use with pupils.

Another strategy is to use a memorable story to help pupils remember something complicated. For example, you could link a sequence of events to familiar sequences from your life (e.g. walking around your house) are linked to the stages of Hitler’s consolidation of power 1933 - 1934 as an aid to memory. By linking events to concrete things, it enables pupils to visualise and put items correctly into a sequence.

1. You walk through your front door and you go into the living room where there is a roaring fire = Reichstag Fire
2. You leave the living room and go to the kitchen and get a knife from the drawer = Night of the Long Knives
3. You see your parents = the Enabling Act
4. You see Hindenburg walk out your front door = death of Hindenburg

## Area 2: Practice makes perfect

### By trying this activity, you will…

Learn that:

4.8 Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.

### If this is successful, you will see...

- Pupils can remember information
- They develop confidence, accuracy and speed when retrieving key knowledge

### Practise…

#### Low-stakes quizzing

Low-stakes quizzing is a helpful tool for you to check your pupils' understanding and to develop their recall of key ideas. The fact that it is low-stakes means that pupils will not feel threatened to ‘have a go’ in case they get it wrong.

Be explicit that the quiz is low-stakes, i.e. “I will not be recording your score”; “This is not an assessment”.

For younger pupils, or those with EAL or SEN needs – or where you know that the knowledge is new or insecure – you may need to provide support in order for them to be able to succeed. You might do the following:

- Use closed questions more than open questions
- Use multiple-choice questions
- ‘Push’ questions which guide towards a certain idea
- Partially completed sentences
- Cloze-type activities (e.g. gap fills)
- Partially completed concept maps.

You can find more useful information here: [https://www.retrievalpractice.org](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/)

#### ‘Brain dumps’

A ‘brain dump’ is when you ask pupils to write down everything they know about a topic. You could do this in a number of ways:

- Individually
- In pairs
- In groups
- A combination of the above - e.g. on your own first, now share with your partner, now pool your information as a group.

You could also do this in a number of mediums:

- Mind map
- On paper
- On the board
- On whiteboards
- On their table using a wipeable pen
- On poster paper.

You could also do this at various points:

- Beginning of the lesson in one colour - “What can you remember about”
- End of the lesson in another colour - “What else can you now remember”
- At the end of a topic unit
- As revision.

Doing this encourages pupils to try to remember information which supports transfer to long-term memory.

#### Exit tickets

Give pupils a slip of paper, ‘a ticket’, at the end of the lesson. On the ticket should be a series of questions (around 2 or 3) about what they have learned that lesson. In order to be able to ‘exit’ the lesson, they need to complete the ticket. This encourages pupils to reflect on what they’ve learned and actively process it.

## Area 3: Adapt your teaching

### By trying this activity, you will…

Learn that:

- 5.1 Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.
- 5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
- 5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.
- 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.
- 5a. Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
- 5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations.

### If this is successful, you will see…

- Pupils who are sufficiently challenged in their learning
- Pupils are able to ‘get on’ with the task they are set
- Pupils are successful in the tasks

### Practise…

#### Assertive monitoring

The core idea of assertive monitoring is:

- By systematically checking pupils' work during a lesson a teacher can see what they have or have not understood.
- They can respond ‘in the moment’ when pupils have got things wrong or are not meeting success criteria and get them to ‘fix it’.

How to do it:

- Decide what ‘good work looks like’

  - In advance of the lesson, make sure you know what you are expecting in terms of ‘good work’

- Plan your laps:

  - What will you be looking for in each round of monitoring?
  - Name your laps as you circulate - ‘now I will be looking for’

- Plan a monitoring pathway:

  - Create a seating chart
  - Monitor the fastest workers first, then those needing more support

- Pen in hand – mark pupils’ work

  - Give feedback (tick, star, circle, code)

- Cue pupils to revise answers with minimal intervention (name the error, ask them to ‘fix it’, tell them how you’ll follow up

- Record monitoring feedback

  - Check pupils’ work
  - Track right / wrong answers or trends in the class as you circulate.

#### Reshape instruction

Being prepared to make adjustments within a lesson to provide support or challenge to individuals, groups of pupils or the whole class as appropriate. Use this when you notice that either a pupil has not understood something, is confused or they have mastered the new content and are ready to consider more complex material.

Ideas for support might include:

- Revising explanations - providing examples, breaking down information into smaller steps
- Re-teach a piece of content or key concepts
- Use questioning to guide pupils’ practice

Ideas for challenging might include:

- Ask pupils can they think of a non-example or a time when it is not true?
- Amend tasks such as removing scaffolding or using more difficult numbers
- Add extension tasks to provide further challenge
- Move onto the new material. If for just a small group, teach on a table so they can move on whilst you support others.

#### Make effective use of resources, including additional adults

1. For a lesson or sequence of lessons you are going to teach, review the resources you plan to use. Use the following questions to guide your thinking:

- Who might need additional resources?
- What kind of additional resources might be needed?
- Have I got enough written structures in place for this lesson, , e.g. sentence stems?
- Have I used word banks or glossaries to support vocabulary?
- Are there any concrete resources, such as props or models that might help aid understanding?

2. Plan how you will deploy any additional adults you have in the classroom:

- Who will they work with?
- What information might they need prior to the lesson?
- What misconceptions might they hold which you do not want to pass onto pupils?
- When should they withdraw their support and how?

$I
You do not need to create distinct tasks for different pupils. Think about how you can provide support to pupils so that they can all achieve and reach a high standard.

How do you know?                                                                                                                    |
| Use of modelling                    | - Did the teacher use modelling? - What kind of modelling was used? - Did it aid pupils’ understanding? - How do you know?                                                                                                                                            |
| Understanding pupil differences     | - Discuss with a colleague how they go about understanding pupil differences and potential barriers to learning in their class(es) - What do they do? - Who do they speak to? - How do they overcome barriers?                                                        |
| Adapting ‘in the moment’            | - Did the teacher show that they were ‘adapting in the moment’ to pupils’ needs? - How did the teacher know that he/she needed to adapt? - What did they do? - Did it have an impact on the pupils? - How does the teacher maintain high expectations for all pupils? |
| Teaching metacognitive strategies   | - Did the teacher support pupils to plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning? - How did they do this? - What questions did they ask the pupils? - How good were the pupils at being able to do this?                                                             |

## 4.1a: What you will learn

### Time allocation

5 minutes (10 minutes with video)

### Instructions

- Look over the statements covered in this Block.
- Watch the video, which introduces what you will learn in this Block and why it is important.
- Take your reflections, and any questions you have, to discuss in your first mentor session.

### In this Block, you will learn the following:

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3.1 A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning                                 |
| 3.2 Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.3 Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed                                                                                                             |
| 3.4 Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable                                 |
| 3.5 Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial                                                                                                                              |
| 3.6 In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about                                                                                  |
| 3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important |
| 3.8 Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context                                                                                                                                     |
| 3.9 To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode         |
| 3.10 Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines                                                                                          |

| Learn how to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

$Content
A school’s curriculum sets out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn. In most schools the curriculum is made up of discrete subjects, such as maths, or groupings of subjects, such as humanities. You might already feel confident in one or more subject or curriculum areas having studied it at university. Many people become teachers because of a passion for a subject and – if you ask them – will try to make the case for why their preferred subject is the most important in the curriculum! Of course, depending on the phase or department in which you teach you may well be teaching multiple subjects.

In recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation that a teacher’s <em>subject knowledge </em>is critical. There is acceptance in the literature that secure subject knowledge is a defining characteristic of effective teaching.

The in-depth, advanced subject knowledge you may have developed through university study will need to evolve further in order to make this knowledge accessible to the pupils you teach. Learning to do this will help you motivate your pupils and teach more effectively, leading to improved pupil outcomes. If you are teaching a subject or subjects which you feel less confident with, it is even more important to spend the time developing your subject and curriculum knowledge.

<ul>
  <li>
    Secure subject knowledge will allow you to better sequence lessons and
    episodes of learning as you have a more sophisticated understanding of the
    small steps it takes to master the particular content you are trying to
    teach.
  </li>
  <li>
    Secure subject knowledge will allow you to anticipate common misconceptions
    and to plan intentionally for these.
  </li>
  <li>
    We know that pupils’ motivation is derived from their feelings of success ‒
    the better they are taught, the more likely they are to be successful and
    therefore motivated.
  </li>
</ul>
To be effective in teaching any subject you will need to be explicit in teaching
pupils the knowledge and skills they need to be successful. You will need to have
a particularly strong understanding of the essential concepts within the subject
or subjects you teach in order to ensure that pupils have a secure foundation from
which to begin to think critically about the subject.

Experienced and effective teachers have a strong repertoire of examples to explain these key ideas – we know that pupils learn better when abstract concepts are illustrated with multiple, concrete examples. You will also start to see how generic pedagogical strategies can best be applied within each subject: tools like questioning can only be truly effective if the question is devised from a place of secure knowledge.

Dedicating time to developing your subject and curriculum knowledge can also be hard to do among the myriad of competing priorities that you face in school, especially at the beginning of your career. It can feel more important to deal with immediate concerns, such as planning your next lesson or dealing with a behaviour incident, instead of setting aside time to enhance your understanding of the subject and curriculum. This Block will show you the importance of making time to prioritise this aspect of your practice.

This Block will also support you to develop your understanding of the importance of literacy and build a collection of teaching skills related to it. Improvements in literacy skills support pupils to access the curriculum across all subject areas, not just English or Humanities; and good literacy develops throughout pupils’ school careers, not just in early primary. Every teacher must take responsibility for improving pupils’ literacy skills in their subject area.

Block 4 has been designed with all of this in mind and seeks to support you with practical strategies to develop your subject and curriculum knowledge, encouraging you to seek out the support and expertise of more experienced colleagues to do so. It builds on everything you have learned so far about classroom practice, how pupils learn and adaptive teaching.

## What do we mean by “curriculum”?

You probably have a good idea of what we mean by curriculum already, but it is worth noting that there are different definitions. The Early Career Framework states:

$I
A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning.
$I

A similar definition that a lot of schools will look to is that of Ofsted:

$I
A curriculum is a framework for setting out the aims of a programme of education, including the knowledge and understanding to be gained at each stage; for translating that framework over time into a structure and narrative within an institutional context; and for evaluating what knowledge and understanding pupils have gained against expectations.

<p style="text-align: right;">Ofsted working definition of curriculum, 2018</p>
$I

One of the real strengths of education in England is that schools have a great deal of freedom to set their own curricula. As a result, there are very different visions for education within schools, although all are based around the same national framework for a broad and balanced curriculum.

Before we consider the evidence in this area, take a minute to write down some ideas about what this looks like in your school. You will have a chance to discuss this with your mentor in your first meeting for this Block.

$CTA

<h2>In your notepad</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is your school’s broad vision for education?</li>
  <li>
    What are the outcomes of this vision and how are the outcomes described? In
    terms of pupils’ lives? Their results?
  </li>
  <li>
    How does this vision translate into your school’s curriculum choices? For
    example, what subjects does your school offer, or is the learning organised
    into general themes? What does this look like in your department? And in
    your classroom?
  </li>
</ul>
$CTA

While schools interpret the national curriculum, further interpretation happens at department, phase and classroom levels. It is usually teachers who are responsible for the selection, sequencing and pacing of subject knowledge, skills and concepts into forms suitable for teaching, such as schemes of work, topic plans and individual lesson plans. As an Early Career Teacher, you may not yet have much control over the “big picture” curriculum in your school but translating that into your lesson planning over time is well within your scope. The more secure your subject knowledge, the more effective you will be at doing this.

## Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively

At its simplest, the skill of teaching is about making sure pupils understand new things: when teaching new content in a subject area, your goal is to make it “comprehensible to others” (Ball et al., 2008). Having a deep knowledge of the subject you are teaching is essential to be able to do this well. Indeed, when teachers’ knowledge falls below a certain level it can limit students’ learning (Coe et al., 2014).

Hattie (2012) explains that expert teachers are able to use their subject knowledge to organise and use content more effectively for pupils to understand. Teachers with secure subject knowledge are more confident to respond to individual student needs, recognise those who need support and change the way information is presented to support learning. This leads to pupils experiencing success, which in turn is motivating and will encourage them to continue trying hard even when content becomes more complex.

So, what does secure subject knowledge look like? Secure subject knowledge is more than just knowing facts and concepts. Shulman (1986) argued that teachers must also understand the structure and rules of a subject. In other words, teachers need to know both the _what_ and the _why_.

- Understanding why something is true and how central it is to the subject you are teaching allows you to emphasise the key concepts, prioritise foundational knowledge and sequence learning so that pupils can develop a deep understanding of the subject and how new content builds on and connects to previous learning.
- Understanding why will also help you to anticipate and plan for common misconceptions which pupils may already have or are likely to develop. You explored misconceptions in Block 2 in relation to how pupils learn. Secure subject knowledge will both help you to anticipate misconceptions and to explain them in greater depth to pupils.

We will look at both these points in more detail in the next section. For now, let’s just take a look at how this type of knowledge helps us in our teaching. For example, having a deep understanding of the subject you are teaching supports you to give thorough and detailed explanations to your pupils which avoids them developing false assumptions. False assumptions over time might embed in their memory as misconceptions.

In the example below, the teacher responds to a correct answer by expanding beyond superficial understanding of a concept. Why do you think the teacher did this?

$I

<strong>Teacher:</strong> “What is 45 x 10?”

<strong>Student:</strong> “It’s 450! When you times by ten <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  you always get a zero on the end.
</span>
”

<strong>Teacher:</strong> “You’re correct that 45 x 10 is 450. And you’re right that
multiplying by 10 often means that the answer has a zero on the end. But that’s not
always true. When you multiply by 10, all of the numbers move up a place value and
so the 5 units becomes 50. The zero indicates no units. If you multiply 0.3 by 10,
the answer would be 3 units. There won’t be a zero on the end.” $I

The teacher uses their secure subject knowledge to pick up a potential pitfall that might lead to mistakes. This aspect of subject knowledge develops over time and comes with experience. Spending time talking to more experienced colleagues specifically about the misconceptions which pupils will experience in a given area is almost always time well spent. The teacher leaves nothing to chance – they are completely explicit in the way they teach the concept.

Where there is a fundamental idea or concept which you have identified for pupils to master, the most beneficial approach for pupils is to teach them it explicitly. As you can see from this example, when a teacher is explicit and clearly directs pupils to the knowledge and skills needed in a particular subject area, they help to structure the acquisition of new learning including how to use the language of the subject (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). This is where secure subject knowledge will support you in motivating and teaching effectively; you will be able to break concepts down and model these in a way that will support all pupils.

$I

<h3>What do we mean by explicit teaching?</h3>
Explicit teaching involves the teacher introducing new material in a careful sequence,
taking care to explain new concepts in a structured way. It involves explanation,
modelling and practice.

Explicit teaching might include:

<ul>
  <li>
    Explicitly teaching key vocabulary pupils will need to access the topic
  </li>
  <li>
    Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and
    principles in the subject
  </li>
  <li>Modelling answers or processes on the board</li>
  <li>
    Carefully pacing explanations with appropriate use of questioning and
    practice time
  </li>
  <li>Using a variety of examples and non-examples</li>
  <li>
    Guiding pupil practice and providing sufficient time for practice and review
  </li>
  <li>Helping pupils when they make errors.</li>
</ul>
Presenting new material in small steps, with opportunities to practise after each
step is effective, especially if the teacher assists the pupils as they practise
to scaffold their learning, such as through questioning or further explanations (Rosenshine,
2012). $I

## Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed

In the example above, the teacher draws the pupil’s attention to a fundamental concept in mathematics – place value – reinforcing how this core idea is applied within the subject. An important part of your role is to ensure pupils encounter and master the foundational concepts and knowledge in the subjects you teach. Pupils having a firm grasp of these fundamentals will allow them to succeed as they encounter new topics in the subject and consequently build their confidence (Deans for Impact, 2015). By providing deliberate, instructional support to make sure that these foundational concepts are well understood, you are giving your pupils the best chance of success. Again, the types of explicit teaching strategies outlined above will help.

While schools might approach curriculum design in different ways, or have different visions for the education of pupils, carefully sequencing and staging what pupils need to know – and making clear links between new knowledge and prior learning – should be universal. You learned in Block 2 that pupils construct new knowledge and understanding based on what they already know (Roediger & Butler, 2011), and this is the case in all subjects. You will also remember that the way we mentally organise knowledge, joining new concepts to existing knowledge in increasingly complex mental models, is called schemata. If we are unable to connect new knowledge to existing information within our long-term memory, it is likely to be forgotten.

Foundational concepts are particularly important in this regard as they make connections with lots of other concepts within the subject. For example, if a pupil already knows and understands that light can be turned into energy, grasping the process of photosynthesis can happen more quickly. When we introduce a new concept, we can help pupils to strengthen their existing schema in a subject by making explicit links to what they already know. Often this will be a core concept.

Of course, you will already have seen that however carefully you think about how to present new concepts, pupils will end up with differing levels of understanding. This can be because they have different levels of prior knowledge of the subject and because pupils can and will connect new knowledge to previously learned misconceptions which can impede their learning (Guzzetti, 2011).

Whatever the reason, every subject has its common misconceptions which some or all pupils will encounter. The good news is that as you gain experience as a teacher, you will become more and more adept at anticipating these misconceptions and addressing them in your teaching. This is an important element of curricular knowledge: the evidence shows that teachers with comparable levels of subject knowledge but with a better understanding of misconceptions in their subject have more impact on student outcomes (Coe et al., 2014).

Until you have developed this expertise – and even when you have – the key to dealing with misconceptions is to be proactive and address them in your planning. As a new teacher, this can be challenging. To a certain extent, the best way to understand what the misconceptions are in each topic or subject is to witness how pupils succeed or struggle. Therefore, this is an area where you should draw on the know-how of your more experienced colleagues. Before teaching a new area, you could ask:

- What misconceptions might pupils already hold?
- What do pupils typically misunderstand about this concept?
- What common mistakes or errors do they make when applying the concept in practice?
- Is there an alternative way of communicating this concept that will reduce the likelihood of misconceptions taking hold?
- Who from my team or wider networks might have experience of teaching this content before and know common misconceptions?

There is a suggested activity in section 4.4 of these self-study materials to help you draw this type of information out from your colleagues. You will also do an activity with your mentor on how to identify the essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles in your subject.

## Secure subject knowledge allows pupils to think critically within the subject area

We want pupils to think hard about topics and to engage deeply with new knowledge. The research evidence shows that secure background knowledge is an important prerequisite for critical thinking to take place (Bailin et al., 1999).

For pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. Learning to think critically involves thinking about something. For example, you cannot think critically about the causes of the second world war without first having a good knowledge of the events leading up to the war.

Because background knowledge is so important, it is also likely that pupils will struggle to transfer what they learn in one subject or discipline to another. For example, if a pupil practises evaluation of similar texts in English – with lots of initial guidance before the support is tapered and the underlying structure of what good evaluation looks like is pointed out – the pupil will get better at evaluating other similar texts. The specific nature of the critical thinking task here is unlikely to transfer easily to many other subjects or even other types of text.

There are many types of critical thinking tasks (such as comparing, classifying, judging) which are cognitively demanding but don’t aid schema building. Unless the background knowledge is secure, more complex critical thinking tasks may actually _detract_ from learning. In the examples below, Teacher A assumes that their pupils will be able to engage critically with a text in the same way as an expert (such as the teacher). Teacher B takes a different approach. Why is this more likely to be effective?

$I

<h3>
  <b>Example A</b>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      A teacher wants pupils to read a historical source and to examine its
      validity. 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher hands out the source at the start of the lesson and asks
      pupils to complete the task.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Pupils read the source in small groups and prepare their ideas to share
      with the group.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Each group shares with the class but their responses are not well
      developed, focusing on things like how difficult it was to read the
      handwriting and understand the language of Elizabethan writers.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  <b>Example B</b>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Before the lesson, the teacher identifies that for pupils to be successful
      analysing the usefulness of a text they need to know certain information
      about the period.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher starts the lesson with a quick recall quiz on prior knowledge
      linked to the period, including the names of people and important dates.
      The teacher follows up with some targeted questions to check
      understanding.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher explicitly models the skills needed when examining a source
      for reliability, and together the class creates a checklist of questions
      to ask such as: Who wrote the source? Can they be trusted? Why? 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher hands out the historical source and pupils work in small
      groups to answer the pre-agreed questions.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Pupils share back to the rest of the class, comparing and building on each
      other’s answers to each of the pre-agreed questions.{" "}

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Learning to read and write is an essential skill for modern life, yet a
  surprising fraction of adults in OECD countries have not yet mastered the
  basics... literacy problems are particularly serious in England, where younger
  adults perform no better than older ones... Poor literacy also drives low
  social mobility, since children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely
  to start school with lower literacy skills.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  How can this situation be improved? There is a solid evidence base that
  teachers and teaching methods can matter both for literacy… and for learning
  outcomes more generally.

Language provides the foundation of thinking and learning. Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen in a way that lets us communicate effectively and make sense of the world (National Literacy Trust, 2020). Without good literacy skills, a pupil will struggle to access the curriculum and hence be unable to learn effectively. This might show itself as:

- Difficulty following instructions
- Poor comprehension when reading subject texts
- Lack of fluency when reading aloud
- Incoherent written or spoken explanations.

The long-term effects of weak literacy will impact a pupil far beyond school. At the everyday level, they will struggle with form filling, reading and understanding signs. The impact on their life chances can be profound, from limiting their career options and reducing their lifetime earning potential, through to poor health and lower life expectancy (Gilbert et al., 2018).

The task of improving pupils’ literacy skills starts from the very beginning of education and continues all through secondary school. Even though “learning to read” is perceived as a task for teachers in early primary, the reality is that every teacher, across all subjects and all phases, can and should think carefully how they can improve pupils’ literacy. For example, all primary teachers will need to reinforce the fundamental knowledge of word reading (decoding) and language comprehension. For most secondary teachers, improving pupils’ literacy will mainly involve thinking about how you can improve reading, writing and speaking skills in relation to your subject discipline.

Consequently, it is important that all teachers have a clear understanding of the most effective ways to improve literacy. In terms of reading, the most effective approach is _systematic synthetic phonics._

<h3>An introduction to phonics</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Phonics is a way of teaching children how to read and write. It helps children
  hear, identify and use different sounds that distinguish one word from another
  in the English language. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Written language can be compared to a code, so knowing the sounds of
  individual letters and how these letters sound when they’re combined will help
  children decode words as they read. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Understanding phonics will also help children know which letters to use when
  they are writing words. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The most widely used approach associated with the teaching of reading in which
  phonemes (sounds) associated with particular graphemes (letters) are
  pronounced in isolation and blended together (synthesised). For example,
  children are taught to take a single-syllable word such as cat apart to its
  three letters, pronounce a phoneme for each letter in turn /k/, /æ/, /t/ and
  blend the phonemes together to form a word.

  it basically means helping them learn how to blend sounds. With synthetic
  phonics, we are teaching spelling too. We teach spelling as the reverse of
  reading. For reading, children see the word first and then say the sounds. For
  spelling, children hear the word first and then say the sounds. So, to spell,
  “dog”, children are not asked to look at the letters and remember them. They
  listen to the word, repeat it and say the sounds, d...o...g…dog. Then they
  write the letters for the sounds. Repeat the sounds slowly, as you write the
  letters on the board, d…o…g. Then point to the letters, say the sounds and
  blend them, to read the word and check all the sounds, d…o...g...dog.

Literacy really is the responsibility of every teacher. The evidence suggests that pupils benefit from a balanced approach to literacy that includes a range of approaches (EEF, 2018) and within this every teacher should make efforts to explicitly teach reading, writing and oral language skills, whatever their phase or subject. The table below provides some examples of approaches you could try in your classroom. You should familiarise yourself with these approaches in advance of your first training session for this Block. After the training session, you should choose one or more of these approaches to trial in your classroom.

## Reading and comprehension

- 3n Supporting younger pupils to become fluent readers and to write fluently and legibly
- 3p Modelling reading comprehension by asking questions, making predictions, and summarising when reading
- 3q Promoting reading for pleasure (e.g. by using a range of whole class reading approaches and regularly reading high-quality texts to children)

| Approach           | What is the approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | How do I make it work effectively?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reciprocal Reading | - This is the explicit practice of four core skills used for comprehension (predict, clarify, question, summarise). - As they read, students are invited to stop and practise these reading roles. - This can be built into any text and can be practised in whole class settings or ideally in small groups.Examples- Predictor: what do you predict will happen next? - Summariser: what has happened so far? - Clarifier: what does this word mean? - Questioner: what questions do you have?                                                                                                       | - Explain clearly to pupils, modelling it first yourself. - Give students feedback on their predictions, summaries, clarifications and questions. - Highlight the process. - Prepare some sentence stems for each. - Choose a text which is suitable for the level. - Use this approach regularly so pupils build up their skills. |
| Story Mapping      | - This can be used for any “story”, fiction or nonfiction, e.g. the “story” of the water cycle, or _Jekyll and Hyde\_\_._ - Teacher considers the text and key elements they want to draw attention to (e.g. characters, plot, setting, themes). - Teacher introduces the text and provides each pupil with a blank story map. - As they read, pupils complete the sections on their story map ‒teacher can prompt with questions (e.g. what happened first?). - The class might review their story maps together to share ideas and make sure everyone has completed theirs with the key information. | - Complete a whole-class story map to model the approach. - Pupils create their own story maps for homework. - Use part-complete story maps as a scaffold for some pupils. - Prompt pupils with lots of questions, “What did you notice?”, “Where could this go on our story map?”                                                 |

## Writing

- 3n Supporting younger pupils to become fluent readers and to write fluently and legibly. Teaching different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting and editing

| Approach       | What is the approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | How do I make it work effectively ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paired Writing | - App                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | - Pair students up in different ways, e.g. by ability. - Model the planning stage. - The writing task builds on previous knowledge, e.g. from last lesson.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Shared Writing | - Teacher acts as the scribe, writing or typing on the board or flipchart as the pupils give ideas. - Class works together to make suggestions for what to write and co-create a model. - Teacher uses questioning throughout to encourage involvement, challenge ideas and ask students to explain why they are suggesting something (process). | - Every pupil has four talk cards. Ask everyone to “spend” their cards by making four contributions to the task. - Pupils may want to write along, or share the co-written model after, or leave it visible as they write their own version. - Ask a pupil to tally contributions from the class under “ideas” and “edits”. |

## Oral language skills

- 3r Modelling and requiring high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary)

| Approach                             | What is the approach?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | How do I make it work effectively?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sentence stems to support discussion | - Decide in advance of the lesson what you want pupils to talk about and what key language you would like them to use. - Prepare some sentence stems for this. - During the lesson, invite pupils to discuss an idea or concept using the sentence stems.For example:- General: I agree with…; However…; Based on… we can conclude… - Content specific: I think the character is feeling… because…; The data shows a relationship between… and… | - Provide sentence stems for everybody or use as a scaffold to support some pupils. - Model the use of sentence stems. - Prepare a bank of common sentence stems for display. - Sentence stems help pupils speak in full sentences.Use this approach regularly so pupils' talk improves over time. |
| Think, pair, share                   | - Teacher poses a question to the class. - Pupils have a few minutes to think about their response (maybe jotting down some notes). - Teacher asks pupils to share their initial ideas with a pair and practise their answer. - Teacher asks a few pupils to share with the whole class.                                                                                                                                                        | - Use sentence stems to help pupils structure their answers. - Giving practice time helps pupils to feel more confident.                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Language and vocabulary

- 3o Teaching unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and planning for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary in what is taught

| Approach                                          | What is the approach?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | How do I make it work effectively?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit teaching (Robust vocabulary instruction) | - Teacher identifies tier 2 and tier 3 vocabulary in their subject (see below). - Teacher introduces the new word and provides a student friendly definition (e.g. simple language such as “Abolish means to get rid or something or end it.”). - Teacher uses the word in context (e.g. “The United States _abolished_ slavery in 1865.”). - Teacher provides opportunities for multiple exposures (e.g. by sharing a variety of examples: My goal is to abolish world poverty. Should we have a debate on whether to abolish taxes?). - Teacher provides opportunity for repeated practice of newly learned vocabulary in talk, writing and reading (e.g. pupils use the new vocabulary in their next task). | - Identify important vocabulary to teach explicitly, i.e that which pupils will encounter often or which are foundational to the subject. - Always provide lots of opportunities for pupils to use the new vocabulary, e.g. in sentence stems. Pupils have only “learned” a new word when they can recognise it orally, when written, and can write it and use it verbally themselves. - Revisit the new vocabulary in spaced intervals and interleave where possible. |
| Knowledge organisers                              | - Teacher creates an empty knowledge organiser for pupils to use over a topic. - Each time the pupils encounter a new or important word, they add it to their knowledge organiser. - Sections might include: the word, a definition, examples of it being used, synonyms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - Create one of these for yourself to map all of the vocabulary pupils need to learn in the topic. - Co-create a vocabulary knowledge organiser with the class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

<h3>Why is teaching vocabulary important and what is tiered vocabulary?</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  A wide and varied vocabulary is a key aspect of literacy. Knowing what words
  mean ensures that pupils can comprehend meaning – the more words they know,
  the more they will understand about a topic or be able to infer from a text. A
  robust vocabulary supports all aspects of communication: listening, speaking,
  reading and writing. There are some words which pupils will learn through
  hearing them repeated often (such as “no” and “cat”) and others which will
  need to be explicitly taught through systematic vocabulary instruction. We
  call these tier 2 and tier 3 words.
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Tier 1: Words of everyday speech, familiar to most children. 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Tier 2: High-utility words likely to appear frequently in a wide variety
      of contexts — instruction in these words can add significantly to a
      pupil's language ability.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Tier 3: Low-frequency words, domain specific, most likely learned in a
      subject context. 
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<b>Examples</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Examples of tier 1 words are: book, hill, talk, cat, yellow. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Examples of tier 2 words are: evaluate, report, beneficial, hilarious,
  pollution, impression. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Examples of tier 3 words are: ion, metamorphic, tectonic, omniscient,
  continent. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The EEF report for secondary school teachers recommends that they should
  prioritise teaching tier 2 and 3 vocabulary, which students are unlikely to
  encounter in everyday speech.{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Choose which words you will explicitly teach in your subject or phase 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Remember that these are most likely to be tier 2 and tier 3 words because
      they are more complex or subject specific and therefore less likely to be
      acquired through oral language. 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      You should select these words when planning a lesson or sequence of
      lessons so that you have time to plan how you will teach them.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  To do this you can use the robust vocabulary instruction in the table above.{" "}

## Video

In this video, the teacher is using the reciprocal reading technique from the table of approaches above. Some pupils may be expert decoders and therefore able to read fluently, but unable to comprehend the meaning of the text. This approach is helpful because it allows pupils to articulate their ideas aloud to a group, exposing where there is confusion or lack of comprehension. It makes explicit the metacognitive strategies that readers use for reading comprehension: predicting, summarising, questioning and clarifying.

Watch this video of a teacher running a reciprocal reading group and consider the following questions:

- How do the different roles of predict, clarify, summarise and question help the pupils with their reading comprehension?
- How does the teacher manage the conversation and support reading comprehension?
- How might this technique work in your subject?

<h3>
  A Year 3 reading group, four students and one adult reading{" "}
  <i>The Tiger Who Came to Tea.</i>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Before we start reading this book, Joe would you like to predict
  what the text is about? Remember to explain why you are making your
  prediction.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Joe: “I predict this is going to be a story about a girl who has a pet tiger
  and they are best friends and have a birthday party for the tiger because the
  picture on the front shows the girl sitting with the tiger and there is a cake
  on the table.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Oh interesting… OK, well let’s find out… Anna, can you begin reading
  please? As Anna reads, don’t forget to underline words or phrases that you
  might want to clarify.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anna: reads aloud as other pupils follow in their own text.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Thank you, Anna. Let’s stop there and check some things. Firstly,
  are there any words we need to clarify?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe: “What does ‘grocer’ mean?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anna: “That’s the question I was going to ask{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  what is a grocer? And who is a grocer boy?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Good question – Mohammed, can you clarify the word grocer for us
  please?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Mohammed: “I will try sounding the word out loud – ‘grocer’. Hmmm. That hasn’t
  really helped. Next, I’ll read the sentences and think about what would make
  sense: ‘And it can’t be the boy from the grocer because this isn’t the day he
  comes.’ Oh, maybe the grocer is a place? Because it says, ‘from the grocer’. I
  think I’ll ask a friend{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> does anyone else know what a grocer is?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No-one is sure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Well done Mohammed, a grocer is a place – a grocer is short for
  greengrocer. Nowadays you might get your vegetables from the supermarket but
  there are also shops dedicated to just vegetables called greengrocers. In
  fact, there is one on the main street outside – do you know it?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pupils: “Yes!”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “A grocer-boy is like the shop-boy, the boy who works at the
  greengrocers. Grocer-boys used to deliver the vegetables to people’s houses so
  they didn’t have to go to the shops. OK, Harry, can you summarise what has
  happened so far?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Harry: “First there was a little girl called Sophie and then the doorbell rang
  and it was the grocer and the milkman and the Daddy.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Are you sure? Mohammed, can you clarify what happened when the
  doorbell rang?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Mohammed: “The mummy didn’t know who it was because she asked if it was the
  milkman or the grocer or daddy, so we don’t know who was at the door.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “That’s right – do you see, Harry? The Mummy says ‘I wonder who that
  can be? Which means she doesn’t know who is at the door yet.”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Anna do you have any other questions for us before we read on?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna: “Who do you think is at the door?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher: “Let’s ask Joe, our predictor. Joe, who do you think is at the door?”
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Joe: “I think that maybe it is the grocer! Or maybe the Daddy lost his key. Or
  it could be the tiger!”
</span>

## Securing your subject knowledge

### By trying this activity, you will...

#### Learn that:

3.2 Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively

3.4 Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable

3e Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with experienced colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts

3f Discussing curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balancing exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge

### Having a secure subject knowledge will mean…

- Pupils are motivated by the subject and the work.
- Pupils’ misunderstandings are revealed and dealt with.
- Pupils are successful and derive satisfaction from this.

### Practice...

#### **Mining your colleagues for information**

Your colleagues will be a very valuable source of information for you in terms of subject knowledge, especially to give you intelligence on what pupils typically get wrong and/or find most challenging. You should spend some time talking to colleagues and asking for advice. The following question stems might help you to do this:

- “If you were teaching X, what would you want to make sure pupils knew before starting… ?”
- “Where does X fit in the wider curriculum map? What comes before, what comes after?”
- “What common misconceptions do pupils have within this topic?”
- “I am going to be teaching X and am unsure what the most important things for pupils to think about are. Can you help?”
- “When you taught X previously, how did you make sure that pupils were thinking about the most important thing?”
- “What do pupils typically get wrong in this topic? How do you deal with this?”
- How do you go about making sure that you provide enough time for repetition within your planning?
- What kinds of activities have you found helpful for supporting pupils to practise critical skills and knowledge?

#### Utilising subject associations

Subject associations can be a useful source of information to develop your subject knowledge. Most of them have regular publications. Spend some time exploring the relevant one for you. [https://www.subjectassociations.org.uk/](about:blank)

#### Utilising resources effectively

Your department or phase team will be able to help you identify high-quality resources for your subject or phase. These might include:

- Textbooks
- Websites
- Department/phase resource banks.

You can use resources to improve your subject knowledge. Here are some things to consider:

- How does this resource explain a particular concept?
- What types of practice activities does it provide?
- How do the examples in the resource address possible misconceptions?
- What language does the resource use to explain key concepts and knowledge which pupils need to understand?
- Are there any potential misconceptions which the resource has explicitly highlighted?

## Sequencing effectively

### By trying this activity, you will…

#### Learn that:

3.3 Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed

3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important

#### Sequencing effectively will mean that you have…

1. Pupils that are confident.
2. Pupils who are clear on what they are doing and why they are doing it.
3. Pupils who are able to make links to existing knowledge.

### Practice...

#### Working backwards

Deciding what to put in your units of work (and even in individual lessons) is a challenging task. Approaching your planning by _starting at the end_ is an effective way to approach this task.

For example, imagine you are planning a unit of work on energy. Instead of starting with the topic and being overwhelmed by all the things you _could_ teach, begin by thinking about the end. Follow these steps, working backwards:

1. What are the fundamental things (knowledge, concepts and skills) you want your pupils to take away from this unit? Therefore…
2. What needs to be in the end of unit assessment to check the knowledge and skills have been taught?
3. What do the individual aims and objectives need to be in the preceding lessons to support pupils to be successful in the end of unit assessment?
4. In what ways will you check that pupils are on track within each lesson?
5. Have you ordered your content from foundational to more complex to ensure pupils are more likely to build confidence and succeed?

You can use this approach for the design of individual lessons within the unit.

1. What do I need my pupils to know by the end of this lesson in order to meet the overall aims and objectives?
2. What do I need to provide input on for them to achieve this?
3. What tasks/activities can I design around this input to check pupils have understood?
4. How can I make sure pupils have connected this learning to what they have done before?

#### C**onnecting the learning**

Review your lesson plans for the next week. For each lesson, make sure your starter or “do now” activity is one which connects the learning of that lesson to the previous lessons. Some ideas for doing this are below:

- Five quick questions: pupils answer five quick questions in their books or on mini-whiteboards based on the learning from the previous lesson.
- Ask five questions: pupils have to write five questions about the previous lesson.
- Unscramble key vocabulary: use key words from the previous lesson and scramble them up. Pupils need to unscramble the words, define them and then write a paragraph using as many of the words as possible.
- Beat the teacher! Write a paragraph based on the previous lesson but containing mistakes. Pupils need to find the mistakes and correct them.

#### D**evelop a knowledge organiser**

A knowledge organiser which outlines the essential knowledge required for a specific unit of work. It can support the learning of foundational concepts because:

- It provides a reference point for pupils to continuously refer back to
- It provides the essential contextual knowledge (i.e. definitions and key words) required to access the learning.

Knowledge organisers can be helpful for teachers as well as pupils – the process of developing a knowledge organiser can be an effective way for you to decide what the foundational knowledge/concepts in your subject or current topic are.

An example of a knowledge organiser for history:

- A one-page document, including:

  - Key dates
  - Key vocabulary and definitions
  - Key individuals
  - Other pertinent information such as legislation relevant to the period being studied, e.g. The Elizabethan Poor Law.

The use of the organiser needs to be integrated into your lessons. For example:

- Train the pupils in how to learn the material. Be explicit about the fact that learning information organised in different ways will help them to remember it.
- Use it as an aid for homework, e.g. “Learn section 1 of your knowledge organiser for homework.”. Test the pupils on the knowledge in the next lesson.
- You can also use it to track whether pupils have secured the foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on, e.g. pupils highlight green when they have successfully learned an aspect.
- Use it as an aid for retrieval within lessons.
- The knowledge organiser needs to be presented in such a way that further organisation of it could take place by pupils.

Read more about knowledge organisers here: <https://my.chartered.college/2019/05/organising-knowledge-the-purpose-and-pedagogy-of-knowledge-organisers/>

#### **Reviewing and reflecting on a sequence of lessons**

Dedicating time to review and reflect upon lessons you teach will give you information which will help you become a better teacher. Take some time to carefully consider the way you sequenced your lessons. Ask yourself:

- How well prepared was I to teach this sequence of lessons? (Did I do pre-reading? etc.) What would I do differently next time?
- Did the way I sequenced the lessons work? Did the pupils acquire the fundamental knowledge, concepts and skills that I wanted them to by the end of the sequence? If not, why not? Would I change anything about the sequencing next time? Why?

## **Area 3: Explicit teaching of subject-specific knowledge and skills**

### By trying this activity, you will...

#### **Learn that:**

3.5 Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial

### If this is happening in your classroom, you will see...

- Pupils who can connect what they are learning to prior learning.
- Pupils who are clear on what they need to do.
- Pupils who are able to give subject-specific explanations and examples.

### Practice...

#### **Reflecting on quality explicit teaching:**

Ask a peer or your mentor to observe you teaching. As an alternative, you could find a colleague to observe and time them. Ensure you are clear on the purpose of the observation and what you are there to do.

Keep a note of when the teacher explicitly teaches the knowledge or skills pupils need. This might be through:

- Quality explanations
- Giving examples, modelling or using illustrations
- Discussing or teaching vocabulary

Note down:

- What did the teacher do / say?
- What resources / examples did they use?
- What was the impact on the learning after the explicit teaching moment? How did it affect pupils learning?

Reflect on the following at the end of the lesson:

- Was enough explicit input provided to pupils to help them succeed in the lesson? What evidence was there of this?
- Were the explanations high-quality? How did they support pupils to understand the key concepts?
- Were the examples of high-quality? How did they support pupils in understanding the key concepts?
- Did the teacher spend enough time on making sure pupils had the right subject-specific vocabulary to produce high-quality work? How did pupils demonstrate this during the lesson?
- Did the explicit teaching support pupils to learn the lesson outcomes? Why/why not? What would the teacher do differently next time?

#### Script an exposition for a topic you will teach

Choose a lesson where you are going to have to teach pupils a concept that is challenging. Write a script for how you will introduce pupils to that concept. Use the following questions to support you to do so:

1. What do my pupils already know about this topic?
2. How can I use what my pupils already know to help them understand this new material?
3. How can I make explicit how this new content builds on what they already know?
4. Is my explanation clear and carefully constructed?
5. Have I used pictures/diagrams/illustrations to support my explanation?
6. What examples have I used to support my explanation? Are they high-quality?
7. Are there any non-examples I could use?
8. What misconceptions might my pupils have? How can I address these explicitly?

<h3>
  Here is an example script from a teacher who is going to teach her class about
  metaphors for the first time. She has already taught them similes.
</h3>
“Today we are going to learn something new. By the end of this lesson, you are going
to be able to tell me what a metaphor is and be able to use them. This builds on
the work we did already on similes.

Can you now turn to your partner and remind them what a simile is and give an example. You have two minutes. [Pupils discuss with their partner while the teacher circulates and listens to conversations.] 3, 2, 1... thank you. Joseph, I liked what I heard you telling your partner, can you please share with the class. [Joseph shares with the class.]

Remember, when we use a simile, we compare by saying something is <strong>like</strong> or <strong>as</strong> something else. For example, ‘you are as cold as ice’. Today, we are going to build on this knowledge to understand and be able to use metaphors.

A metaphor is when you compare something by saying it <strong>is</strong> something else. Both these techniques are used by writers to pick out characteristics of the thing that we are describing to convey meaning to the reader and add depth to what we are describing; they help us to <strong>show, not tell</strong>. Here is an example of a metaphor: ‘He is a shining star.’

Can you now turn to your partner and decide which of these is a metaphor and why: a. Hope makes me feel optimistic and positive about the future; b. Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul. You have one minute. [Pupils discuss with their partner while the teacher circulates and listens to conversations.] 3, 2, 1... thank you. Nadia, you and Rajib said b ‒can you explain why?” [Nadia shares with the class.]
$I

#### Develop and use a bank of subject-specific examples for a topic

Take a unit of work that you are going to teach soon. This may be a unit that you are planning from scratch or one that already exists. For each lesson consider:

1. What are the key pieces of knowledge and skills that are being taught?
2. What are the current examples being used to illustrate?
3. Could these current examples be better (i.e. more relevant, more up to date)?
4. How will I explain this example? Is there a diagram/picture/illustration that could support its explanation?

Examples of knowledge and skills needed for different topics:

Biology ‒ Respiration

- To know that respiration is a cellular process
- To know that during respiration the energy stored inside glucose is transferred
- To know the difference between breathing and respiration
- To be able to contrast respiration and fermentation

PE – Basketball

- To be able to dribble the ball
- To be able to chest pass
- To be able to bounce pass
- To be able to pivot
- To know the key rules of a basketball game

It would be useful to share your thoughts or ask questions of colleagues and also pupils to help you.

## **Time allocation**

60 minutes

## **Instructions**

- Use this time to plan and carry out observations of your colleagues or be observed yourself.
- Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- In your mentor session 4.6, you will have a chance to reflect on what you learn from observing other colleagues or being observed yourself.
- You might choose to observe or be observed on one of the foci below or on a range of the foci.
- Use the suggested observation ideas below to plan your observations. You don’t need to do all of them but choose the one(s) which you feel will be most helpful – your mentor can help you plan this.
- You can use the [adaptable observation handout (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/adaptable-handout-2-lesson-observation-template/) to make notes on the observation.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.

### Time allocation

5 minutes (10 minutes with video)

### Instructions

- Look over the statements covered in this Block.
- Watch the video, which introduces what you will learn in this Block and why it is important.
- Take your reflections, and any questions you have, to discuss in your first mentor session.

### In this Block, you will learn the following:

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 4.6 Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems |
| 4.7 High quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary                                                    |
| 6.1 Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs                                                 |
| 6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear                                                     |
| 6.3 Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use                                               |
| 6.4 To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect            |
| 6.5 High quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve                 |

Assessment is a really important, ongoing process of finding out what your pupils know and can do, where there are gaps and crucially what they and you need to do next to progress their learning.

You won’t find a teacher in England that tells you that they’re not using assessment to find out what their pupils are learning – this is known as <em>formative assessment</em>. But are they doing it well? What does it even mean to do assessment well? Why is feedback so important as part of the assessment cycle? How often and how detailed should your assessments and feedback be?

Get it right and assessment and feedback can be a teacher's best friend. Formative assessment is one of the things research is most certain will improve learning, especially when combined with high-quality feedback. Get it wrong and it can be the bane of your life. Bad assessment practices are both pointless and time consuming. It is easy to spend huge amounts of time setting and marking assessment that doesn’t tell you much. Equally, if you fail to deliver the feedback in a useful way it might not make any difference to pupil progress.

This Block will support you to establish what effective assessment and feedback practices are.

When assessment is used well, it gives you critical information about what pupils are learning, what they understand and what additional support they need. For an assessment to be effective, it is important to be clear about the reasons you are assessing a pupil at any particular point. To do this, you need to develop an understanding of what good assessment looks like.

Assessment can easily become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on your workload. To avoid this, it is important to work with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment. Good questioning in the classroom is also an easy and efficient way to assess learning. During this Block, we will provide you with ideas on how to do this in a practical way to ease the load.

Just as you need the information from assessments to support you to adapt and improve your teaching, pupils need information from you in the form of feedback to help them improve their work. Within this Block we will explore what this looks like in practice, drawing on key evidence from research about what makes feedback effective in improving learning outcomes.

You may be feeling as though assessment and feedback is a demanding aspect of your teaching role, but through this Block you will understand that mastering assessment and feedback is the foundation of excellent teaching. When you know exactly where your pupils are in relation to where you want them to be, you can make informed decisions about how to adapt your teaching, what feedback to give pupils and what to plan next so that pupils improve more rapidly than they would otherwise.

There has been a lot written about the impact of assessment and feedback on workload in recent years with a major benefit that we know more now than we ever have about which techniques are effective and sustainable for classroom teachers. This Block draws on all of this research to develop your practice.

## Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs

Imagine watching someone complete a rock-climbing wall, blindfolded. They could certainly feel their way and depending on their previous experience and skill they might make it to the top. However, with a partner below to guide them, assessing where they were struggling and giving specific and useful steps to move them forward, they would be more likely to complete the wall. Good assessment and feedback in the classroom is like that from the climbing guide – you can see the whole picture, identify where your climbers (pupils) are stuck, give useful feedback to move them forward or offer alternative routes to get to the same destination.

Why do you need to think about assessment every day and not just at the end of term or end of topics?

Assessment is so much more than just a record of what your pupils have learned. Although this will be an element of your classroom practice and a mechanism through which you can show pupils’ progress, ongoing assessment of what your pupils understand and what they need next is one of the most important things you can do as a teacher. This type of assessment, gathering information to inform what you teach and improve learning, is often known as _formative assessment._

Based on a review of over 250 research articles from various countries, Black and Wiliam (2004) concluded that few initiatives in education have a stronger evidence base than formative assessment as a strategy for raising achievement.

Pupil assessment can be used to provide vital information to teachers about pupils’ learning. When used in this way, formative assessment is a crucial component of teaching, which has a positive impact on pupil learning (Black et al., 2004; Coe, 2013; Speckesser et al., 2018). It helps teachers decide:

- What pupils are learning and their current understanding
- How they should respond to pupils’ prior knowledge
- What to do about pupil misconceptions
- How and when to introduce new learning
- What further support a pupil might need.

(Sadler, 1989; Harlen & James, 1997; Black et al., 2004;
Black & Wiliam, 2009; Christodoulou, 2017)

Of course, this information is only useful if you do something with it. Adapting your teaching (something you explored in Block 3) and giving useful feedback to pupils so that they can improve their work is what makes “assessment and feedback two of the most important strategies that teachers use to support pupils’ learning.” (Hattie, 2017)

Unfortunately, assessment and feedback are not always done well, as Professor Rob Coe has observed:

$I

<em>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    It is now a rare thing, in my experience, to meet any teacher in England who
    would not claim to be doing [formative] Assessment... And yet, the evidence…
    suggests that during the fifteen years of this intensive intervention to
    promote [formative] Assessment, despite its near universal adoption and
    strong research evidence of substantial impact on attainment, there has been
    no (or at best limited) effect on learning outcomes nationally.
  </span>
</em>
<p style="text-align: right;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Coe (2013)</span>
</p>
$I

Why might this be? It’s unlikely to be down to teachers’ good intentions and effort, but it is easy to focus on the wrong things. If assessment fails to improve pupils’ learning, it has missed the point.

So, what is “good assessment” and what is “good feedback”?

## Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.

Good assessment will be absolutely clear on what it is looking for. It can be easy to be misled by the appearance of pupils in a calm and productive classroom. As we saw in Block 2, learning is something that happens inside pupils’ heads: the process is therefore invisible to an observer. Pupils need to think hard about material in order to learn it, and – from the outside – this can take many forms. Therefore, the fact that pupils look busy and engaged does not tell us what they have learned (Wiliam, 2010; Coe, 2013).

Poor “proxies for learning” (Coe, 2013) are behaviours that we might observe in classrooms and automatically assume the learning we intended for our pupils is happening. For example, we might observe pupils highly engaged in an activity and make an assumption that the learning we planned has taken place. If your assessment of the success of your lesson was based on the extent to which pupils appeared to enjoy the task and the number who completed it, you would be missing vital information about whether your learning objectives had been achieved and what pupils had learned.

Consider Pictures A, B and C below. Which pupils are “learning best”?

$EndFigure

By just looking at the pictures, you might make some assumptions about this – your assumptions might be true but they could also be wrong. Therefore, to avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors we must **assess** learning through activities, homework and tests to objectively identify what pupils know, understand and can do.

## Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.

Good assessment will always have a clear purpose. There is a lot to do as a teacher and so prioritising your time on activities that help and support learning is essential. The research is clear that using formative assessment can help to improve outcomes. However, assessment can often be time-consuming and burdensome, with large amounts of unproductive data collection and analysis (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017; Gibson et al., 2015).

Therefore, to reduce the time spent on assessment that does _not_ benefit pupil learning, before doing any assessment task you should be clear about:

- What the assessment will be used to support
- What information will be gained from the assessment activity
- How the information gathered will be used.

Taken from Wiliam & Leahy (2015).

You make multiple decisions a day as a teacher, even multiple decisions during every lesson. Assessment should be used to support your decision making – what to teach and what not to teach. If you are carrying out an assessment task, you should be clear about the reason why. But what does this look like in practice?

The types of questions you might use assessment to answer could include:

$I

<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      What do my pupils already know about this topic?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      What difficulties do my pupils have with this concept/skill?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      What expertise do my pupils have already related to this concept/skill?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Do my pupils have any misconceptions related to this concept/skill?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Have my pupils understood the key ideas we have been learning about?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Can I move onto the next step in the learning?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Can my pupils link ideas to work we have done previously?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">What have my pupils learned today?</span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      How will I use the responses from pupils to inform my planning and
      teaching?
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
$I

Consider the following example:

$I

<h3>Example</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher A is going to be starting a new topic on Henry VIII. Before she begins
  teaching she wants to know how much her pupils know about the Tudors already
  as some of them covered it in the previous year. Therefore, she will create an
  assessment on Tudors. The purpose of this assessment will be to check prior
  knowledge and work out pupil starting points. From talking to her colleagues,
  she has established that another teacher has created a short multiple-choice
  quiz about the Tudors. Teacher A decides to use this and adapt it to suit what
  she wants to see if pupils know. Once pupils have completed this quiz, the
  teacher will be able to clearly see the starting point of her pupils and will
  be able to plan or adapt her lessons to draw on and develop this learning.

One way of informing your assessment planning is to work with your colleagues to identify efficient and effective approaches to assessment. Colleagues will be able to provide ideas they have found work well with your pupils, especially in terms of how they manage to gather evidence from _all_ pupils in the class and then use this to make decisions about what next in their teaching. The video that follows gives some examples of the types of things experienced teachers do in this area.

<strong>Teacher 1:</strong> At the end of each lesson I give my pupils two questions.
One a calculation problem and the other a worded problem. This helps me identify
who needs to spend time learning a procedure or concept. This tells me what I need
to focus my attention on in the next lesson and helps me quickly identify which pupils
need extra support from me.

<strong>Teacher 2:</strong> After I have taught a key skill, I ask specific questions
in the lesson, which I will have prepared in advance, to check pupils' understanding.
I word my questions to help me identify specific misconceptions which I can then
pre-empt in the planning process. This is a quick way of assessing pupils’ understanding
and misconceptions in all lessons and means that I don’t have to spend hours and
hours marking to find out what pupils know! It also means I can adapt my teaching
in the moment rather than a delay between assessing and feeding back.

<strong>Teacher 3:</strong> At key points, maybe every third or fourth lesson, I
plan a simple question to ask at the end of class. Sometimes this is an open question
that requires a very short answer, and sometimes this is a multiple-choice with carefully
chosen distractors. Either way, I’m looking to expose common misconceptions, and
using my subject knowledge to guide what these are likely to be. I give out post-its
or little cards and the pupils hand me their answers as they leave the lesson. This
allows me to have a few words as they go out, and is a nice way to end the session.
I then read through their answers, sometimes there and then for a snapshot of progress,
or later when I’m planning the next lesson I can sort the tickets into three piles:
1. Pupils who have understood, 2. Pupils who have sort of understood, 3. Pupils who
have not understood. This gives me the big picture quickly and easily. It helps me
know my starting point for the next set of lessons, and what misconceptions are likely
to persist. $EndContent $EndAccordion

## To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.

Have you ever spent an entire evening diligently marking a set of books with detailed feedback and next steps for pupils? Have you handed the books back out, proud of the feedback you have given, only to move onto the next lesson and realise later that pupils are making the exact same mistakes as before and that your hours of marking feels like a waste of time?

This is one of the greatest errors we make as teachers. If you are going to take the time to provide feedback to pupils then you need to allow time for pupils to act on it otherwise you will not help pupils to improve. Therefore, good assessment needs to both provide you with _useful_ information (i.e. you can put it to use) and it also needs to provide actionable information for your pupils.

Dylan Wiliam and Paul Black’s work _Inside the Black Box_, published in 1998, is considered the seminal text in relation to assessment and has influenced assessment practices in schools up and down the country. At times, however, these practices did not reflect the research they were based on:

$I

<em>
  <strong>
    At its core, formative assessment stressed the need for assessment to be
    something that teachers and students respond to in order to reflect and
    adapt their practice but in too many cases, the “assessment”... became more
    about collecting data than improving outcomes
  </strong>
</em>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  <em>
    <strong>.</strong> Indeed, Wiliam would later say that he should have used
    the term “responsive teaching” rather than formative assessment.
  </em>

For assessment to be of value you need to provide **feedback** to pupils on how to improve their work and then crucially, give time for pupils to either improve the previous piece of work or apply the feedback to a new piece of work.

Watch the video below and consider:

- How does the teacher provide opportunities for pupils to respond to feedback during lessons? What are the steps they follow?
- How do you provide opportunities for pupils to respond to feedback in your classroom?

<strong>Teacher 1:</strong> When I first started teaching I felt so frustrated that
all the time I spent marking books was pointless. After I marked a piece of work
and handed it back, pupils would spend a couple of minutes looking at my feedback
– but mainly focused on a mark or grade if I gave one – and then they would turn
over onto a new page and we would start the next piece of work. They hardly ever
did anything with my comments and so I found myself writing out the same comments
over and over again.

I made a change a few years ago after speaking to a more experienced colleague who helped me to see that I wasn’t giving any real opportunity for pupils to actually respond to my feedback and so they considered it case closed. Now I think about assessment and feedback as one continuous loop – when I mark a piece of work I am assessing what pupils can do and what they need to do next, I provide feedback on this and then they have to have the opportunity to improve it so I can assess if they have moved forward. I like to give one essay title and pupils will submit maybe three to four drafts of the same essay to me over the term, each time improving the same essay based on the feedback they get. This helps both me and the pupils to see the progress they are making. It works really well and I no longer feel like my feedback is a waste of time, pupils actually use it to improve their work!

<strong>Teacher 2:</strong> I often set my pupils a set of problems to solve to check
their learning. I used to mark each individual pupil’s work and write out corrections
and examples in each of their books which took a really long time. Sometimes I would
take so long to mark the full set of books that we had moved on in the curriculum
and the motivation for pupils to respond to the feedback was gone.

I now use a much more efficient approach which means pupils get feedback a lot quicker so they can act on it and it still feels relevant to the learning we are doing. I first saw this approach at a subject network meeting and I’ve used it ever since – I mark pupils work but I just put a code (like a square or a star) next to the questions they got wrong based on an error. I then prepare one slide or print out which has the code and a worked example/explanation of the mistake. For example, the star shows that pupils have made an error with their units in the problem. Pupils are all given a copy of the class feedback and they have time to correct their work. An unintended outcome, which I didn’t expect, was pupils have started to help each other and ask others in their group who didn’t get that code to help them if they are stuck! It’s led to some really meaningful responses to feedback and pupils take it really seriously.

## High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.

So, feedback has to give pupils a chance to act on it. What else do we know about high quality feedback? To support pupils’ learning, feedback does not have to be provided in writing by the teacher.

High-quality feedback, whether it is written or verbal, needs to:

- Be accurate and clear
- Encourage further effort
- Provide specific guidance on _how_ to improve.

High-quality feedback is explicit about what is involved in achieving success in a task _and_ what pupils need to do to improve (Sadler, 1989; Hattie, 2009). It has a positive impact on learner outcomes by providing specific, actionable guidance for pupils to improve their learning (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996; Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Hattie, 2014; EEF, 2018).

## Feedback should:

| Be accurate and clear                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Encourage further effort                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Provide specific guidance                                                                                                         |

| - Clear, simple language - Clarify learning intentions and criteria for success - Be linked to the learning goal they are working towards - Outline what success looks like - Be clear on how pupils will know when they have got there. | - Praise pupils for the parts that were done well - Ask pupils to do something further to their work - Highlight approaches that helped pupils to be successful, which they could use in other tasks: over time this can support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning. | - Provide clear actions to further improve their work - Provide further scaffolding (e.g. examples) or challenge (e.g. now try…). |

Done well, verbal feedback from teacher to pupil in class has the dual benefit of being both effective _and_ efficient. As it is given in the moment it also reduces “waiting time” between the mistake or error and the feedback the pupil receives. This means teachers are able to respond quickly with additional support to individuals as appropriate (Black et al., 2004; Gibson et al., 2015) and there is less chance of the pupil repeating the mistake and therefore reinforcing it.

NARRATION
A practical strategy that you can use to provide high-quality feedback to your pupils is live marking. This will allow in the moment feedback and opportunities for pupils to reflect on their work and improve it.

CLASSROOM INTERACTION
In our last lesson, you prepared your plans for your descriptive writing. You are writing a description of the woods using all the techniques we have been working on over the term. As you are writing, I am going to be walking around and marking your work as you are writing. This will be an excellent opportunity for you to adapt and improve your work as you go, so make sure you listen carefully and respond to the feedback I give you.

Excellent first line, Abdul, I like that you have used a great adjective to describe the atmosphere.

(Writing) Check your spelling here.

Can you add in an adverb to describe how you are walking?

(Writing) Check your punctuation.

Callum, I really like that you have used a simile to describe the trees moving, that really brings the forest alive.

(Writing) Missing punctuation here.

(Writing) Can you add a descriptive technique to describe the path here?

Not all feedback will be able to be provided verbally. Written feedback is still a common way for teachers to communicate with their pupils. A recent focus on effective marking from the EEF (2016) makes some recommendations emerging from the evidence, which could aid teachers when thinking about effective, sustainable approaches to marking:

- Careless mistakes should be marked differently to errors resulting from misunderstandings. The former should just be marked as incorrect with no right answer supplied, the latter addressed through hints or questions, which lead pupils to the underlying principles.
- Awarding grades for every piece of work takes away from the impact of marking as pupils can become obsessed by the grade at the expense of formative comments.
- Using targets to make marking as specific and actionable as possible is likely to increase pupil progress.
- Pupils are unlikely to benefit from written feedback unless time has been set aside to respond to it.
- Acknowledgement marking (e.g. ticking every page) is unlikely to promote better progress. You would be better to mark fewer pieces but mark them in more detail.

<h3>Example A</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">7/10. Good.</span>
<h2>Example B</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Great job – you have worked hard! Next time try to check your spelling as you
  go.
</span>
<h2>Example C</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This is a good piece of work – you have used new vocabulary correctly in your
  writing.
</span>
<h2>Example D</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You have focused on improving the level of detail in your explanations. This
  is much better than last time. Your next target is to use a greater variety of
  descriptive words.
</span>
<h2>Example E</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You have explained one of the key ideas well. To gain full marks, there are
  two other ideas you should explain. For example, why does the theme of
  loneliness keep coming up? How does the relationship between the main
  characters develop during the book?

As well as focusing on specific actions for pupils, it is important that you provide adequate time for pupils to respond to feedback.

One effective strategy for dealing with this is to use DIRT (Directed Improvement and Reflection Time). In simple terms, this is intentionally getting pupils to respond to your marking and expecting pupils to do something with your comments. Typically, this normally happens at the beginning of the lesson as close to the feedback being given.

## Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

The ability to ask good questions is – arguably – the most important tool in a teacher’s toolkit. We use them a lot – questioning is the most widely used form of teacher-pupil interaction (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). Significantly, more effective teachers “ask a large number of questions and check the responses of all students” (Rosenshine, 2012). Rosenshine’s research findings concluded that “the most successful teachers in these studies spent more than half the time lecturing, demonstrating, and asking questions” (ibid).

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Questions allow a teacher to determine how well the material has been learned
  and whether there is a need for additional instruction. The most effective
  teachers also ask students to explain the process they used to answer the
  question, to explain how the answer was found. Less successful teachers ask
  fewer questions and almost no process questions.

Thinking back to what you learned in Block 2 about memory, you already know that learning happens when we are able to connect new knowledge to prior knowledge and present new concepts in easy to understand steps. Questions support both of these things. We can use them to check what pupils already know. We can use them to check that pupils are following our explanations and are ready for us to move on. And where they don’t understand, we can use questions to break these problematic concepts down further. They can also encourage pupils to think hard – a key factor in learning. With our prompting, pupils can be encouraged to articulate their understanding of key ideas, summarising and reformulating them in order to reinforce their knowledge.

<h3>Case study – using questions</h3>
In one classroom-based experimental study, one group of teachers was taught to follow
the presentation of new material with lots of questions. They were taught to increase
the number of factual questions and process questions they asked during this guided
practice. Test results showed that their students achieved higher scores than did
students whose teachers did not receive the training.

<strong>Factual questions:</strong> Tests pupils on their knowledge of key information,
these questions have one correct answer. “What date did World War One begin?” “What
is 3x5?” “What is one stage of the water cycle?”

<strong>Process questions:</strong> Tests pupils on their depth of knowledge and
understanding. They require analysis/opinion from the pupil. “How does the reader
feel about Lennie at this point in the novel?” “What is the best way to solve this
problem? How do you know?” “Can you compare the way colour is used in these pictures?”

Imaginative teachers have found ways to involve all students in answering questions. Examples include having all students:

<ul>
  <li>Tell the answer to a neighbour</li>
  <li>
    Summarise the main ideas in one or two sentences, writing the summary on a
    piece of paper and sharing this with a neighbour, or repeating the
    procedures to a neighbour
  </li>
  <li>Write the answer on a card and then hold it up</li>
  <li>
    Raise their hands if they know the answer (allowing the teacher to check the
    entire class)
  </li>
  <li>
    Raise their hands if they agree with the answer that someone else has given.
  </li>
</ul>
Across the classrooms that the researchers observed, the purpose of all these procedures
was to provide active participation for the students and also to allow the teacher
to see how many students were correct and confident. The teacher may then reteach
some material when it was considered necessary. An alternative was for students to
write their answers and then trade papers with each other.

Other teachers used choral responses to provide sufficient practice when teaching new vocabulary or lists of items. This made the practice seem more like a game. To be effective, however, all students needed to start together, on a signal. When students did not start together, only the faster students answered.

In addition to asking questions, the more effective teachers facilitated their students’ rehearsal by providing explanations, giving more examples, and supervising students as they practised new material.

## The section that follows describes some of the key types of questions and how they can be used to achieve these goals:

### 1. Open versus closed questions

In broad terms, we can think of two main types of questioning: closed questions and open questions. When teachers ask a question with a relatively straightforward answer such as, “In the novel, did George shoot Lennie?”, this is considered a closed question. An open question typically elicits longer responses where students need to reflect and use more complex reasoning, such as “Was George justified in shooting Lennie?”. While it may be tempting to think that open questions are “better” than closed questions, both play an important role in the overall learning process.

$I

<h3>Closed and open questions</h3>
<strong>Closed questions</strong> can be useful for checking recall of facts or
to check simple understanding. They can be asked at pace and keep pupils focused
on the lesson.

<strong>Open questions</strong> allow for more developed responses and can be used
to check that pupils' correct answers stem from a secure understanding. They enable
pupils to explain their thinking and explore what they know and understand. $I

Consider these questions:

    Which of these questions provide the teacher with information that they can
    use to provide feedback?
  </li>
  <li>Why?</li>
</ul>
$CTA

- **Example A**, a closed question, does not give much useful information about whether pupils have understood what has been taught: they can simply answer “yes” or “no”. They might say they have understood even if they haven’t.
- Closed questions can be used to scaffold pupils’ learning by providing clues to the answer, as in **Example B**.
- **Example C**, an open question, allows the teacher to assess what pupils understand and what they have not.

Other starting points for open questions include:

- How can you explain…?
- Why do you think…?
- Why does this… ?
- What would you add to the previous answer?
- What do you think would happen if… ?
- How could we find out… ?
- What did you mean when you said… ?
- Tell me more about… ?
- How do you know that…?
- Why did you choose… ?

Pupil: “It was the Great Depression.”

Teacher: “Yes, well done, can you say a bit more about what the Great Depression was like?”

Pupil: “It was triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 when stock prices fell. It had devastating effects on people – lots of people lost all their money and ended up living in poverty. Farmers and rural communities suffered a lot because crop prices fell.”

### 2. Hinge questions

We often want to assess whether pupils understand a key idea before we move on. When this is the case, we can use a hinge question. These are questions that reliably check pupils’ knowledge or understanding and quickly give teachers information to decide whether and how to move on with the topic being taught.

Hinge questions often take the form of multiple-choice questions. Multiple choice questions are a great way to check pupils' knowledge and understanding and identify misconceptions. However, they need careful planning, so that they:

- Do not allow pupils to get the right answers for the wrong reason; i.e. pupils should not be able to guess or work out the correct answers because of the way the question is written, they should only be able to get the correct answers based on their understanding of the concept
- Ensure every option in the question provides the teacher with valuable evidence of pupils’ thinking – if pupils get the wrong answer, it tells the teacher something very important.
- Are written to focus on “troublesome” knowledge i.e. things that pupils are known to find difficult or common misconceptions that pupils may hold
- Indicate both correct thinking and gaps in pupils’ knowledge or misconceptions.

$I

<h3>Hinge question examples</h3>
<h4>1. Science</h4>
In which part of a daffodil does photosynthesis occur?
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li>All of the daffodil</li>
  <li>The leaves and petals</li>
  <li>The leaves and roots</li>
  <li>The leaves and stem</li>
  <li>Just the leaves</li>
</ol>
Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, which are found in green leaves and
stems of plants. Pupils will need to understand that this is not restricted to
the leaves (E) and that petals and roots do not contain chloroplasts (B/C).
<h4>2. French</h4>
Which of these translations is/are correct for the text below? L’été dernier, ma
sœur avait un petit job donc elle est restée chez nous.
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li>Last summer, my sister had a small job so stayed at our house.</li>
  <li>Last summer, my sister had a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>
  <li>Last summer my sister had a job, therefore she stayed at ours.</li>
  <li>This summer, my sister has a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>
  <li>This summer, my sister had a part-time job so stayed at our house.</li>
</ol>
The correct answer here is B – Last summer, my sister had a part-time job so
stayed at our house. This checks that pupils have a good understanding of tense
(this is in the past) so “last summer” not “this summer”. It checks that pupils
understand that chez nous means “our house”. It also checks that “petit job” is
understood as a part-time job as opposed to the literal translation of a small
job.
<h4>3. History</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li>
    Which of these pairs of dates in ordinary numerals and Roman numerals is/are
    correct?
  </li>
  <li>1996 – MCMXCVI</li>
  <li>1332 – MCCCXXXII</li>
  <li>1514 – MDXVI</li>
  <li>2019 – MIIXIX</li>
</ol>
A and B are correct. 1514 is actually 1516, which checks that pupils understand that
a I before a V means 4 whereas a I coming after a V means 6. The last one is incorrect
as it uses MII instead of MM. $I

Hinge questions can be used before, during or following exposition. Pupils may respond verbally, in writing, or through an action or activity of some kind, through individual or whole class responses, for example on whiteboards, on paper, using technology or using hand signals.

For example, with the questions above, the teacher could ask pupils to raise their hands when the teacher says the correct answer. If they don’t want pupils to copy others’ answers, they could ask pupils to close their eyes while answering or answer electronically.

NARRATION

Hinge questions are questions which reliably check pupils’ knowledge or understanding and quickly give teachers information to decide whether and how to move on with the topic being taught.

They can be used before, during or following exposition. Pupils may respond verbally, in writing, or through an action or activity of some kind, through individual or whole class responses, for example on whiteboards, on paper, using technology or using hand signals.

Hinge questions are a great way for us to assess whether pupils understand a key idea before we move on.

CLASSROOM INTERACTION

We have been learning about magnetic fields and I want to see how much you know. I am going to ask you a question and read out four potential answers. When you hear the one that you think is correct, put your hand in the air. I will be asking questions after to check your thinking.

Which object can be picked up with a magnet?

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
  <li>An iron nail.</li>
  <li>A copper wire.</li>
  <li>A piece of wood.</li>
  <li>A piece of glass.</li>
</ol>
Harry, I saw you put your hand up for (A) an iron nail. Can you tell me why you think
that is correct? $EndContent $EndAccordion

You will have further opportunities to practise hinge questions with your mentor in Session 5.3.

### 3. Follow-on questions

We can scaffold, extend or challenge pupils’ thinking by reframing questions. One way to do this is to use follow-on questions. The type of follow-on question, and how much guidance it offers to pupils, will depend on pupils' knowledge and understanding.

For pupils who need more support, more scaffolding is appropriate and the form is more likely to be a closed question; for those who need further stretch, we can ask open questions that encourage them to explore their answers further or respond to each other’s answers.

$I

<h3>Example: Forces</h3>
Pupils are going to be studying the topic “forces” and learning how balanced and
unbalanced forces affect an object. This learning will then be built on to develop
an understanding about Newton’s laws of motion, with quantitative approaches to calculating
answers taught last.

The teacher has planned a series of questions to use: some are to scaffold the necessary knowledge needed; other questions are to stretch the pupil’s thinking by getting them to explain, analyse, apply and link ideas.

<h4>Questions that scaffold knowledge</h4>

  <li>Where do contact forces act on an object?</li>
  <li>Where do non-contact forces act on an object?</li>
  <li>What is a resultant force?</li>
</ul>

## High quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.

$I
Of all the debates in education one of the most contentious is the amount of time teachers should spend talking versus the amount of time students should spend talking. Research in this field is notoriously tricky; it is very difficult to grasp the import of spoken work with all its complexities and nuances.

<p style="text-align: right;">Lemov &amp; Robinson (2017)</p>
$I

While there are interesting arguments about the type and quantity of “talk” that is optimal in classrooms – you will see very different dynamics in different schools for example – at a basic level pupils “need to practise new material. The teacher’s questions and student discussion are a major way of providing this necessary practice.” (Rosenshine, 2012). Beyond this there are a number of other benefits that high quality classroom talk can deliver, providing pupils with the opportunity to:

- Practise using new vocabulary in full sentences and in different contexts
- Articulate their ideas, thoughts or feelings
- Explore and consolidate a new idea or topic through dialogue
- Expand and deepen their understanding of a concept
- Learn social skills such as having a conversation, taking turns, making a point and responding to other alternative viewpoints.

$I
The most recent large scale study on classroom talk carried out by the Cambridge Primary Review Trust and the University of York funded by EEF found that “dialogic teaching”, where teachers were trained on strategies which enabled pupils to “reason, discuss, argue and explain rather than merely respond, in order to develop high order thinking and articulacy”, found on average, students gained an additional two months’ learning compared to groups who did not receive the intervention.

<p style="text-align: right;">Lemov &amp; Robinson (2017)</p>
$I

So perhaps the key question then is: what makes classroom talk “high quality”?

Robin Alexander, a well-known proponent of dialogic teaching (2004), distinguishes five central elements of effective classroom talk as being “collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative and purposeful.”

| Element of classroom talk | What does it look like in the classroom?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collective                | - Teacher and pupils engage together in dialogue as opposed to the teacher doing all of the taking. - Anyone in the classroom can offer ideas, agree or disagree, ask questions or extend thinking. - The teacher must set up the expectations and encourage pupils to engage in active dialogue rather than passive listening.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Reciprocal                | - Pupils must listen to each other so they can respond. - Pupils might react to each other's ideas with their own viewpoint or a different suggestion. - Answers should be justified and built upon by other pupils.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Supportive                | - All contributions should be valued and respected. - The teacher might introduce group discussion guidelines for pupils to adhere to. - Even better, the pupils could negotiate these themselves so they have greater ownership and agency of the classroom talk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cumulative                | - In contrast to closed questions and recall, open-ended questions allow ideas to be explored and built upon. - The teacher might help link previous learning and ideas to deepen understanding. - It may be thought of as a continuous conversation throughout a lesson, a scheme of work or over an academic year – new ideas build on previous contributions.                                                                                                                         |
| Purposeful                | - The teacher should have a goal in mind for any classroom talk – is it to explore a new idea, deepen understanding, reflect or clarify? - The talk should be well planned, including protocols such as how to contribute, length of time for the discussion and what happens next. - The teacher plays an important role to skillfully manage any classroom talk and keep it focused on the purpose intended – this might include giving sentence stems or facilitating the discussion. |

## Area 1: Avoid common assessment pitfalls

### By trying this activity, you will...

#### Learn how to: **Avoid common assessment pitfalls, by:**

- 6a Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps)
- 6b Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance)
- 6c Choosing, where possible, externally validated materials, used in controlled conditions when required to make summative assessments

### If this is successful, you will see...

- Pupils who are familiar and well-versed in what their external assessments will look and feel like.
- Pupils who are confident about sitting external assessments.
- Pupils make better progress against lesson objectives as you make more accurate assessments
- Patterns emerge for individual pupils and across your class across a number of assessments enabling you to make better informed decisions about what to spend time on.

### Practise...

#### Plan formative assessment

- Review a lesson you plan to teach soon.
- What are the lesson objectives – i.e. what do pupils need to leave this lesson knowing?
- Write a good hinge question for each of the lesson objectives.
- Plan where the hinge questions will sit within the flow of the lesson.

#### Analyse patterns of performance

- Work with a colleague in the same phase or subject as yourself.
- Consider all the points in the year when you will collect data linked to a particular learning target (e.g. writing in full paragraphs, written methods for multiplication, analysing a source).
- You may choose to use a spreadsheet or tracker for your class to record against each assessment point how well each pupil could do the learning objective (you could use your own school’s assessment descriptors or a simple “never, sometimes, usually, always”).
- After each assessment point, review your tracker (ideally with a more experienced colleague) asking the following questions:Which pupils have made progress?

- - Which pupils have stayed the same or reduced?
  - What factors may have influenced those who made progress? (e.g. Were they all sitting together? Did they get a particular intervention?)
  - What do you need to do to support those pupils who have not yet made progress?

#### Use externally validated resources

Summative assessments, like SATs, GCSEs and A levels, give a snapshot of pupils’ performance at a specific point in time. Summative assessment can evaluate pupil learning and provide evidence of their achievement. These assessments can also be used formatively, to provide feedback which helps pupils to improve.

For summative assessments to be most useful, they should be standardised, carefully developed and tested, implemented in controlled conditions, and assess the learning you want to find out about. You may be able to access sample and past assessments from awarding organisations for external examinations. These assessments have been carefully tested for reliability and validity and are often accompanied by reports which help teachers to understand common errors and misconceptions.

**Think about an upcoming series of lessons in which you would like to assess pupils’ learning and work through the questions here.
**

- Is there an externally validated or widely used in-school assessment that I can use? If not, what task can I use instead?
- Does the task test the understanding or knowledge I want to assess?
- Will all pupils be able to understand the language used in the task?
- Will pupils respond to the task in the same way?
- Will the task give me reliable information: if the class did it again on another day would they get different outcomes?
- If another teacher’s class did the task would their results be comparable?
- Is the mark scheme clear and can I use it to help pupils understand their marks?
- Should the task be carried out in class, under controlled conditions, with open books, or at home?
- How much time should be given?
- Should I mark the task, or could it be peer-assessed, self-assessed or assessed by a colleague?
- How will I prepare the pupils for the task?

If you teach a subject in secondary school at GCSE or A-level, there are many externally validated assessments that can be used in the form of past papers.

- You should search the exam board that your pupils are sitting their exam in.
- You should speak to colleagues in your department about how they use these resources.
- Some of the exam board sites require logins – your school can organise this for you.

For example:

[GCSE | English Language | Assessment resources](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/english/gcse/english-language-8700/assessment-resources)

Edexcel past papers on a range of topics KS4 and 5 (Account required): [Past papers | Past exam papers](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/exams/past-papers.html)

**[GCSE - Geography B (Geography for Enquiring Minds) (9-1) - J384 (from 2016)](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse/geography-b-geography-for-enquiring-minds-j384-from-2016/assessment/) (Login required)**

#### Practise summative assessments in controlled conditions

- In order to increase the reliability and validity of summative assessments, efforts should be made to do these in controlled conditions which are replicated.
- Your school may have a policy on this which you can look at.

For example:

- How will pupils enter the classroom?
- What will they be allowed on their desks?
- Will there be complete silence for the whole lesson? What happens if a pupil does not adhere to this?
- What should pupils do when they think they have finished?

## Area 2: Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding

### By trying this activity, you will…

#### Learn how to: Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding, by:

- 4m Including a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (e.g. by modelling new vocabulary or asking pupils to justify answers)
- 4n Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required

### If this is successful, you will see…

- Questions being asked from pupils to teacher and pupils to pupils.
- Pupils are confident to air their thinking.
- Pupils are confident to make mistakes and being encouraged to do so.
- Questioning that builds on previous knowledge.
- Activities that engage all pupils in talking and responding to the question.

### Practise…

#### Pose-pause-pounce

- Teacher poses a question, e.g. _“Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport, how much about the past could we find out about?”_
- Teacher pauses while pupils have thinking time or paired discussion, e.g. _“Discuss what you are thinking with your partner.”_ They might pay attention to the talk between pupils.
- Teacher pounces on a pupil/group to see what they think e.g. _“So what does this group think?” \_or_ “I think I like what you’re talking about here, can you explain that to me?”\_

Bounce the idea round the room asking pupils to build or challenge on what’s already been said, e.g. _“This group has said something really interesting. Ollie, can you explain? What does everyone else think about that? Eliza, do you agree with Ollie? Does anyone disagree?”_

#### Use follow up questions

If pupils supply you with responses that could do with a greater level of elaboration and/or sophistication, instead of accepting the response, you can add a follow up question to their answer so that they are challenged to go beyond their initial thinking.

For example:

Teacher:_ What did you put for the answer to 4c?_

Pupil: _I put 244._

Teacher:_ Thank you, how did you arrive at that answer?_

In the next lesson you teach, try to do this five times.

#### Use increased wait time

Increase the wait time you give pupils after you have asked your question. It takes practice to feel confident not filling the silence but if you do, pupils will know that if they dawdle, they won’t have to answer a question.

One way to practise achieving a longer wait time is to count down in your head slowly from 10 to 1. Tell pupils you will be doing this and ask them not to put their hands up until the end of their thinking time.

It could also be helpful to ask a peer or your mentor to observe you and to time how long you actually wait for pupils to respond.

In the next lesson you teach, use a stopwatch/timer to practise ensuring that you provide adequate wait time for pupils.

## Area 3: Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons

### By trying this activity, you will…

#### Learn how to: Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons, by:

- 6d Using assessments to check for prior knowledge and pre-existing misconceptions
- 6e Structuring tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions)
- 6f Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding
- 6g Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions

### If this is successful, you will see…

- Pupils are clear on what they have done well
- Pupils are clear on what specifically they need to do next in order to improve
- Pupils want to improve their work
- Pupils are not disheartened if their work needs improvement
- Pupils considering improvement as part of the learning experience

### Practise…

#### Multiple-choice quiz

For a lesson you have coming up, develop a multiple-choice quiz that you could use at the beginning of the lesson to check for prior knowledge – this can include the security of that knowledge.

For example, the teacher has taught one lesson in a sequence of lessons on the Battle of Hastings. He uses the following multiple-choice questions to test pupils' knowledge as they go into lesson 2.

1. _Why might Harold’s army have been tired before the Battle of Hastings?_

   - They had recently fought Harald Hadrada.
   - They had recently fought King Cnut.
   - They had recently fought William Duke of Normandy.

2. _What other reason did Harold’s army have for being tired?_

   - They had marched to and from London Bridge.
   - They had marched to and from Stamford Bridge.
   - They had marched to and from Severn Bridge.

3. _What advantages did William’s army have ahead of the battle?_

   - They were a large army of mostly amateur soldiers.
   - They arrived early and positioned themselves atop Senlac Hill.
   - They were well equipped with horses and weapons.

#### 5 quick questions/If this is the answer, what’s the question?

For a lesson you have coming up, develop a series of 5 quick questions you could ask to check for pupils prior knowledge.

For example, taking the same history lesson as above:

1. Who had Harold fought ahead of the Battle of Hastings?
2. Where did this battle take place?
3. What other reason did Harold’s army have for being tired before the Battle of Hastings?
4. Name one advantage William had over Harold.
5. Name another.

Another way you could do this is: **If this is the answer, what is the question. **In this activity, you provide the pupils with the answers, and they need to devise the questions. Pupils typically find this a more difficult activity because it requires a greater depth of understanding in order to construct the question. For example:

1. Harald Hadrada
2. Stamford Bridge
3. They had to march all the way to and from Stamford Bridge and then to Hastings.
4. His army had very good weapons.
5. His army had horses.

#### Live marking

- Set an activity for your pupils.
- While pupils are working, circulate and review what pupils are doing, offering feedback to each pupil that identifies a clear action for improvement.
- Give pupils time to improve their work based on your feedback.
- You could also use marking codes here if pupils are familiar with them, e.g. tick for something correct, circle for something that needs to be corrected.

## Instructions

- Use this time to plan and carry out some observations of colleagues or be observed yourself. Record what you plan to do yourself in your practice as a result.
- In your mentor session 5.6, you will have a chance to reflect on what you learn from observing other colleagues or being observed yourself.
- You might choose to observe or be observed on one of the foci below or on a range of the foci.
- Use the suggested observation ideas below to plan your observations. You don’t need to do all of them but choose the one(s) that you feel will be most helpful – your mentor can help you plan this.
- You can use the [adaptable observation handout (PDF)](http://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/adaptable-handout-2-lesson-observation-template/) to make notes on the observation.
- You could use video to carry out your observations. Videoing your lessons gives you the opportunity to review what is happening in your classroom and see for yourself which strategies are most effective. You can share the video with your mentor.

| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use of assessment to expose misconceptions          | - How does the teacher use assessment strategies, such as hinge or multiple-choice questions, to expose misconceptions? - What does the teacher do after they assess whether there is or is not a misconception? - What benefits does this bring to the pupils? - What might you do as a result of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Monitoring pupils’ work during lessons              | - What does the teacher do to monitor pupils’ work during the lesson? - Does the teacher use verbal or written feedback or both? - How do pupils respond? - What is the impact of the teacher monitoring during lessons? - What might you do as a result of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Using a range of questions and the use of wait time | - What different kinds of questions does the teacher use in the lesson, e.g. open, closed, hinge/multiple-choice, follow-on etc. - When do different kinds of questions get deployed? - How involved are the pupils in answering? - Does the teacher do anything to structure the answering of the question, e.g. using paired discussion before responding? - How long does the teacher typically wait between asking the question and the answer - Could the teacher wait longer in any instances - What might you do as a result of this? |
| High-quality classroom talk                         | - What does the teacher do in the lesson to promote talk that is of high-quality, e.g. the use of sentence stems, word banks, paired discussion - What is the purpose of the classroom talk? - How do the talk activities support pupil understanding? - What might you do as a result of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Prompting pupils to elaborate on their responses    | - Does the teacher prompt pupils to extend their responses if they are insufficiently detailed? - How is this done? - What is the effect? - Does the teacher do anything in advance of asking the question to ensure pupils do elaborate on responses without prompts? - What might you do as a result of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

$Content
It is a fact that high quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils' life chances; the progress you have made as an effective teacher, and continue to make, will support your pupils long after they leave your classroom. Some of your pupils have very specific needs such as special educational needs, others need additional support to overcome disadvantage; all should be treated as individuals who will learn and can achieve success if they are given the right support. Teachers can support all pupils to experience success; we can influence pupils’ resilience and their beliefs about their own ability. This can be done by seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers, and by working with families and colleagues to better understand pupils' individual circumstances. How we as teachers work with other people is a really important part of our roles.

This Block will help you develop your work with other professionals to achieve the best outcomes for children. It will look at how a culture of mutual trust and respect supports you to build effective relationships with parents, carers and families and help you to understand how these relationships can be used to improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.

Schools are unique communities that offer a wide range of opportunities for pupils and staff. You may be starting to feel an integrated member of the school community, with your own networks of colleagues and classes who you have come to know well. Now is a good time to think about how you can contribute further and benefit from taking part in more aspects of school life. It is also the perfect time to reflect on how you might further develop strategies next year to manage your workload and wellbeing and think about who else you might want to build relationships with to support this goal.

This Block builds on everything you have learned so far about effective classroom practice, subject knowledge, assessment and feedback, curriculum planning and adaptive teaching. Throughout this year you have been seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, as an essential part of teaching. Have you done this effectively? What impact has it had? Have you used the knowledge of other people involved in each pupil’s learning, including parents?

Now is a time to look back at your first year and reflect on the interactions you have had, and the relationships you have built with pupils, with families and with other professionals, such as your SENCO and Teaching Assistants. How have these interactions helped pupils’ learning? This might have been through supporting you to improve your pedagogical and subject knowledge, or through adapting your teaching to pupils’ individual needs. It is also a good opportunity to look forward to how you will continue to build these relationships to support your practice and improve pupil learning.

You will be supported to develop your knowledge and understanding of these key areas through the self-directed study material you find here on the portal. You will also have opportunities to discuss key ideas and deepen your understanding with colleagues and peers. Finally, you will work with your mentor to integrate your learning from theory into practice.

| 8h Communicating with parents and carers proactively and making effective use ofparents’ evenings to engage parents and carers in their children’s schooling |

You will be aware by now that teaching really is a “people profession”. Building relationships with other people, including pupils, colleagues, parents, carers and other specialist professionals, is key to the job. Relationships matter and we can build and nurture these proactively.

As we saw in Block 1, teaching has an important social element, which involves relating to and interacting with pupils. Positive relationships between teachers and pupils are associated with better educational outcomes (Allen et al., 2011; Wubbels et al., 2014; PISA, 2015; Valdebenito et al., 2018).

There are of course other adults involved in a pupil’s education. You will know this is particularly true for pupils with special educational needs who may interact with multiple different adults on a daily basis. Developing effective relationships with colleagues helps teachers to improve their practice and contribute to the school community, whilst relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success. These relationships are most effective when built on a culture of mutual trust and respect. We will explore this further later in the Block.

In this activity, we focus on working with the other adults who have relationships with the pupils you teach. These include parents, carers and families, and teaching assistants, pastoral leaders and other professionals. There is a specific section on working with your SENCO later in this Block.

## Effective relationships with parents, carers and families

Parents, carers and families have a significant influence on pupils’ education. As Hattie states, “parents can have a major effect in terms of the encouragement and expectations that they transmit to their children.” (Hattie, 2009). You can play a direct role in this through actively seeking to engage the parents, carers and families of individual pupils.

By this point, you may have already seen the impact of building positive relationships with parents and carers. Together, you can mutually improve pupil motivation, behaviour and academic success.

Your school will have its own communications policy and agreed ways for communicating with parents and carers. As a teacher, you should seek ways to reach out to families proactively. A useful way to establish these relationships is by engaging with parents, carers and families to support their children’s learning. Some ideas for doing this are exemplified in the following video.

## Video

Teacher 2: “Each term, I send a letter home outlining what we will be learning and how parents and carers can support this at home.”

Teacher 3: “At the start of a new topic, I put a card into each pupils’ book with questions that parents and carers could ask their children about the topic, and relevant websites/TV programmes that they could look at together.”

Teacher 4: “I take photographs of pupils’ work when it is excellent and email it to their parents or carers.”

Teacher 5: “I try to keep my language simple without too much subject-specific vocabulary.”

Teacher 6: “Each week I send a positive postcard home for three pupils who have really gone above and beyond what was expected of them.”

Proactively seeking to highlight pupil successes to parents and carers is another great way of engaging families in their child’s learning and helps establish and build relationships. By contacting parents and carers with positive feedback, even on a minor level, you will have set the tone for your relationship and it will make it far easier if you ever need to contact home with any negative feedback.

| Make sure parents/carers feel that you listen to them | - Listen and respond to parents/carers concerns: - “I agree that…” - “The reasons for this are…” - “I see that you feel…”                                                                                                                             |

You will likely have been involved in parent-teacher interviews or parents’ evenings. These are one way of communicating with parents/carers and can be effective in engaging them in their children’s schooling. Teachers who use these events effectively prepare in advance and think hard about the information they will share. They also use the opportunity to communicate their belief in the academic potential of each child. Being positive about the successes experienced, as well as focusing on improvement and next steps, is an important factor in doing this.

Watch the following video and consider the way in which the two teachers approach and prepare for parents’ evening.

  <li class="li1">How do you prepare for parent’s evening?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">
  <b>Year 6:</b> I make a pile for each student which includes a sample of their
  work to show parents. I have a template where I jot down some notes for each
  pupil in advance of the meetings – what’s going well, areas for improvement
  and some next steps for their child and how the parents can help. I do this so
  I don’t forget anything and I feel confident that I’m making the most of the
  time when I have parents and carers in front of me.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <b>Secondary:</b> It depends on the year group to be honest. If it is a KS3
  year group, I sometimes teach over 100 pupils in the year so I always print
  out a page with pupil names and pictures so I can refer to it if I need to. I
  would hate to make a mistake and so it is a discrete way to make sure I give
  the right information to the right parents. I always prepare a data sheet
  which has their latest test scores, homework and attendance records on it –
  and for GCSE classes I will include targets. I usually bring the class set of
  books with me as well, it’s helpful to be able to show examples of work to
  parents so they understand what I am talking about.
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">
    How do you manage the conversation to make best use of their time?
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">
  <b>Year 6:</b> I start by explaining what I am going to cover in the
  conversation and if that sounds good to them or is there is something they
  particularly want to talk about which I haven’t mentioned. This helps because
  sometimes parents have a really specific question which they ask right at the
  end of the slot and we then don’t have time to answer it which is frustrating
  for the parent as they came with that question in mind and then leave without
  having it answered. I try to not speak for the full slot to make sure that
  their questions have time to be answered.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <b>Secondary: </b>I always start by saying that the slot is just 10 minutes
  and that we will have to stick to time to be fair to the other parents. If at
  the end of the slot there feels like there is still a lot to talk about, I
  will suggest that I follow up the next day to arrange a longer meeting or
  phone call. However, this is rare because if I did have a concern about a
  pupil I would never surprise parents with this at parents evening – I would
  have already spoken to them and so when we meet at parents evening I am
  picking up the thread of a conversation and updating rather than informing for
  the first time.
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li1">
    What are your top tips for parents evening and dealing with difficult
    conversations?
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">
  <b>Year 6:</b> My top tip is to prepare as much as possible. Better to be over
  prepared than under. These are their children and so it shows respect to the
  parents that you have taken the time to plan. Always start by saying something
  positive about the pupil – not a generic comment like they are really well
  behaved – but something which shows that you know them as an individual like
  “I am consistently impressed by how patient your son/daughter is – just the
  other day we had to wait for the PE bus to arrive and they didn’t get
  frustrated but calmly took their book out to read!”.
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <b>Secondary: </b>My top tip is to remain polite and professional throughout.
  Start by smiling and shake their hand, if this is culturally appropriate. Say
  that you are pleased to finally meet them and share something positive which
  you have noticed about their child. If you are really worried about a
  particular conversation, ask another colleague to sit in with you and suggest
  that you meet in a side classroom for some privacy. Always follow up the next
  day if there was a question or query which you couldn’t answer.

Teachers’ relationships with parents, carers and families operate in two directions. As well as giving them information, you should remember that you can gain vital information from parents and carers, which can help you to better understand each pupil’s individual circumstances and how they can be supported. Parents and carers will also be able to share with you their children’s prior successes and failures, which influence their investment in their learning. After all, they know their children best (Department for Education, 2018).

Investment in education is influenced by prior successes and failures. When you are teaching a new class, you might have very little idea about each pupil’s background. Their behaviour and attitude to learning will be influenced by their prior successes and failures and understanding this can support your practice. You can gain useful insights through talking to parents and carers. This understanding can then be used to adapt your relationship and teaching of individual pupils.

The knowledge you gain will help you to:

- Understand pupils’ barriers to learning
- Identify effective strategies
- Adapt your teaching to individual pupils’ needs
- Influence pupils’ beliefs about their ability to succeed.

Teachers need to seek opportunities to engage parents, carers and families in the education of their children. You should not expect these relationships to just happen naturally or take them for granted. To be successful, they need to be built, developed and maintained. You can use small, deliberate actions to build these relationships so that they are positive and productive.

<p class="p1">
  When I start with my new class I know that building a relationship with the
  parents and carers is really important.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  Being a primary school, lots of our parents still drop their kids off or
  collect them at the end of the day so I make a point of standing outside to
  say hello and make the initial connection. I keep a list of pupils in my
  pocket so I tick off when I have met each parent or carer, and any that I
  haven’t met within the first few weeks I will give a quick call to say hello
  and introduce myself. I think it is important that families feel they can
  speak to me if they need to – some of our parents are difficult to engage and
  so a friendly first impression helps a lot.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  We have a policy of emailing home schemes of work and information about what
  we will be learning each half term. I find this is a really great way to
  communicate with families and I always include suggestions of activities which
  they can do with their children – simple stuff in the home or local area but
  also ideas of websites or books which would support the theme or topic we are
  doing.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  Our school parent afternoons tend to be quite early in the year – this is so
  we have a chance to sit down formally with each family and speak properly with
  them about their child. Almost every parent or carer I have ever met is
  delighted to talk about their child and how they can help them with their
  learning. I like to host these in my classroom so they can see where their
  child is all day, examples of their work on display and it is a quiet space so
  they can raise any worries or concerns. I always follow up with a quick email
  to say thank-you and it was nice to meet you. It’s a simple thing but it shows
  that I am open to continuing the dialogue and we are working together to
  support their child.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  I do sometimes use text messages – parents sign up to this at the start of the
  year to say they are happy to receive information this way. I tend to use
  texts for reminders or quick praise messages as they are short and easy to
  send. Parents seem to like it.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  One other thing I do to get to know parents and carers is ask the pupils. I do
  a ‘getting to know you’ activity when I first meet my class - they tell the
  class about who they live with and maybe some things like how they travel to
  school or who picks them up after school. This is always fun and I like being
  able to ask parents about their e-scooters or how their elderly relative who
  lives with them is doing.

Keep in mind that high quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils' life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The work you do building relationships and learning about a pupil’s individual circumstances will positively influence your practice as you will be able to effectively plan and adapt your teaching to suit the individual needs of your pupils.

## **Working with teaching assistants**

Teaching assistants (TAs) are a valuable resource in schools. When deployed and trained effectively, TAs can have a positive impact on pupil attainment and engagement, as well as reducing classroom disruption and allowing teachers more time to teach (Blatchford et al., 2009; Education Endowment Foundation, 2015). TAs can also provide benefits to pupils with special educational needs when they are appropriately supported to do so (Carroll et al., 2017).

A TA’s role is different to that of the teacher. You should work together respectfully but remember that as the teacher, you should take the lead. For a TA to be most effective, they should work as part of a team with the teacher, so that they supplement the teacher’s work rather than replace it. It is your role to prepare and brief the TA about individual lessons. TAs are often able to spend more time than teachers getting to know the pupils they work with, so they have knowledge that can be used in planning (Carroll et al., 2017).

Support staff may work more closely with SEND learners and in particular those who have an EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan). There is sometimes a risk that students can become over reliant on the support they receive from a TA. You should work with TAs to create strategies and provide opportunities for pupils to work as independently as possible, which can have a positive impact on longer term outcomes.

There can be a temptation to allow TAs to support pupils with more complex additional needs while your focus remains on the rest of the class group. Students with SEND benefit greatly from high quality input and the expertise of teachers and we must ensure that pupils with additional needs receive a healthy diet of time and input from the teacher and TA in their classroom.

Teacher quality matters most for the most vulnerable pupils. Teachers who are more effective overall tend to be even more effective at improving outcomes for pupils with low prior attainment, from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with behavioural difficulties.

<h2>Try this</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Over the course of the week keep a log as to how much time you as teacher and
  your TA spend with SEND learners. Reflect on the balance of time you spend
  with different students/groups and ensure all students benefit from the adult
  support and expertise within your classroom.

We will look in more detail later at specific activities you can practise in your work with your TA and other specialist colleagues. For now, here are some initial suggestions for you to consider planning for.

It would be useful to have planning meetings about whole units so that the TA has time to look ahead and read up on the topic. You could provide them with some source materials or places where they could do this. This should not increase your workload. Try inviting the TA to pre-existing planning meetings or give your prepared plan to your TA so that they can read it in their own time and come back to you with any questions. |
| Focus the TA on whole-class learning outcomes                                                                                                                 | Make sure the TA is aware of the learning outcomes of the lesson and give them specific tasks related to this. This could include them working with specific pupils in relation to the learning outcomes or circulating and supporting the whole class with reaching the learning outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| The TA could support pupils with special educational needs                                                                                                    | Set up regular meetings with support staff to discuss personalised plans and strategies for pupils with special educational needs. Make sure the TA has relevant understanding of the pupil’s strengths and weaknesses and time to prepare for the lesson. As the TA is usually able to get to know the individual pupil, they can use this knowledge to inform their planning.                                                                                                                                           |
| Ask the TA for input on designing learning activities, behaviour support plans and ensuring that the environment best meets the needs of an individual pupil. | Support staff will regularly see things in the classroom from a different perspective so ask for their input to support your planning to ensure an inclusive, positive classroom for all. Ensure that your TA is included in and plays a key role in any meetings about individual pupils they support, such as Annual Reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## **Working with other professionals**

Many other professionals work in schools. Developing effective working relationships with these colleagues is a way you can make a positive contribution to the wider life of the school, helping to create a sense that as a community of professionals you are working together to improve the lives of all pupils. Working with other staff in school can also lead to positive effects on teachers’ job satisfaction and decreases in stress and workload (Blatchford, et al., 2009). Support staff and other specialist colleagues have valuable expertise, which you can draw on and learn from to help you improve your teaching, whether this is working with particular pupils or developing your teaching.

| 8.3 Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues |

## **Effective professional relationships between all** adults working in a school underpin school communities.

These relationships:

- Help colleagues to build understanding of pupils’ individual circumstances
- Enable colleagues to support all pupils within the school
- Support each other’s professional development
- Contribute to pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.

Effective relationships are built on a **culture of mutual trust and respect**. Some of the communication skills we can use to achieve these include:

- Thinking before speaking
- Active listening such as nodding or smiling
- Being respectful of different opinions and perspectives
- Body language such as facing the person you are speaking to
- Controlled facial expressions
- Giving clear information or instructions
- Making compromises and showing flexibility
- Asking for time before responding to difficult feedback
- Saying please and thank you when receiving help or advice
- Dedicating sufficient time to conversations.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stay positive            | - Remain upbeat and positive when interacting with colleagues. - When dealing with difficult conversations, try to focus on the resolution. - Try not to get drawn in to negative conversations, instead focus on the positives.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Ask for help and support | - Seek advice whenever you need it. - Talk to colleagues from every part of the school and seek help/advice from them in their area of expertise. - Be open to learning from others. - If you are struggling with a pupil, consider the different people who can support you and seek them out. - Actively ask other teachers if you can informally observe their lessons and vice versa. |
| Offer help and support   | - Talk to different colleagues from all over the school. Keep building connections. - If a colleague is struggling, offer support. This could be academic, emotional or practical support. - Offer to observe a lesson and provide feedback.                                                                                                                                              |

High quality teaching is a key component to improving life chances for all children. Within each classroom, all pupils will require different levels and types of support to succeed. However, some pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support.

The Department for Education’s [SEND Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25) states that:

_All pupils should have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. \[…] Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil, whatever their prior attainment. Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. Potential areas of difficulty should be identified and addressed at the outset. Lessons should be planned to address potential areas of difficulty and to remove barriers to pupil achievement. In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum._

Types of need are categorised as:

- **Specific learning difficulties** which refer to a specific aspect of learning, e.g. a difficulty with numbers (dyscalculia) or literacy (dyslexia).
- **General learning difficulties** refer to a child who finds it difficult to learn, understand and do things compared to other children of the same age. General learning difficulties can be moderate, severe or profound.

Most pupils with severe or profound learning difficulties will receive support through an Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP). These outline the individual needs of the pupil and the provision in place to support them. It is important that you familiarise yourself with the EHCP, and any equivalent plans your school has in place, for the pupils you teach.

Pupils identified as having moderate or specific learning difficulties may not have an EHCP and it will be up to you to implement support for them. Many students in your class and school may be identified as SEN support and will likely require a very personalised approach to best meet their needs. Close collaboration and positive relationships with colleagues - especially the SENCO and TAs - families and pupils support us to identify and address potential barriers.

The SEND Code of Practice (2015) highlights the vital role that parents play in supporting children and young people with SEND. Parents can help you understand the needs of individual learners and ensure you provide the appropriate support for them.

Parents are the best placed individuals to provide details on:

- The health and early development of their child
- The support they have received outside the school system
- Whether any difficulties have been noted at home or elsewhere.

Consider how you communicate with parents and carers of SEND pupils and capture their views. Have you thought specifically about whether the information you share with families is accessible and whether they feel comfortable and confident to respond and communicate with you?

Some parents of SEND pupils may have faced negative experiences in communications with their child’s school previously. Some may themselves have additional needs. This might result in them finding it difficult to engage with teachers and school leaders and will require a personalised approach. For example, a parent may find meeting in a classroom or office intimidating. Instead, you could arrange to conduct a meeting in a soft-seating area in the school or build up to face to face meetings in the school after you have built a strong relationship through phone calls and email.

The four broad areas of need and support are:

- Communication and interaction
- Cognition and learning
- Social, emotional and mental health difficulties
- Sensory and/or physical needs.

Examples of the different types of need and potential classroom strategies are listed below. You will need to liaise with your school SENCO or other specialist colleagues to identify how best to use these types of strategies with individual pupils:

| Type of need                                                                                                                                                                                           | Classroom strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Communication and interaction**- Pupils with speech language and communication needs (SLCN) - Pupils with communication and interaction difficulties - Pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) | - Use visual supports around the classroom to support communication. These could be pictures/symbols/ Makaton signs or a combination of them all. - Give clear directions/instructions using key words. Avoid lengthy descriptions which make it challenging for pupils with SLCN to access key messages. - Consider your classroom environment and seating arrangements. Many pupils with SLCN will benefit from having a clear line of sight and close proximity to the teacher. - Make sure you give pupils the appropriate time to process a question or instruction (this will be different for all pupils). Teachers often fail to provide enough processing time. - Graphic organisers can support pupils to become more independent by presenting information through a combination of images and key words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Cognition and learning**- Pupils who have difficulties with attention, memory, problem solving, reasoning, transfer of learning, language or literacy                                                | - Explicit teaching of reading. Teach pupils the different aspects of reading and explicitly teach the link between reading, spelling and writing. - Use of visual support / key words and cues to help students to be more independent in their learning, e.g. a wall display to show you to layout writing. - Focussed clear objectives. - Model your thought process to show your cognitive process. - Learning through talk and discussion with peers and adults. Teachers explaining and commentating on activities can be an effective strategy. - Scaffolding ‒ break down the work for the pupil into small achievable steps. (See Block 3 for more information on this.) - Graphic organisers. Use graphical organisers such as cognitive maps or story frames to teach story structure and help reading comprehension. - Creating “sticky knowledge” books can support students in making links in their learning and develop their ability to transfer and generalise learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Behavioural, emotional and social development**- Pupils who have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD) - Pupils with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)                 | - Develop routines and use positively reinforcing language around behaviour. See Block 1 for more information on this. - Work with pupils and families to identify key motivators and design high interest activities that you know will be engaging. - Create a personalised positive behaviour support and engagement plan to share with all teachers and support staff. - Collect data for a pupil and identify the times they are highly engaged and also when they find it difficult to regulate. What do you notice? Are there patterns around times of day/certain activities that a pupil finds difficult? Can you adapt the environment to better meet their needs? - Peer-monitoring. Pupils are given a “buddy” to support them with behaviour, reminding them when they deviate from the targeted behaviour. - Self-monitoring. This asks the pupil to recognise a targeted behaviour and then take positive steps to alter the behaviour, e.g. a pupil has a vibrating pager which goes off periodically and reminds them to self-check. - Positive reinforcement. Appropriate behaviour is immediately recognised and rewarded (see Block 1 for more detail). - Headphones. In an individual task a pupil is given headphones which play white noise so that they can effectively block out distractions. - Pupil logs. Provide pupils with a log to identify and write down preparation/behaviour difficulties. Reflect and review together. - Prompts. Provide pupil with prompts they can refer to or tick off, e.g. Did I get my pen out? Did I remember by reading book? Did I write my homework down? |
| **Sensory and/or physical**- Pupils with visual impairments (VI) - Pupils with hearing impairments (HI) - Pupils with multi-sensory impairments (MSI) - Pupils who are physical disabled (PD)          | - Talk with your pupils and their families to discover their sensory preferences and how they respond to different stimuli. - Create multi-sensory areas in your classroom and a portable sensory suitcase that can follow a student around school. - Adapt the environment to increase access to and participation in learning. You might need to adapt seating plans, desk layout and organisation so that specific needs are met. - Explore and research different technology that can support sensory learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It is imperative that you know, understand and are able to action the safeguarding policy your school holds. You should:

- Familiarise yourself with the safeguarding policy
- Identify the designated safeguarding lead
- Familiarise yourself with actions to take if you need to enact safeguarding procedure.

As we have seen, many people in the school community can help you understand barriers and identify effective strategies for teaching pupils with SEND. In particular, the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO), has a vital role in leading schools’ approaches to supporting these pupils. As a teacher, you need to be proactive in establishing a working relationship with the SENCO.

$Content

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I am a SENCO of a mainstream primary school with 250 children on roll from
  nursery through to Year 6. I am a class teacher for three days a week and have
  two days a week non-contact time to concentrate on my SENCO leadership and
  management role. There are 62 children on the SEN Register, and many more who
  we are monitoring closely. We follow government and local authority guidance,
  using documents like the SEND Code of Practice to plan our approaches to
  supporting pupils. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  My role is to lead on developing our policies and make sure that teachers are
  supported effectively to follow them. People think that my role is largely to
  do with paperwork: submitting referrals to outside agencies such as Speech and
  Language Therapists, Education Psychology, Autism Outreach, and completing
  applications for Education Health Care Plans, and it is true: this takes up a
  great deal of time. However, I am also here to monitor the quality of
  classroom provision for all children with SEND and advise teachers on how to
  make classrooms, and teaching and learning, more inclusive. I can signpost
  staff to other specialist help on specific needs, e.g. dyslexia and dyspraxia,
  and can also link teachers into CPD activities to support them to develop. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  One of the things that is part of my role is to team teach or observe in class
  to look at a specific child or group of children and work with the teacher to
  develop provision for them. This can be helpful if children don’t have a
  diagnosis or any extra hours allocated to them as it is something the teacher
  can do themselves.

| You have been given a class list and there are three students who have special educational needs | - Talk to the previous teacher and ask them to share any key insights or strategies that were successful. - Contact the SENCO for support and advice. - Search for the “SEND Gateway” which will have resources, advice and research that will support your practice. - Adapt teaching to support individual pupils. For example, if you had a pupil who was dyslexic, you might use cloze exercises in which you give the pupil a worksheet with key information you will be covering in the lesson with words blanked out. The pupil would then be able to use that to take notes. - Make any necessary adjustments to seating plans. For example, a pupil with a slight visual impairment would need to be moved to sit near the front of the room to be able to see the board clearly. - When talking to parents/carers, show awareness and understanding. Ask for any insights or strategies that have been previously successful. - Set up an ongoing dialogue with parents/carers so that you can discuss any issues that arise. - Work with the TA to adapt your approach for each pupil. |
| A pupil you teach who has special educational needs is clearly struggling                        | - Contact home and ask for support. - Contact the SENCO for support and advice. - Reach out to other colleagues who might be able to help you, such as the pastoral lead who may be able to offer insights into other things that might be going on. - Reflect on any changes that might be impacting on the student. Gather information and data around the challenges the student is facing and how/when these are presenting. This information will support you in making the necessary adaptations and changes to support the student. - Talk to the pupil and ask them to share any issues or concerns. - If necessary, set up a meeting with all stakeholders to make an action plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| You think a pupil might have a special educational need but they have not been flagged to you    | - Contact the SENCO. There is a chance the pupil is already on their radar. - Ask the SENCO for strategies that you could try putting into place for the pupil to support their learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| ### **Building** trusting** relationships**Getting insights and feedback from a range of professionals in your school can be really beneficial to your development. Draw on their expertise by asking the TA to give you feedback about specific aspects of your teaching, such as:- Which pupils did I spend most time with this lesson? Were there any pupils I should have spent more time with? - Did I ask a range of different question types? - Was I consistent in my approaches across different pupils and/or different lessons? - Can you suggest any colleagues who I could observe in relation to one or more areas of development?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ### **Equal time** allocationsTAs should supplement, not replace, support from teachers. Try this activity to review how much time you spend with pupils compared to the time they spend with the TA:- Look at a series of lessons (a week or half term). - Plan your own role within each lesson and which groups of pupils both you and the TA(s) or other adults will work with. - Estimate what proportion of your time is spent with each group and what proportion of the TA(s) or other adults’ time. - If each pupil is not gaining an equal share of your time, adjust your planning to change this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ### **Sharing** planningThe TA will support pupils more effectively when you prepare for lessons with them. Try this series of planning steps to help with this:- Ensure the TA or the other adults you work with in lessons have copies of your lesson plans. - Arrange a time to discuss your plans. Make this a regular meeting and keep the time short: having a consistent approach will keep the meetings focused. - In advance of each meeting, make a list of key points and questions to discuss with them, including how this lesson fits into the sequence of learning, the intended outcomes of the lesson, the ways in which you will work together and your expectations of their role. - Together, agree the specific intentions for the pupils they will be working with, and how you will evaluate the outcomes of the lesson for these pupils. - Respond to any questions they have, especially in relation to the subject knowledge of the lesson, and check that you are both clear on your roles and how you will work together in the lesson. - Seek support from your mentor if there are logistical factors that make shared planning difficult. |
| ### **Pupils’** investment** in learning**The TA and other adults often build long-term relationships with pupils and therefore understand their prior experiences of success and failure. Identify a pupil or group of pupils who the TA knows well and ask them:- What prior successes has the pupil experienced? - What prior failures? - What have you learned about the pupil’s learning based on this? - What conversations could we have with pupils to help them articulate their long-term goals? - How could we use this information in our lessons to help the pupil to experience greater success in their learning?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ### Supplementing** teacher support**The TA and other adults should be given constructive, concrete roles in pupils’ learning. Their role should not be just “manage Josie’s behaviour” or “sit with Sun-Yee”. Instead, plan their role to be one or more of:- Working with pupils as a “talk partner” to discuss thinking and answers - Providing appropriate scaffolding using the “least first” principle (see Mentor Handout 6.5b) - Supporting pupils to help them make improvements to work based on your feedback - Challenging the learning of pupils who are achieving well by asking them to explain their answers to questions - Recording evidence of pupils’ responses to aid assessment - Following up learning from last session with specific targeted questions, which you write together - Working as part of a “double act” with you to address misconceptions or worked examples, such as the TA asking you further questions to help you model how to find the answer to a problem, working from a script you have devised together before the lesson.                                                                                              |
| ### **Using** information** from assessment**The TA and other adults will gain vital information about pupils’ learning. Find out about this by:- Arranging a time soon after each lesson/day for brief, informal feedback about pupil learning. Together use this time to identify achievement in relation to intended learning and appropriate next steps. - Arranging a regular time once every half term for a longer feedback and review session. Use this to jointly agree targets for pupils for the next period. - Jointly, use your assessments to identify gaps and misconceptions in learning and plan activities that will support these pupils to overcome their misconceptions and fill gaps in their learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Welcome back! When you started on this programme, you began by looking at how
  to establish a positive learning environment. You learned about how to make
  your classroom a secure, safe and predictable place for your pupils through
  setting up and developing classroom routines, communication of your high
  expectations and building positive relationships. You’ve had a whole year to
  practise these and you will have had many successes. No doubt, there are still
  times when managing behaviour and keeping your expectations really high is
  challenging. That is why we are revisiting it now at the beginning of Year 2,
  just as you will be doing the same with your pupils.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In this Block, we build on your knowledge by looking at what motivates pupils.
  Understanding ‘what makes them tick’ will help you to develop an even more
  purposeful learning environment. You will explore the different ways you can
  motivate pupils, from using rewards to helping your pupils develop more
  personal motivation. You have already explored the importance of upholding
  high expectations and you will see this is also a key factor in motivation;
  you will explore the link between maintaining high expectations and your
  pupils feeling motivated to work hard and apply effort. You will also consider
  how enabling your pupils to achieve meaningful success can motivate them to
  put in the effort needed for further success.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  We will look further at the importance and value of the language you use with
  pupils, highlighting the ways we can use language to establish an effective
  learning environment and support pupils, empowering them to take ownership of
  their own learning. In Block 1 you explored how you could demonstrate your
  high expectations to your pupils and the impact this would have on pupil
  outcomes. In this Block you will consider how you can use praise meaningfully
  to support and motivate your pupils.

An effective learning environment both allows and expects pupils to achieve and to struggle: this is part of the learning process. With this in mind, it is important to plan appropriate challenge for your pupils and support them to achieve. As we established earlier, succeeding in difficult tasks is motivating for your pupils and is likely to drive further success. We want to harness this and use it to drive learning forwards. You can support pupils to achieve through the learning activities you set, how you structure these and how you put them into practice.

The following strategies will support your pupils to achieve success in the challenging tasks you set. When planning for this, you should set an activity which will support your pupils to achieve an existing learning goal. This should stretch them: they should be required to apply effort and to think hard. It will be necessary to explain this explicitly to your pupils to ensure that they persevere.

As you start planning, ask yourself:

1. What are the main learning goals for this group over the next period?
2. What challenging knowledge, concept or skill will enable them to move closer to this goal?
3. Which of the following strategies would best support them to master this concept?

### If this is happening in your classroom, you will see…

- Pupils have resources to support them in tasks
- Pupils understand the instructions they are given
- Pupils achieving success in tasks which may otherwise have been too challenging

### Practise…

#### Instructional strategies

Novices benefit from explicit instruction. You could:

- Use direct instruction to teach basic knowledge and concepts rather than ‘discovery learning’ or ‘problem solving approaches’.
- Use modelling and worked examples, including ‘thinking out loud’ (explaining your reasoning/thinking behind what you are doing).
- Break up lengthier tasks into smaller steps, making them more achievable.

For example

- ‘Today we are going to be learning about the Cold War. I am going to start by giving you some key facts.’
- ‘So I can now see that before I can work out the value of X, I am going to have to go back to the beginning of my equation.’

#### Using resources

We need to consider the resources we use within lessons and how these can contribute positively towards supporting pupils.

- Use concrete resources (e.g. artefacts, apparatus) that aid understanding of abstract concepts.
- Adapt task resources to scaffold thinking (e.g. using a worksheet to provide structure to a talk, providing word banks, using visual prompts, providing sentence stems, knowledge organisers etc).
- Use resources (including technology) to enable pupils to access written tasks (e.g. mini-whiteboards, recording devices etc).

For example

- ‘In front of you, you can see the spinning top. We are going to use this to explore angular momentum and gyroscopic motion.’
- ‘Today you are going to write your description of the haunted house. You have a word bank and sentence starters to help you.’
- ‘I am going to write three key words on your mini-whiteboard, George. I want you to cross off each one as you use it in your paragraph.’

#### Managing cognitive load

When our pupils try to make sense of new information, we can reduce the chances of overloading their working memory.

- Provide resources to scaffold and structure learning (see above).
- Ensure you give specific and manageable task-related instructions (refer to Block 1).
- Being mindful of how we present information so that it is as clear as possible.
- Break down complex information or activities into smaller chunks.
- Use visual cues alongside auditory to support understanding.

For example

- ‘We are going to begin by planning our stories using the building blocks shown on your worksheet.’
- ‘Firstly, I need you to open your books to page 20. We are going to read the next chapter thinking about how the author presents the character Mr Birling.’
- ‘Similes use the words like or as. Similes are about comparison and focus on similarities. We can describe something unfamiliar by comparing it to something familiar.’
- ‘We are all going to begin by writing our opening sentence using an adjective and an adverb.’

## Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors

Why are you reading this today? Maybe your mentor has been reminding you for the last week or so, and you felt you couldn’t put it off any longer. It’s hard to get started with a new piece of learning and you needed a push from someone to get going. Or maybe you’re feeling pretty excited about it. You’ve been seeing the improvement in your practice over the last few months and really want to be the best teacher possible. Perhaps it’s a bit of both.

Either of these feelings are recognised and valid reasons for doing this work – motivation is often considered to be either:

### Intrinsic motivation

From internal sources, such as the pure enjoyment of task engagement.

### Extrinsic motivation

From external sources such as receiving financial compensation.

(Lazowski & Hullman, 2016)

## In the classroom this could look like:

### Intrinsic motivation

- Pupils reading for enjoyment
- Pupils wanting to try new things because they want to learn
- Revising work to improve it because they want to do better
- Seeing feedback as a learning opportunity

### Extrinsic motivation

- Reading because parents/carers/teachers have said you should
- Working hard to get a reward
- Focusing on the grade/score rather than the feedback on work
- Completing an activity/task to get a reward

As part of a highly effective learning environment, we must ensure that our pupils are motivated to learn: the evidence shows that motivated pupils learn more and have better outcomes (Lazowski & Hullman, 2016).

As teachers, we need to understand our pupils and plan activities which motivate them. We can’t assume that pupils are always motivated simply by a love of learning for its own sake (although this may be the case for some pupils). Like all of us, pupils are motivated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors and we must consider both of these when planning lessons and establishing a supportive learning environment.

Lots of the time, pupils you teach will be motivated by extrinsic rewards and these can be a useful tool when implemented carefully. If used in the wrong way, however, this type of motivation can become transactional with pupils only doing work or putting in effort when receiving a reward upon completion. Over time, this can give the message that it is ability (the ends) rather than effort (the means) that is important. When used prudently however, rewards can help create a positive learning environment and even encourage intrinsic motivation.

Willingham (2009) considers the use of rewards in the classroom, citing conflicting research that suggests rewards have the potential for either a positive or a negative effect in the classroom. A study that used incentives, including money, to motivate GCSE pupils found that although there was some improvement in effort in class, there was no evidence of any impact on behaviour, attendance or homework effort, nor was there any impact on attainment in Maths, English or Science (Sibieta, et al., 2014).

There is no right or wrong answer as to whether to use rewards, but rather it is how we use rewards in our classrooms that matters. Used well, rewards (an extrinsic motivation) can be used to develop some of the behaviours which may lead to intrinsic motivation such as perseverance, effort and seeking challenge:

| Teachers should:                                                              | The reason why                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Exemplification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Use rewards for a specific reason, such as encouraging appropriate behaviours | Rewards can be used effectively to encourage a desired behaviour, which might be seen as dull, but mastering the foundational concepts and knowledge will aid long-term success.                                | For example, teachers might reward consistently good behaviour, ‘You have really persevered with this task, I am going to give you a merit, well done.’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Use rewards in the moment and avoid giving them too regularly                 | If used for too long, it is more likely that use of a reward will actually have negative implications: rewards with novelty are more appealing. Pupils should not complete tasks expecting a reward at the end. | For example, if a teacher gives out a small reward each time their pupils put their hands up to answer a question, they will soon run out of rewards, and pupils will lose interest in them (or worse, see this as an enjoyable game). Instead, offer rewards infrequently and try to make them unexpected. This will help pupils view their work as something to complete for their own benefit rather than for a reward. ‘I am so impressed with the effort you have shown in this task, I am going to phone home and tell your parents how hard you have worked today.’ |
| Beware of rewarding pupils for tasks they (should) enjoy                      | For pupils who already enjoyed doing the task when the reward was offered, it may result in them enjoying the task less than they did at the start: the reward has the effect of de-motivating.                 | For example, if pupils are rewarded for the number of books they read, this may turn reading into a mechanical activity in order to achieve the reward rather than an enjoyable activity in its own right. Instead you might praise the pupil for trying a more challenging book. ‘I am going to give you a merit for your reading today, I know you chose a really challenging book.’                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Helping pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically

Although it is important to acknowledge that all pupils are individuals and will be motivated in different ways and for different reasons, as teachers, there are steps we can take to encourage and support pupils to develop an intrinsic love of learning and an understanding that effort and the process of learning are crucial for success. This will hold them in good stead in their life beyond school.

And developing a sense of personal, intrinsic motivation is a vital goal of a pupil’s education. We want pupils to see themselves as the type of people who work hard and can succeed, for the right reasons: motivation is ideally part of your personal identity and aligned to your values.

One of the main ways you can influence pupil motivation is through rewards. Rewards play to pupils’ extrinsic motivation, but they can also be used to ‘nudge’ them towards behaviours which – over time – are representative of more intrinsic motivation.

### Types of reward

- Verbal praise
- Thumbs-up
- Merits
- Postcards home
- Phone call home
- Stickers
- Public praise in assembly
- Certificates

### How to encourage intrinsic motivation

- Rewarding effort
- Rewarding learning strategies
- Rewarding learning processes
- Rewarding persistence
- Rewarding resilience
- Rewarding good behaviour
- Rewarding progress rather than attainment

Often, the policy for pupil rewards will be set at school rather than classroom level. While there may well be significant freedom for you as a teacher within this, what is rewarded and how will be closely linked to the culture and values of the school.

$Content
I believe that our students need to be given options, the opportunity to make decisions, and to feel that they have some control over the environment and their learning.

These are some of the things that I do in my school to build intrinsic motivation and encourage pupils to take a genuine interest in their own learning.

I try to create a positive environment to support pupil motivation. All tutors work with their tutor groups to set individual goals, these may be around self-regulation. Students are rewarded for achieving personal bests and effort towards achieving those goals. Rather than asking pupils to compare themselves to others, we teach self-assessment techniques and ask pupils to evaluate their own progress towards their goals.

We also try to convey a clear message about what the school truly values in our pupils. We use awards assemblies to show pupils that we value academic prowess, but we also reward and acknowledge effort and pupil improvement. Every half-term we have award certificates and gift vouchers for the ‘most improved’ pupil in each subject. We bring in motivational speakers to inspire our pupils and show them that if they put in effort, they will get the results.

We ask teachers to use positive language with all of their classes and to pitch their lessons to be challenging but inclusive. Teachers should plan for their most-able pupil and then provide scaffolding to support all of their pupils to achieve success. There are too many pupils being under-challenged when conversely, challenge that leads to success is motivating for pupils.

Whenever possible, we advocate offering pupils choices in their own learning. If pupils are able to have some autonomy over their learning, they are more likely to value it and put in more effort.

I like to openly discuss motivation with my pupils and talk about my own personal motivations. I actively show pupils that success is important but doesn’t always look the same. I try to show pupils that we are all on a personal learning journey and learning in itself can be rewarding.

## Pupils’ investment in learning is driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure

We’ve already seen that there is a strong link between motivation and student success, and so we know that _understanding_ and _developing_ pupil motivation is something we need to focus upon as teachers. Interestingly, it is more likely that **pupil success _leads to_ increased motivation**, rather than pupils being motivated to succeed in the first place.

The evidence shows that if your pupils can see the _value_ of the work they have been asked to do and _believe_ they can _succeed_ in it, the likelihood of them being intrinsically motivated will be much greater (EEF, 2013). Motivation to achieve has been shown to consist of:

- Students’ expectations of success (e.g. ‘I think I can do this ‒ we’ve done something similar before.’)
- Their perception of the overall value of the activity or task (e.g. ‘I can see how this topic is an important part of the subject, and I want to know more.’)
- How much they value the task at hand (e.g. ‘I can see that understanding this concept is key to succeeding in this topic.’).

Pupils are individuals and will perceive success in different ways. Success could take a number of forms such as grasping a tricky concept, reading aloud to the class or achieving a good mark in an assessment. What a pupil perceives as success is dependent on their prior experiences and it is important to be mindful of this. If a pupil achieves success in your lessons, and is able to experience and enjoy the feeling of succeeding, they are likely to be motivated to work hard and strive for further success. By offering opportunities for all pupils to achieve success we can motivate pupils to want to work hard and learn.

Of course, this is a two-way street. Prior experience of _failure_ is also influential on motivation. In your classroom, it is important to avoid things which will lead to pupils to perceive of themselves as ‘failing’.

## Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success.

So how do we steer pupils’ perceptions towards feeling successful? Ideally we want to set up a self-reinforcing cycle: if we hold consistently high expectations for our pupils and ensure that we are teaching them well then pupils can begin to experience success, which in turn can lead to greater motivation to succeed. This often means pushing pupils slightly beyond what they are comfortable with – having high expectations means that all pupils must be expected to participate in challenging tasks – and sometimes success may not be instant. We need to avoid this feeling like ‘failure’. To help maintain their motivation, you should teach pupils that:

- They are allowed to get things wrong
- Learning is difficult
- A struggle can be part of the process
- They shouldn’t give up when things are difficult at first
- Errors and mistakes are part of learning
- They can ask you for help
- They are allowed to ask questions of their learning.

This needs skilful management to ensure pupils can succeed; struggling too much might indicate that the tasks are pitched too high or need more scaffolding. When pupils understand that to make errors is part of the process of learning, they will be more willing to put effort in to challenging tasks and less likely to give up when they face difficulties. Learning requires thinking. As Coe states, ‘learning happens when people have to think hard’ (Coe et al., 2013). Thinking hard is – unsurprisingly – hard.

Pupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure. When pupils understand that they can improve through hard work and practice, rather than having set abilities that they cannot increase, it is likely that they will work harder (‘I will improve if I put in more effort.’). Teachers should support pupils to develop this belief in their own ability to succeed by helping them to identify what has helped them to learn and be successful previously. We explored how to use feedback to do this effectively in Block 5 and will return to this in Block 11.

A key technique for achieving this positive reinforcement of pupils’ beliefs in themselves is praise. While praise can be used to support and motivate pupils, but it is important to be mindful of the impact our praise can have.

- Praise should be sincere and honest
- Praise should emphasise process not ability
- Praise should be as immediate as possible.

| **When giving praise, try to avoid...**                                                        |
| Praising intelligence rather than effort:‘Well done, you are really clever at mathematics.’    |
| Praising the outcome:‘You got 83%, that is great.’                                             |
| Attributing success to ability: ‘I knew you would do well at that task, you always do.’        |
| Revealing grudges: ‘I can see you’re trying as hard in this lesson as you didn't last lesson.’ |
| Giving the impression that success comes easily: ‘Great answer, this is easy for you.’         |

When praise is used effectively it can tell students that they are on the right track and motivate them to continue working. Using praise judiciously and communicating genuine warmth and enthusiasm can have a direct impact on motivation and the learning environment.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Praise the effort.‘Well done, that was a difficult task and you worked really hard to get that result.’                                                                                                                    | We want pupils to see that the effort they put in can have an impact on the results they get. Be mindful that the pupil may take this to mean that they have done badly, consider the ways you might mitigate this.                                                        |
| Praise the process.‘You have worked really hard to find a solution to the problem, well done.’                                                                                                                             | Praising the process pupils have followed acknowledges the work pupils have put in. Even if the outcome is not quite what you or the pupil want, you might praise the thinking skills they have shown.                                                                     |
| Attribute success to effort and practice.‘The way you did that showed me how much you have been practising. You have really improved, well done.’                                                                          | Acknowledging and appreciating the work a pupil has put in conveys the importance of effort and shows that you value hard work and practice. It also demonstrates that results can be improved on through hard work.                                                       |
| Start every class afresh, making it clear that you are looking for every pupil to do well.‘Here’s the feedback from the last homework activity. The first thing we are doing to do is improve our work together.’          | Pupils’ may come to the lesson with fixed ideas about what you think of them and their abilities. Strive to demonstrate that you are looking for pupils to succeed and do well.                                                                                            |
| Teach that success usually follows multiple unsuccessful attempts.‘This is a very challenging task and I am not expecting perfect answers yet. What I do want to see is everyone trying their best and putting in effort.’ | Explicitly teaching that it is impossible to get a perfect result the first time you do something and mastering a skill takes practice and hard work will help your pupils see the value in trying hard and practicing.                                                    |
| Teach that errors lead to valuable feedback which can generate improvement.‘That is a good error, and lots of people have the same problem. Let’s all go over this now, so we know how to do it next time.’                | This shares the idea that making mistakes and errors are an important part of the learning process and one that we should value. Pupils’ may be afraid to try in case they fail so we want to create a learning environment in which making mistakes are part of learning. |
| Reinforce the idea that it is never too late to improve.‘We will come back to this next time.’                                                                                                                             | Show your pupils that they can always improve on something. This emphasises the importance of effort and hard work.                                                                                                                                                        |

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It’s one thing for pupils to recall the content they have just encountered
  during a lesson, and quite another for them to be able to recall and use it
  weeks or even months later.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This is important in all sorts of ways. As we have seen, knowledge and
  expertise accumulate, with new information linking to and reinforcing what we
  knew already. Poor recall may well indicate that this is not happening. While
  as an adult you may not remember everything that you were taught in school,
  much of it will be helping to support the knowledge you currently have and
  use. And not unimportantly for schools, pupils’ knowledge is tested at various
  points in their education to see what they have learned. If everything goes in
  one ear and out the other, neither the pupil nor the school will get the
  formal recognition of their successes, and all that this brings.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Block 2, you explored how pupils learn; how the working memory can become
  overloaded and how we as teachers can use our understanding of how children
  learn to design instruction and tasks which support pupils when learning new
  material. Hopefully, you have been using many of the techniques over the past
  year, such as introducing new material in small steps and providing worked
  examples, and have seen the benefit of these in helping pupils to learn
  better. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This Block builds directly on Block 2. We are now considering how we can make
  new learning ‘stick’ over time so that pupils remember what they have been
  taught. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This is relevant at all phases and in all subjects.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Early Years, you need pupils to be able to remember certain things, such as
  which hook to put their coats on to avoid chaos at pick-up time! They will
  also be developing some of the fundamental knowledge and know-how that they
  need for success at school and throughout their lives.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Primary and Secondary, as you plan to teach more complex ideas or concepts
  you will be building on previously taught material. Again, all new learning is
  based on prior knowledge. Pupils connect new ideas into existing schemata in
  their long-term memory. The better pupils remember something, the more easily
  they will be able to grasp new ideas. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The point about not remembering everything we encounter at school is of course
  important: there is always going to be an element of decay in our memories.
  This comes down to two main factors; storage strength{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  how well did you embed the learning in your long-term memory? And retrieval
  strength{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  how often you have accessed the memory over time? At some point, knowledge
  will fade if it is not useful to you or used by you.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Although there is a level of responsibility which lies with your pupils{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  Did they spend any time revising in advance of the test? Did they actively
  think about which hook to put their coat onto?{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  as the teacher you also have responsibility to plan how you will support
  pupils to retain information over time. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Education researchers have identified some effective ways teachers can help
  pupils to do this. For example:
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Making sure pupils encounter new material more than once and at spaced
      intervals
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Incorporating tasks which require pupils to actively retrieve information
      from their memory
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Providing opportunity to practise new material, ideally with feedback.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The added benefit of planning activities like these into your lessons{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and making the reason clear to pupils </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  is that it demonstrates which study approaches work best. As pupils get older,
  and do more independent study, they will be using techniques which are shown
  to be effective as opposed to less effective techniques such as highlighting
  text or passively re-reading pages of notes. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Remember, it is not just about the exam at the end of the year. You are
  setting pupils up for a lifetime of learning. In Early Years and Primary you
  are teaching pupils the foundational skills which they need to access all
  subjects and disciplines such as reading and writing. At Secondary level,
  perhaps pupils will choose to continue studying your subject at Key Stage
  Four, college or university and the knowledge you help them to retain now will
  form the basis of even more rewarding learning to come.{" "}

## Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.

If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around to hear it, did it happen?

If a pupil can do something in a lesson, with scaffolding and support from an adult or resources, but cannot remember it or do it themselves at a later point independently, have they really learned it?

This is one of the challenges you will face as a teacher. It is prudent and right to scaffold learning for pupils, particularly when they are dealing with new or complex material for the first time, but there comes a point where pupils will need to remember what you have taught them and apply their learning independently, for example in tests or in lessons the following year with a different teacher.

When learning has taken place, there is a lasting change. Imagine a toddler learning to walk. They don’t (or rarely) revert back to shuffling on their bum. A lasting change in their capabilities for how to move has taken place and they are able to then build on this new skill to learn more complex movements, such as running or skipping.

Now imagine your pupils. What can they do now that they couldn’t do before?

This might be something you have directly taught them, such as how to factorise an equation or write a compelling paragraph. It might be a social skill they have learned through interacting with others, such as waiting their turn or being polite when they encounter other people around the school.

Whatever the learning that has taken place, the common thing you will notice is that when they were first learning the skill or knowledge, they required support and prompts (“Wait until Sarah has taken her turn first.”), but once they have learned it they are able to do it independently (“Please go ahead, you were here first.”) and, importantly, it is learning that lasts. It represents a lasting change in their capabilities or understanding which extends beyond the initial teaching moment.

There are many things which you will want your pupils to learn and be able to remember. It might be a set of facts or knowledge which you know will be important for further study in a particular subject or topic, such as the parts of an atom. It might be a foundational skill, like reading, which you know underpins learning across all subject areas.

In Block 2 you learned about how pupils learn related to memory and cognition. In simple terms, we each have a working memory and a long-term memory. When we remember something, we are pulling the information from our long-term memory.

While our working memory is limited by both capacity and duration (Cowan, 2008), our long-term memory is a vast storehouse with no known capacity. This is good news for teachers ‒ pupils in theory _can_ learn all of the material you want them to remember. The biggest limitation is the working memory which can become overloaded and therefore stop processing new information and preventing it being transferred successfully to the long-term memory. Even if it does reach the long-term memory, unless it is actively used again it is likely to be forgotten.

Therefore, making use of evidence-informed approaches to support pupils to transfer new knowledge to their long-term memory _and to strengthen it when it gets there_ is a key aspect of teaching.

Until relatively recently, this field of expertise ‒ what some now call the science of learning ‒ was unknown to many educators. As Dunlosky et al. (2013) point out, psychologists have been developing and evaluating the efficacy of particular approaches to memory and learning for over 100 years. There is a vast array of evidence about which techniques are the most effective in helping people to learn which have been replicated to the point we can be very confident they are true. And yet many teachers (and therefore pupils) do not use them. Indeed, many of the techniques which are popular are ineffective, yet we continue to use them. Examples of popular but comparatively ineffective techniques include reading, highlighting and underlining text for revision, learning styles and the idea that motivation alone leads to learning (as we saw in Block 1, the relationship is, if anything, the other way round and success is likely to lead to higher levels of motivation).

## Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned.

When something has been learned, it has been transferred into the long-term memory and is stored in schemata and can therefore be recalled when needed. For example, when you first learned that new sentences start with a capital letter you added this new fact to your schema on ‘writing’, ‘reading’ and ‘grammar’. After you learned this new fact, your teacher probably got you to practise writing sentences. They almost certainly prompted you to retrieve this rule from your long-term memory when you made errors, through feedback or correction, and you understood why you were being asked to practise further. Since then you have regularly practised writing many sentences using capital letters. it is now second nature and seeing a sentence without a capital letter at the start jars! Through regular, purposeful practice you consolidated a piece of new learning.

Not all new material is something which you can (or should) practise as often as capital letters but if you want your pupils to really remember something which they have learned, they will need to practise it over time.
In contrast to the passive study techniques mentioned above, doing something active when reviewing previously taught material ‒ for example practice testing ‒ has been shown to help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned:

- Recall activities, e.g.

  - Using flashcards
  - Quizzes
  - Answering questions on previously learned materials

- Completing practice questions, e.g.

  - As homework
  - In class

- Practice tests, e.g.

  - Completing past papers
  - Multiple-choice tests.

As Adescope et al. (2017) highlight, ‘the testing effect is a well-known concept referring to gains in learning and retention that can occur when students take a practice test on studied material before taking a final test on the same material. Research demonstrates that students who take practice tests often outperform students in non-testing learning conditions such as restudying, practice, filler activities, or no presentation of the material.’

The quote above refers to tests before tests. It’s likely that if your pupils are preparing for an exam, you will have given them ‘mock’ practice tests for them to complete either as homework or in class so that they practise. This is nothing new. But it is not just in preparation for exams that pupils should practise. Anything which you want pupils to remember needs to be practised.

You should remember that ‘practice is an important aspect of learning, but not all practice is equal’ (Deans for Impact, 2015). There are a few considerations which you need to make when planning practice activities for pupils:

- Dosage ‒ how much practice should pupils do of the material?
- Timing ‒ when should they practise the material?
- Feedback ‒ how do pupils know they are practicing the right material?

In terms of dosage, the American professor of psychology John Dunlosky (2013) advises that the simplest answer is: the more the better. Multiple opportunities for pupils to practise material significantly improves recall, as demonstrated through a final test, compared to pupils who only practise once. One way schools address this is through their curriculum planning, giving pupils chances to encounter the same topics or themes iteratively at points throughout a course (a spiral curriculum), and perhaps across year groups. In your own planning, or in that of your department or Key Stage group, you may well see this approach being taken.

Have a look at the draft scheme of work below.

- How has the teacher mapped opportunities for pupils to be able to revisit previously learned material content over time?

Consider your scheme(s) of learning for this year:

- Are there opportunities for pupils to practise previously learned material again?

### Example

| 4    | Subtraction within 10 | Using models subtraction         | Solving word problems subtraction           | Decimals 1      | Decimals 2      |

| 6    | Length                | Multiplying by 4, 5 and 6        | Multiplication problems                     | ...             | ...             |

When planning for pupils to practise material multiple times, you do need to take into account the time between each practice. Several studies have found that practice in quick succession has minimal benefits, compared to sizable benefits which occur when practice is spaced over time (Dunlosky 2013). In this country, guidance from the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) states that, ‘\[l]earning everything to do with a topic during a single time period is not as effective as distributed learning’ (EEF, 2018).

As with dosage, where more is better, with spacing, longer is generally better. There are multiple studies which have shown the benefits of delaying reviews of material so pupils have almost forgotten it before they encounter it again (Pachler et al., 2007). While this might seem counterintuitive, spaced learning actually helps pupils with the process of cementing new material into their long-term memory. When it is massed together (think cramming before an exam), the knowledge may be retained for a short while, but is likely to be lost later. As knowledge becomes more secure, you can increase the challenge by extending the time between practice opportunities.

Pachler et al. (2007) recommend that you should ‘space learning over time. Arrange to review key elements of course content after a delay of several weeks to several months after initial presentation.’ To identify these key elements, think back to Block 4 and ask yourself:

- What key facts would it be helpful for my pupils to commit to their long-term memory so they can easily recall them and use them when learning more complex ideas?

It is recommended that pupils encounter new material on at least two separate occasions. In some cases, this will happen naturally as pupils progress through content (e.g., pupils will use full stops in almost every writing assignment after they are taught it). In other cases, you will need to explicitly plan when new material will be reviewed and practised.

  Spaced practice is when opportunities to review and practise the material are
  distributed over time. Instead of just seeing it once, pupils will be exposed
  to the content at spaced gaps.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In my class, I know that pupils are going to forget previously taught material
  if I don’t revisit it. When I introduce an important new idea or concept, I
  always plan when I will teach review lessons on it or re-introduce the
  material after a few days or weeks. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For example, for our half termly topics, after I teach pupils the key
  vocabulary I might review it every day for the first week using short recall
  quizzes to match the definitions up. Then, the following week I will only get
  pupils to explicitly practise it on three days, maybe getting pupils to
  practise using the vocabulary in writing or in a talk task. I will slowly
  extend the gap between practice activities on the vocabulary and pupils should
  start to use it in their writing without me prompting.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  We also do a weekly spelling test so I will include a few of the vocab words
  in that and rotate them out and back in again. I always include some spelling
  words from the last term’s topic as well so they don’t forget those while
  learning new ones!
</span>

What makes practice purposeful? We know from lots of fields that _quality_ of practice is just as important as _quantity_ of practice. If you want to learn to play tennis, you will get better simply by playing a couple of times a week. However, if you really want to improve you will need to identify the key skills of the game and your weaknesses as a player, break the skills down so you understand them and commit to regular, focused practice of the component parts, building the level of difficulty, until they are second nature. You might need to pay a coach to give you feedback and you probably won’t stick to this plan unless you have clear goals for improvement either.

The same applies to purposeful practice in education. When planning practice activities, you should think about:

- What do I want my pupils to be able to know or do well?

  - What are the stages between where they are now and this objective?

- How will this help pupils know what they do and don’t remember?

  - Does the activity include answers so pupils can check?

- How will pupils know what ‘good’ looks like?

  - Does the activity include a model or worked example for pupils to refer back to?
  - Will the pupil have access to their classwork or textbook so they can improve their answers?

- How will pupils identify gaps and where they need more practice?

  - Is there an opportunity to reflect and plan what they need to do next?

You will also need to think about how you ‒ as an expert ‒ can give them feedback. Practice with feedback is more effective than practice alone (Dunlosky, 2013). Not only does this help them improve over time, it also means that they will not practise incorrect material, and commit errors and misconceptions to their long-term memory (Rosenshine, 2012; Roedinger & Butler, 2011).

## Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall

$CTA

<h2>In your notepad</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Read the summary from the EEF (2018) on retrieval practice and answer the
  following questions.
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is retrieval practice?</span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Why do you think that retrieval practice is more effective than re-reading
      a text?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Can you think of any examples when you have used retrieval to support
      pupils learning?
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Repeatedly re-reading a text is not an effective way of learning. It is much
  more effective for pupils to try to retrieve what they already know about a
  topic,
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  or what they have recently read about it, from memory. Retrieval practice
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">involves retrieving something you have learned in the past and bringing it back to mind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You can use retrieval to review past learning before introducing new related
  learning. For example, you might ask pupils to recall group one of the
  periodic table before introducing group seven, showing its similarities and
  differences. 
</span>
<p style="text-align: right;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">EEF (2018)</span>
</p>
$CTA

Retrieval practice is effective because it requires ‘an effort from within’ to call information to mind, as opposed to just reading or hearing it (Roedinger & Butler, 2011). The evidence shows that because retrieval is an active behaviour, as opposed to passive, it stimulates our brains more and in the process helps to strengthen the existing memory. In other words, the more often you retrieve some information from your long-term memory the more likely it is to stay there.

Retrieval practice also helps us to identify gaps in our knowledge. Through the struggle of trying to recall a piece of information, we are cognisant of what we do not remember. Being aware of what you do and do not know is an important feature of metacognition, which we know is an important part of successful learning (See Block 3).

One way many pupils choose to study is by re-reading notes, listening to explanations on YouTube or watching video animations. While this shouldn’t be discouraged, retrieval practices such as creating flashcards to quiz themselves, answering old exam questions or attempting to list out all of the key dates without looking at the textbook, are much more powerful in aiding memory.

      get pupils to put everything they know about a topic or a theme onto one
      piece of paper. Compare them after to see what they missed

    Flashcards <span>‒ </span>
    <span>
      either create them for your class or support your pupils to create their
      own set, pupils test themselves by asking the questions and trying to
      retrieve the answer before turning over the card.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
$I

These types of retrieval practice activities should be spaced at relevant intervals. As mentioned above, pupils retain information better if there is a gap between learning, practice and subsequent practice.

You could achieve this by:

- Deciding on a particular day or week which you will incorporate practice activities into your lesson. For example, every Friday you will provide practice activities linked to previously learned material. You might include a new skill every week at first, and then every other week and then just once a month as you extend the time between pupils practicing that material.
- Including previously learned material in homework tasks as an opportunity for pupils to practise.
- Starting each day with a daily review or practice task, e.g. vocabulary, events or learning from the day, week or term before.
- A weekly or half-termly quiz which pulls a mixture of questions from previously learned material as well as newly learned material.

## Instructions

- Below are some ideas for you to practise related to **retrieval practice**
- Select **one** of the ideas for practice from **the area** to try out in your classroom.
- This will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with a colleague.
- You should also evaluate the effectiveness and impact of this in discussion with your mentor.

## Retrieval practice

- Starter for 10 quiz
- Speak like an expert
- Power paragraph

### By trying this activity, you will…

#### Learn that:

- 2.7 Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned
- 2.8 Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall

#### Learn how to: Increase likelihood of material being retained, by:

- 2i Planning regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time.

### If this is happening in your classroom, you will see…

- Pupils will remember material over a longer period of time.
- Pupils will be able to build on previously taught material when learning new content as they can recall it.
- Pupils will develop effective practice techniques which they can use themselves.

### Practise…

#### Starter for 10 quiz

- Choose a day which works for you (e.g. every Monday morning. If you see your classes regularly do this every week, if you see them less regularly, do it once a month or as appropriate).
- Let pupils know that on the designated day, they will have a fun ten-question quiz which will include questions from recent, and not so recent content.
- Tell pupils that it is low-stakes, and that you really want them to practise content they have covered because this will help them remember it.
- Set a big timer on the screen for ten minutes and let pupils go.
- Spend some time after the quiz going through the answers, modelling on the board if possible so they can see the correct way to do it and will be able to do it differently next time.
- You should keep a note of which questions the class consistently gets wrong, so this helps you to include them more often.

#### Speak like an expert

- Tell pupils that they will have up to two minutes to speak about a previously learned topic.
- They should aim to speak without hesitation or repetition.
- You could include a set of key vocabulary which scores them extra points if they use it correctly during their presentation.

#### The power paragraph

- This works well at the end of a topic or get pupils to do a power paragraph on a previously learned topic.
- Give pupils a time-limit, e.g. three minutes.
- Tell them you want them to write down as much as they can remember about the topic.
- At the end of the three minutes, hand out success criteria and get pupils to either self-mark or peer-mark to see how many of the key aspects they were able to remember.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In Year 1, you completed Block 3 ‘Developing effective classroom practice{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  teaching and adapting’. We focused on pedagogy and what it means to be an
  ‘effective’ teacher. You spent time in that Block learning about
  evidence-informed classroom practices such as breaking down material into
  small steps, high quality expositions and scaffolding. You also learned about
  adapting your teaching practice ‘in the moment’ so that all of your pupils can
  learn and make progress.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You have had a whole year to embed these skills and no doubt you will have had
  many successes. Becoming an effective teacher takes time and it is important
  you continue to practise and improve these core techniques. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This Block aims to enhance your understanding of ‘effectiveness’ by moving
  beyond this repertoire of techniques, where you were mainly focused on your
  own actions as teacher and how they correspond with your pupils' learning. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  First of all, we broaden the range of ways you engage with pupils beyond ‘a
  pupil’ and ‘the class’ by considering how you can effectively group your
  pupils to maximise learning and progress. Group and pair work can be an
  important strategy to help pupils learn and it is likely that you already make
  use of these types of collaborative activities in your teaching. In this Block
  we will consider{" "}
</span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  {" "}
  to make these activities truly effective, and in particular how to avoid
  common pitfalls such as wasting learning time, pupils losing focus or becoming
  disruptive and{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒ </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">most importantly </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒ </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">how to make sure they are actually </span>
<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">learning</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> through these activities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  There is considerable evidence to support the idea that pupils working
  collaboratively can improve outcomes. Beyond this, there are many other
  benefits to be had from pupils working together{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">‒ </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  they get an opportunity to develop social skills and learn from one another.
  However, doing this effectively takes skill and this Block will provide you
  with techniques you can use to ensure the collaborative work you ask pupils to
  do is high quality. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  We will also consider what influence you can have on learning outside of
  school through homework. We’ll consider the evidence in this area for pupils
  of different ages and think about the type of homework which actually leads to
  educational gains. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You will also look at how to adapt your teaching ‘in the moment’ ensuring that
  you meet the needs of your pupils without creating lots of unnecessary extra
  work for yourself. You are also encouraged to be more alert to the impact the
  actions you take have on your pupils. By the end of this Block, you will have
  covered all of the foundations which you need to be an effective teacher.

## Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice

We’ve all sat through training sessions where we are asked to work with a group of people, sometimes strangers, and answer a question on a sheet of flip chart paper. We can remember the awkwardness as we politely, but silently, negotiate who speaks first. There is the sense of danger as you weigh up whether being the person who records the ideas means you are excused from being the person who has to stand up and feed back, or if the fact that no-one can read your handwriting means that you will \_have \_to do it. We also remember the sense of frustration that one person is dominating the discussion, and that what they’re saying seems to be completely missing the point of the task. Bad group work is truly awful.

As a classroom teacher, you will probably have considerable control over the way you ask pupils to complete tasks. You will have learned a lot already about the practicalities of managing pupils in the classroom. When you first started teaching last year, you may have had grand plans for complex group activities only to find that managing behaviour and the ‘classroom traffic’ that this can create was a challenge. As a new teacher, this can take up a lot of your planning time and attention in class. You might have recognised that for many tasks, pupils can work effectively when working individually and as a result have minimised group work activities. This Block will give you the chance to think in detail about how to balance the benefits to pupils’ learning with classroom management and efficiency.

The evidence shows that planning opportunities for pupils to work, and in particular to practise, in both pairs and groups can increase their success:

- Group work fosters cooperation between pupils and thereby develops pupils’ social skills.
- It supports pupils to develop empathetic abilities and see things from multiple viewpoints.
- Pupils learn to compromise.
- Pupils can provide each other with scaffolding.
- The total sum knowledge of a group is higher than that housed within one individual; this may allow the teacher to set work that is more challenging.
- Pupils have the opportunity to restructure their own thinking by talking to others. (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017)

However, pupils will not automatically be good at this kind of activity and need to be taught how to do it well. You will also need to think carefully in your planning about the purpose of paired or group work in relation to pupils’ learning and the wider benefits to them: doing group work simply for its own sake may not be the best use of classroom time.

Your role as teacher is to:

- Explicitly teach pupils _how_ you want them to conduct paired and group work
- Support pupils to learn how to do paired and group work well by providing support during tasks
- Ensure that pupils have the opportunity to practise how to do paired and group work, recognising that it will take time for them to become skilled in it.

A number of elements can support group work to be effective, these include:

- Familiarity with routines
- Pupils’ prior knowledge in relation to the task
- How pupils are grouped
- Group goals, in which the group works together towards a shared goal, reward or recognition
- Individual accountability, in which the success of the group depends on the individual learning of each group member.

Have a look at the two examples below.

$I

<h3>
  <b>Example A </b>
  <b>‒</b>
  <b> Informal</b> group<b> learning</b>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher has not planned explicitly for group work but feels that the
      task should be performed in a group.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Pupils are given a task to carry out as a group but the teacher does not
      provide specific roles or guidance to the group beyond that they need to
      work together to complete the task: ‘You’re going to work together to
      complete the experiment, off you go.’
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Each pupil tends to carry out a separate activity which contributes to the
      completion of the task, but this depends on how functional each group is. 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Rewards are provided to individuals within the task: ‘Now you have
      completed the task, you need to write it up individually and I will mark
      it.’
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
$I

$I

<h3>
  <b>Example B </b>
  <b>‒</b> Structured<b> team learning</b>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher has planned explicitly for group work within the lesson,
      planning that there will be specific roles for pupils within each group:
      ‘Number 1s will find out about the reactions of Group 1 metals. Number 2s
      will get the information about their physical properties. Number 3s will
      find out about their uses.’
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher has also developed a set of success criteria around what good
      group work will look like and the team will be rated by the teacher
      against this set of criteria: ‘High performing groups will: speak politely
      and respectfully to each other, use group work voices (other groups should
      not be able to hear your conversions), listen to each other, encourage and
      support each other.’ 
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      The teacher monitors and provides feedback and guidance on the quality of
      both group work and task progress.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Pupils will also be assessed as individuals so that they take
      accountability for their role within the team: ‘Now we’ll have a quick
      test and see what you have each learned. We’ll mark your tests
      individually and then combine your scores to see which team has improved
      the most since last time.’

## How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation

$I

<i>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Effective small group work is not something that just happens when we put
    pupils into groups. […] For small group work to be effective, a number of
    elements need to be taken into account in the structuring of the task. […]
    The teacher needs to make clear that cooperation between pupils in the group
    is desired. 
  </span>
</i>
<p style="text-align: right;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                                                      (Muijs
    &amp; Reynolds, 2017)
  </span>
</p>
$I

There are many different ways in which pupils can be grouped, for example:

- Random pairs
- A pair of higher and lower attainment
- Pairs of similar attainment
- Random trios
- Trios of similar attainment
- Mixed ability trios
- Larger groups of four or more either of similar or mixed attainment.

It is important that you carefully consider how you are going to group pupils for the task you want them to complete. You will need to think about what each person within the group is going to do and why working in that way is likely to yield a benefit. For example, you might be teaching an English lesson which is exploring different characters' viewpoints. Grouping pupils for this task where they take on the viewpoint of a different character can help to bring the story alive. You might want pupils to complete a difficult piece of work ‒ using mixed attainment groupings in this instance can help to support pupils of lower-attainment. However, it is important to be mindful that the higher-attainment pupil doesn’t simply ‘take over’. It seems obvious, but you will also need to think carefully about the likely social dynamics of certain groupings: some pairs will demonstrate excellent social skills without much learning taking place!

You may get ‘free-riders’ within groups (Muijs & Reynolds, 2017). That is, pupils who are able to hide within a group situation and avoid completing work. Johnson & Johnson (1994) suggest that one way to mitigate against this is to assign pupils with clear roles. Using the same roles consistently in different group tasks will help pupils to become familiar with the routines of group work. Knowing what the different roles are, how each role contributes to the group task and practically what to do in each role is important pre-knowledge for pupils to be able to perform the roles and therefore the group work successfully. In different activities, these might include:

- **The summarizer**, who will prepare the group’s presentation to the class and summarize conclusions reached to see if the rest of the group agrees.
- **The researcher**, who collects background information and looks up any additional information that is needed to complete the task.
- **The checker**, who checks that the facts the group will use are indeed correct and will stand up to scrutiny from the teacher or other groups.
- **The runner**, who tries to find the resources needed to complete the task, such as equipment and dictionaries.
- **The observer/trouble-shooter**, who takes notes and records group processes; these may be used during the debriefing following the group work.
- **The recorder**, who writes down the major output of the group, and synthesises the work of other group members.

One simple way to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation is to ensure that you record how you have grouped pupils and make observations about attainment, behaviour and motivation based on that grouping. You can also give individual and group scores to pupils for work they have carried out in groups thus increasing individual accountability for the work carried out within a group. This should be carried out while pupils are working in groups so that it does not create unnecessary workload for you or take additional time for them.

  Teacher: As you know, this term our topic is ‘The Restless Earth’ and you have
  been learning about the causes and impacts of volcanic eruptions. In the last
  lesson, we learned about how volcanic eruptions can be predicted. Today we are
  going to be learning about what happened during the Montserrat earthquake. You
  will be applying the knowledge you have built up to a real-life situation. It
  would be helpful to have your knowledge organiser to hand so you can refer to
  the key terms where needed. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For this lesson, we are going to be working in teams. You are part of a team
  of volcano experts invited to the Montserrat Volcano Observatory to help the
  geologists manage a serious situation developing on the island. There have
  been a number of earthquakes and pyroclastic flows around the Soufriere Hills
  volcano. Now a dome is growing on the side of the main volcano. If it
  collapses, huge pyroclastic flows with potential to cause major loss of life
  will result. A helicopter pilot is in the air sending back reports. It is up
  to your team to collect the reports, map the volcanic activity and make the
  crucial decisions required to manage the situation.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, so let’s discuss roles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I am His Excellency, Frank Savage the Governor of the island. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each team requires the following members:</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Information coordinator</span>
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Your role is to monitor the reports coming in from the helicopter and take
  them to the rest of the team. You also need to take the decisions made by the
  crisis manager to the governor for checking.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Geologist</span> 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Your role is to make a map of the volcanic hazard, and work with the crisis
  manager on a plan for ensuring the safety of the islanders.
</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis manager</span>
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Your role is to make important decisions to manage the crisis. You have the
  reports from the helicopter and the advice of the geologist. After you make a
  decision, send your advice to the governor immediately. You will get instant
  feedback on your decision. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You will now have one minute in your groups to decide who is going to do what
  role. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  3, 2, 1… Hands up if you are the information coordinator… hands up if you are
  the geologist... hands up if you are the crisis manager.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each group needs the following resources:</span>
<ol>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      {" "}
      A3 map of the island for annotation by the Geologist

## Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils

Different schools take different approaches when it comes to how pupils are grouped at the school-level. For example, in some schools, pupils are grouped by attainment for classes in ‘core’ subjects such as maths, English and science and in mixed-ability groups for ‘non-core’ subjects (setting) or in all subjects (streaming). In other schools, there is no ability grouping at all. Primary schools may take a similar variety of approaches, grouping pupils by ability for some, all or none of the subjects and lessons throughout the week.

This is a hot topic, ‘ability grouping has been one of the most controversial educational practices for more than a century’ (Steenbergen et al., 2016). As a classroom teacher, you may not have full control over the decisions your school makes with respect to this. However, you do have a lot of control over how you group pupils within your classes.

Different forms of grouping seem to create different opportunities for effectively adapting teaching to students’ needs (Deunk et al., 2018). The evidence suggests that grouping pupils flexibly within classes is effective as it enables you to provide tailored support. This might be done in a couple of main ways:

- **Homogenous or within-class attainment groupings**

This means pupils of very similar prior attainment level working together for specific activities or topics such as literacy. This might involve pupils of similar levels of current attainment being grouped together on specific tables for example, but all pupils being taught by their usual teacher and support staff and following the same curriculum (EEF 2018).

The aim of this type of grouping is to match tasks, activities and support to pupils’ current capabilities, so that all pupils have an appropriate level of challenge while maintaining high expectations and access to a rich curriculum. This might enable you to spend more time with lower attainment pupils, using in-lesson intervention as an effective and efficient way to support them. The evidence on within-class attainment grouping indicates that it is likely to be beneficial for all learners, providing an average benefit of three months’ additional progress. However, there appears to be less benefit for lower attaining pupils than for others. In England, within-class attainment grouping tends to be more common in primary than in secondary schools (EEF, 2018).

- **Heterogeneous or mixed attainment groupings**

This means that pupils of diverse attainment levels are grouped together. This might allow for within-group scaffolding to take place, i.e. higher attaining pupils are able to provide support to lower ability pupils. There are some known positive effects for higher-attaining pupils of taking on this role.

It is important that you do not stick to one type of grouping, especially, within-class attainment groups because you run the risk of creating a perception that attainment is fixed. There can be particular implications for pupils who are considered low-attainment. Groups should be flexible _between subjects_, i.e. groups for literacy are not the same for maths and revert to normal mixed groups for other subjects – and over time – can be changed regularly in line with assessment data.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Th</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  e findings of the research on the effects of grouping by attainment on the
  academic and personal outcomes of students have suggested positive benefits
  for students assigned to high groups (Kulik &amp; Kulik, 1982; Kerckhoff,
  1986; Ireson &amp; Hallam, 2001). The progress of students in lower groups,
  however, was found to be delayed by one or two months each year, and their
  confidence and engagement were undermined (Higgins et al., 2015).

## Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set

Different schools will have different approaches to homework. The most important thing to remember about homework is that it is the _quality_ and not the quantity that counts.

## Potential benefits of homework

| Short-term                                                                                                                                                                                 | Long-term                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Better retention of facts and knowledge - Increased understanding - Improved information processing skills - Improved critical thinking skills - Possibility of extending the curriculum | - Development of better study habits - Development of better attitudes towards school - Encouragement of learning outside school hours - Independent learning - Time organisation |

Most schools will have a policy in relation to homework in terms of when and how much should be set. As a classroom teacher, you will not have control over this. However, it is likely that you have considerable control over the _type_ of homework set. It is difficult to isolate the effects of homework from other factors that might contribute to pupils’ achievement. The benefits of homework are largely dependent on its _quality_ and the extent to which it relates to what pupils need to learn within the class. For example, if pupils are set an entirely discrete homework project for a term that does not relate to what they are learning in lessons, it is likely that there will be fewer gains in progress.

Muijs & Reynolds (2017) exemplify this approach by suggesting several principles to follow, including:

- It should be integrated into the lesson or topic studied. One way to do this is to review homework at the start of the lesson. Homework is seen as an integral part of the lesson.
- Reinforces major curriculum ideas – homework should be challenging but pupils should be able to complete it successfully.
- Use a homework planner.

Homework is an ideal opportunity to apply what you learnt in Block 8 about effective study habits and increasing the chances of leaning ‘sticking’. Homework should complement your in-class work and your overall goals for what pupils will learn. Some ways you can do this include:

- Use homework tasks as an opportunity to balance repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills (e.g. include a section on previously learnt material in homework tasks).
- Plan regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time – when you plan a topic or scheme of work, also plan when pupils will revisit it through homework at later points in the year.
- Provide just enough support so pupils experience high success rates with challenging work – include worked examples or partially completed examples at the start of homework tasks.
- Increase the challenge by lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements, such as how this new topic interacts with a previously leant idea or concept.

## Grouping pupils effectively

- Home and away
- Talk partners
- Monitor group performance

### By trying this activity you will...

#### Learn how to:

- 4.9 Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice
- 4.10 How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation
- 5.5 Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective, but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils
- 4o Considering the factors that will support effective collaborative or paired work (e.g. familiarity with routines, whether pupils have the necessary prior knowledge and how pupils are grouped)
- 4p Providing scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue
- 5m Applying high expectations to all groups, and ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum

| In this activity, pupils will be in a ‘Home team’ and an ‘Away team’. It helps if you organise the classroom so that tables are in groups. Pupils should have necessary prior knowledge (such as how to work in a group) to be successful.Home team = mixed attainment groupingAway team = prior attainment groupingPupils have a group activity to complete as the Home team. In order to complete the activity, they need to go and work in their Away team on one aspect. This aspect can be tailored to pupil prior attainment.ExamplePupils are learning about how methods of police investigation have changed in the 20th Century ‒ they need to find out about DNA, fingerprints, CCTV, witness interviews. Pupils need to go to the Away team to find out about a particular method. The work can be tailored for the attainment group through:- Complexity of content - Amount of scaffolding - Adult support at the Away team table.Pupils will then return to their Home team and each take a turn at teaching the others in their group about what they learned with their Away team. |

| Pupil talk is a valuable way to support pupils with being able to write well later down the line. Ensuring high quality pupil talk is something which needs to be taught and practised. Using ‘Talk partners’ in your classroom is one effective way to do this. It’s likely you are already doing this to some extent already because you ask pupils to ‘discuss with the person sat next to you’. ‘Think, pair, share’ is a similar process.Using talk partners explicitly and regularly changes the dynamics of talk in the classroom. In a traditional classroom, talk is often between teacher and pupil. This can lead to some pupils who are confident dominating talk in the classroom and leaves other pupils with an option to ‘opt-out’ if they feel like it. By using talk partners and providing scaffolding (e.g. on key vocabulary or structures) all pupils have the opportunity to practise articulating their ideas.When you pose some questions in your next lesson, instead of expecting pupils to respond to you, use talk partners so pupils can first share their thoughts and ideas with each other.It is useful to mix up talk partners every few weeks so that it avoids the idea that this grouping is fixed and allows pupils to interact with others in their class. |

| It would be useful to share your findings (sensitively). If a group activity did not go well, it is not about never doing it again but finding ways to improve performance. One way to do this is to make sure pupils understand what their group could have done better.For example: ‘I am going to give you some feedback on how we did that group activity. I thought Group X performed really well. I heard them speaking politely to each other. I heard them asking each other good questions. As a result, their work is very good. Group Y did not do so well at supporting each other through the task ‒ you got annoyed with each other when you thought it wasn’t going well. What could you do differently next time?’ |

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As you established in Block 4, subject knowledge is of critical importance. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  This Block will focus on key aspects of your practice to support you in
  curriculum design and delivery. In particular, we will focus on how you can
  use your improved understanding of how the subject or subjects you teach
  ‘work’ to deepen and strengthen your pupils’ subject knowledge. You will build
  on your learning from Block 2 and Block 4 around how knowledge is constructed
  and developed and the different strategies you can use to support your pupils
  to become more successful learners.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Knowledge is built by linking new ideas to existing knowledge. We know that
  pupils are likely to forget what they have learnt without specific strategies
  to support them in transferring knowledge to their long-term memory, as
  covered in Block 2 and 8. We will look at tasks that support pupils to learn
  key ideas securely, and that build automatic recall of key knowledge through
  retrieval and spaced practice. In this way you can help pupils apply knowledge
  and skills to other contexts, and to think critically, by drawing attention to
  the underlying structure of problems and how concrete examples can lead to
  abstract ones. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  In the self-directed study materials, we will look specifically at how to help
  pupils build more complex mental models. You can support your pupils to do
  this by drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and
  principles in the subjects you teach. This will allow pupils to pin new
  knowledge to the foundations of the subject you are teaching; creating a
  logical system in which ideas, knowledge and skills are linked rather than
  stand-alone ‘facts’, easily forgotten. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As you established in Block 4, developing excellent subject and curriculum
  knowledge is a process that takes time. You will probably feel more confident
  now than you did at this point last year. However, continuing to work with
  more experienced colleagues who can offer you support, advice and practical
  strategies is an important part of your development as a teacher. This Block
  encourages you to do this in relation to longer-term planning.{" "}

## Content recap from Year 1

When we think about subject and curriculum knowledge, it is crucial to take into account how pupils learn and develop knowledge. The following list summarises key content from your first year. Read through it carefully to remind yourself about these key aspects of how pupils learn.

- Information in our long-term memory is organised into schemata.
- We can think of these schemata as ‘interconnected webs’ of information.
- ‘Learning’ is about developing our schema: adding new information, forging new connections and strengthening the existing connections between ideas.
- The more complex and interconnected our schemata are, the easier it is to make sense of new, related information.

## Building complex mental models

In Block 4, we looked at why subject knowledge is important and how it is constructed. You looked at how understanding builds on prior knowledge and the need to sequence pupils’ learning and address their misconceptions. Much of the focus was on how your knowledge of the subject(s) you teach would support pupils to develop their knowledge.

In this section, we are going to take things a step further, looking at how these basic principles can be used to support pupils to develop more complex _mental models_.

What do we mean by this?

In one sense, mental models are how we understand the world: they are a representation of how something works. Pupils will develop more complex mental models as they accumulate new knowledge. For example, in Early Years pupils will learn concepts of right and wrong and what rules are. As they gain new knowledge through experience and direct teaching of new ideas in KS2 and KS3 such as morals, rights and responsibilities and eventually citizenship and how the law works they will develop a more complex mental model related to why we have rules and how and when rules should be applied. As pupils develop a more sophisticated mental model they may behave in different ways, for example understanding that their behaviour can hurt somebody else and so the rule or law needs to be followed.

We will look at how as a teacher, you can help your pupils develop more and more sophisticated understandings of the main concepts in a subject, returning to them again and again. We will also look at how this process helps reinforce pupils’ understanding by strengthening their schemata. Now that you are becoming more settled and confident in your teaching, you will be able to think more about your longer-term planning, taking a bigger picture view than you do with individual lessons.

How do we do this?

## You should revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples.

It is important to identify the key ideas in a subject. They are the important concepts from which other subject concepts are linked, or inferred (Ball et al., 2008); the ones that provide the foundation upon which everything else builds. We know that students learn new ideas by reference to ideas they already know (Deans for Impact, 2015). Mastering the big ideas of a subject will make other knowledge and skills accessible, helping pupils unpick new ideas and think deeply and critically about the subject you are teaching.

  Teacher 1: I really like the idea of us doing all the practical activities
  around Viking clothes, food and settlements but one thing I think we really
  need to emphasise is the theme of invasion. It’s a key concept in history not
  just with the Vikings and it sometimes gets side-lined with all of the other
  activities. Understanding the impact of an invasion is really important. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher 2: I agree. It links to their topic in year 3 on the Romans so maybe
  we could make a point of asking pupils to think about the Roman invasion and
  what impact that had on daily life – I'm thinking things like religion as well
  as clothes. Then we can set an overall objective for pupils to compare the
  impact of the Viking invasion this term with the impact of the Roman invasion.
  What do you think?
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher 1: Good idea. We will need to think about how to activate their prior
  knowledge – maybe we can take them to look at the display in the Hall from
  this year 3? 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Teacher 2: They did a lot of work on cause and effect last term in History so
  it will be really helpful to continue building on that using the same writing
  frames and sentence stems. Comparing impact is going to be hard for some of
  them so we will need to plan carefully around that...

As you established in Block 4, when supporting pupils in mastering these fundamental ideas or concepts it is necessary to be certain they are securely learned. Often this means revisiting these concepts again and again over time, coming at them from different directions. For example, in mathematics place value is a key idea which underpins many other linked topics, such as addition and subtraction. Therefore, place value, once identified as a key idea, would need to be explicitly taught and revisited many times to ensure pupils master this.

This broad and deep understanding of foundational concepts takes time and should be an important consideration in your planning. Look at the table below for ideas on how to do this in practice:

| Identify the big ideas of the subjects you teach (these are the key ideas, principles, concepts upon which everything else builds). | Look at resources and consult with more experienced colleagues to answer the following questions:- What are the things that will provide a foundation for learning in the subjects you teach and will ‘unlock’ other knowledge and skills? _(For example, recognising sentence structures is key to being successful in English as pupils need this to analyse texts and to write effectively themselves.)_ - What is essential for pupils to know and do to be successful in the subjects you teach? _(In History, pupils would need to know what ‘bias’ means before looking at sources.)_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Make the big ideas the focus of your long-term planning.                                                                            | You want pupils to have a depth of knowledge around the big ideas so that they can access other parts of the subject:- Begin planning with the big ideas in mind. - Work out where they fit into your long-term plan before anything else. - When do the key concepts and principles need to come in the sequence to ensure that pupils are able to access other parts of the subject?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Revisit and repeat these big ideas over time in a meaningful way.                                                                   | Coming back to these ideas repeatedly is key to making them ‘stick’ in pupils’ minds:- Plan when you will revisit the big ideas over time to ensure deep learning. - Think how you will assess progress towards real understanding of the big ideas. - Use subject-specific language repeatedly. At all phases, pupils can be introduced and inducted into these ways of being in and knowing the world from the subject’s point of view. It will help them to build schema (see Block 2 and 4). This includes learning the specific, sometimes technical, language of the subject, and applying this language when talking about the subject and learning new, and more complex things (EEF, 2018). - Reduce the cognitive load by scaffolding learning to support pupils in learning the big ideas.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Take a variety of approaches to address the big ideas.                                                                              | Thinking of different ways of illustrating these big ideas, coming at them from different angles, will help reinforce the concepts.- Exemplify the concept in lots of different ways. _(In Science you might use atoms to underpin and explain chemical reactions and then in another lesson use them to explain energy. In English you might teach rhythm in poetry through limericks at first and later on look at meter through iambic pentameter.)_ - Use the big ideas to activate prior knowledge. _(For example, in History your pupils might already have covered the concept of democracy and you might have a short quiz to activate this prior knowledge before beginning a lesson on human rights.)_ - Create a variety of tasks that ask pupils to use the big ideas. _(For example, in Biology you might ask pupils to complete a worksheet around evolution for homework and you might set a paired task to solve a key question around evolution.)_ |

## You should discuss curriculum design with experienced colleagues and balance exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge.

As you explored in Block 4, it is important that you carefully consider how you sequence learning. In this Block, you will be building on your knowledge of sequencing to consider how you balance exposition, repetition of key concepts and skills, and provide sufficient time for pupils to practise critical skills or knowledge. More experienced teachers consider these issues for sequences of lessons.

Read through the following teacher’s explanation of how they think about the key elements in their planning and answer the questions that follow:

$I

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Designing a long-term plan adopts many of the same principles as designing a
  shorter sequence of learning. I start by thinking carefully about what it is I
  need pupils to know by the end. This allows me to focus on what's important. I
  think about how I will test that pupils have learned this information at the
  end through summative assessment but also how I will assess them throughout.
  We probably do some sort of rapid quiz most lessons – certainly once a week.
  This is good for me as I can see what each of them knows, but good for them
  too as it helps to reinforce the learning. Retrieving what they know helps
  strengthen their schemata.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I work backwards from the end point, thinking about how I will build pupils
  knowledge and skills to be able to fully understand the key concepts by the
  end. I consider what the foundational knowledge is that pupils need as the
  building blocks for learning and map these out thinking about how I will
  explicitly teach these. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  spend a lot of time thinking about the initial presentation of these ideas,
  and I often write out a version of what I want to say to make it as clear as
  possible. I always try to find clear graphical versions of what I’m saying to
  reinforce the message, such as using diagrams or images in order to make
  abstract ideas as concrete as possible. I also think hard about how to make
  sure each step of the exposition is clear before moving on to the next bit. If
  necessary, I will work through a model of the type of task I’m asking them to
  do, explaining my thinking at each stage.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I plan how I will repeat key ideas and concepts – I know that it is important
  that pupils have more than a surface-level understanding of these so I know I
  need to revisit and cover them in a number of different ways. I plan to space
  this out so concepts are addressed several times and I will assess pupils'
  understanding at each point. When I first started, I was concerned that this
  would be boring for the pupils, but I actually like the challenge of coming at
  the core concepts in different ways now. I’ve explained to the pupils why we
  do this – how it helps them to learn.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  I plan opportunities for independent practice, such as independent pupil
  writing. This will have been supported over the weeks of learning by explicit
  teaching of the concepts and high-quality modelling so that by the time I ask
  them to do something on their own, they have the tools to do it. When we're
  first working with a new idea or skill, I provide really structured practice,
  making sure I give them lots of guidance and feedback until they have really
  understood it. For example, after I’ve been through and explained how I would
  approach a task, we might do two or three more examples with the class telling
  me how they’d do each step.

While you will have built up good experience of planning over the last few months, teachers at every stage of their careers benefit from drawing on the expertise of their peers. In your mentor sessions in this Block, you will be working with an experienced colleague to discuss curriculum design.

## You should draw explicit links between the new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject.

When introducing a new concept to our pupils, there are five key strategies that we can use to support them in developing strong conceptual understanding:

$Figure
$Alt The flowchart lists five stages in the effective introduction of a new concept:&lt;p>&lt;/p>1) Begin with what pupils already know&lt;p>&lt;/p>2) Provide a clear explanation&lt;p>&lt;/p>3) Use examples to support understanding&lt;p>&lt;/p>4) Take steps to address common misconceptions&lt;p>&lt;/p>5) Plan opportunities for retrieval and spacing. $EndAlt $URL https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/edt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Image-10.2.1-Introducing-New-Concepts-Opt-1.png $EndURL $Caption $EndCaption

The following table explains why each of these strategies supports pupils to develop strong conceptual understanding and explains how this could be done in practice.

| Begin with what pupils already know (this could include revisiting the big ideas of a subject over time). | When we introduce a new concept, we can help pupils store it in their long-term memory by making explicit links to the big ideas that they are already familiar with. This also supports managing cognitive load (Sweller et al, 1998).Very often these links will be between the new material and the big ideas of the subject.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - Review prior learning – ask questions, recap or begin the lesson with an activity which makes pupils think about the related key concepts and ideas. - Ask questions explicitly about how the work links to the big ideas of the subject. - Preview material - tell pupils what they are going to learn and how it links to what they already know/the big ideas of the subject. - Use the curriculum to plan opportunities to revisit the ‘big ideas’ of the subject over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Provide a clear explanation.                                                                              | Although it sounds obvious, it's important that we consider how we explain a concept. It takes time to plan how to communicate new concepts in a clear, concise and unambiguous manner. Making concepts explicit through carefully paced explanation, modeling and examples can help ensure that students are not overwhelmed (Deans for Impact, 2015).This will alleviate the potential for future misconceptions or confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - Provide a meaningful definition of the concept using vocabulary and complexity of language which your pupils understand. - Consider the specific qualities or characteristics of this concept that pupils need to be aware of. - Decide how you can best communicate these to your pupils, including the use of verbal explanations, concrete examples, demonstrations, models or resources. - Build on the explanations you have used in communicating the big ideas in the subjects you teach, e.g. returning to examples or ‘themes’ which you are all familiar with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Use examples to support understanding.                                                                    | The simplest way to identify the qualities of a concept is to begin with a concrete example because:- It is easier for us to understand concrete ideas than it is to understand abstract ideas. - If we illustrate an abstract concept with a concrete example, pupils are more likely to understand and remember it (e.g. ‘scarcity’ by showing how budget airline flights fill up closer to departure).Most importantly, we should try to provide pupils with multiple examples or representations of an idea, as this will help them to gain a broader and deeper conceptual understanding.We should also consider including non-examples alongside our examples – this helps pupils to understand the subtle nuances of what a concept is and also what it isn't. | We can share examples in a range of formats. Our examples might be presented as part of our lesson content or we might provide experiences for our pupils.**Concrete examples:**- Pictures and illustrations - Descriptions - Video/audio clips - Stories - Scenarios - Analogies and metaphors. We must remember that analogies are effective only if we elaborate on them, and direct student attention to the crucial similarities between existing knowledge and what is to be learned (Deans for Impact (2015).**Experiences:**- Direct observation - Trip or visit - Role play - Virtual experience - Personal recollections.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Take steps to address common misconceptions.                                                              | When planning an explanation, we need to ensure we think about how we are going to address common misconceptions. Once misconceptions are embedded in the long-term memory, they can be difficult to undo. It is better to address them before or as soon after they occur as possible (Willingham, 2009).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Identify possible misconceptions:**Ask yourself:**- What misconceptions might pupils already hold? This could link to their understanding of the big ideas that link to this topic.- What do pupils typically misunderstand about this topic?**Ask your colleagues:**- What common mistakes or errors do pupils make when applying this concept in practice? - Who else could I talk to in my team who might have experience of teaching this concept before?Plan to prevent misconceptions forming:- Is there another way of communicating this concept that will reduce the likelihood of misconceptions taking hold?                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Plan for opportunities for multiple exposure.                                                             | Pupils need to encounter complete sets of information several times in order to fully understand the concept.The implication here is that we need to find ways to repeat and revisit our explanations throughout a lesson sequence for our teaching to be most effective. We should space practice over time, with content being reviewed across weeks or months, to help students remember that content over the long term (Deans for Impact, 2015).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Plan learning so that skills and knowledge are revisited multiple times over the course of a sequence of lessons. - Where appropriate to the age and stage of pupils use a starter activity to expose pupils to content/skills they learned in the previous lesson. - Plan for opportunities for pupils to retrieve information. Making this low-stakes and formative will not only help you get a sense of where the class is in terms of their subject knowledge, it will also help pupils to create and be secure in their background knowledge (Bailin et al., 1999). Importantly, it can also support pupils to determine the level of their own subject knowledge, and any gaps. The activity will also serve to reinforce prior learning and provide a starting point for new learning (Coe et al., 2014). |

| Practise...                                             | **At the end of each lesson ask pupils to make a link between their new learning and the big ideas of the subject.**You can demonstrate to your pupils that links to the foundations of the subject can be made through everything they learn. Embed opportunities for pupils to practise making links and connections between their new learning and the big ideas that underpin the subject.You could ask:- Is there a key idea we have covered that helps you understand this topic? - When else have we covered similar ideas? - Can you think of another character similar to this one? What makes them similar? - How might you link this idea to (diversity / mass / grammar and meaning / product life-cycle)?**Draw pupil attention to structures and links.**Pupils will not be able to make links between what they do not know so make sure that they have a good understanding of the big ideas that they will need in order to build a shared understanding of the subject. Once they have a secure foundation of knowledge built on the big ideas you identified, you can use this to help pupils make sense of new concepts.Practise using structures pupils already know in new contexts _‘we know this is the formula for X and you have practised using it for X, how could you use it here?’\_Cover the same concept in different forms: _‘What does this diagram show us about X?_’Use every opportunity for retrieval as an opportunity to build connections: _‘The quick quiz you did at the beginning of this lesson tested you on your understanding of X. Keep your answers in mind as we look at this…’_**Plan retrieval opportunities for the core concepts and principles and use these to help pupils form new connections.**Plan retrieval opportunities in places that will help pupils form new connections. This will not only strengthen and reinforce the big ideas but support pupils to make links between new content and existing knowledge.- Use low stakes quizzes to reinforce learning of key concepts and to support pupils to make links. \_For example, you might set a short quiz on descriptive techniques as a starter activity in a lesson in which pupils are asked to write descriptively._ - Consciously space out practice over time. When planning out your curriculum map, actively plan out when pupils will be quizzed on the core concepts and principles to match the learning outcome of the lesson.Use think/pair/share to get pupils to consider their learning of the big ideas and make connections. ‘_In silence you are going to have a go at working out the challenge on the board. I am going to give you two minutes… Now the two minutes are up, I want you to discuss how this links with X.’_ |

## 11.1a: What you will learn

### Time allocation

2-3 minutes (5 minutes with video)

### Instructions

- Look over the statements covered in this Block.
- Watch the video, which introduces what you will learn in this Block and why it is important.
- Take your reflections, and any questions you have, to discuss in your first mentor session.

### In this Block, you will learn the following.

| Learn that                                                                                                                                                             |

| 6i. Appreciating that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains or the age of the child).                                   |
| 6j Scaffolding self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.                                                                                                             |
| 6k. Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or self-assessment.                                                                                        |

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  As an NQT last year, you completed Block 5, which introduced you to what good
  assessment, feedback and questioning are.{" "}
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  assessment is the link between teaching and learning – it is how we find out
  the extent to which pupils have learned what we have taught them and identify
  any misconceptions they may hold. It gives us information which helps us
  respond to pupils through further teaching or feedback that pupils can act on.
  Effective assessment should always drive pupil learning.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  No doubt, you have created brilliant assessment tasks and issued high-quality,
  purposeful, personalised feedback which has supported teaching and learning.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It is important to remember that assessment can be part of existing
  interactions with pupils and therefore not add to your workload.  In Block 5,
  you explored how to ensure your assessment always matches the objectives,
  which will have saved you time and made sure the data you gather is always
  useful and practical. You probably still have moments when assessment takes up
  much of your time - planning, facilitating and marking - but this is
  undoubtedly something that will be refined and improved over time. In this
  Block, you will be encouraged to work with your colleagues to find more
  efficient approaches which will support you to manage your workload further. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Now in Year 2, we will support you to build on your learning and initial
  successes by deepening your knowledge in this area and developing further
  practical strategies. You will go beyond looking at what makes effective
  assessment to focus on how you can link assessment to metacognitive
  strategies. This builds on the work you did in Block 3 in this area. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You will also look at how to ensure feedback is of high quality: that it is
  specific, helpful, and drives learning forward. You will look in detail at
  strategies you can use to scaffold self-assessments, to provide model work
  that supports learning, and to always ensure you are giving effective verbal
  feedback. 
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  We will also spend some time looking specifically at peer and self-assessment.
  These strategies are often presented as a way to increase efficiency. However,
  the time saved is just time wasted unless pupils are doing this really well!
  You will explore how you can structure and facilitate self and peer assessment
  so it can be a valuable tool within the classroom.

## The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

| Learn that                                                                                |

| 6.6 Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning. |

## Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.

You will not be available or able to provide support all of the time to help pupils improve their work. This might be because you are working with a small group during an activity or it is an independent learning task, such as homework or self-study. In the longer term, you won’t be their teacher forever! You want to avoid a situation whereby all learning is dependent on you, the teacher, being available to offer support and guidance. To achieve this, you will need to think about how to support your pupils to self-regulate and to monitor their own learning.

This will not be automatic. In fact, pupils will need regular feedback on their attempts to monitor and regulate (i.e. take control of) their own learning. Over time, they will be able to do it without your support and this will both reduce your workload and mean that your pupils can make better progress in their learning.

You learned about metacognition and some strategies for teaching it as part of Block 3. You will remember that the EEF Guidance Report on Meta-Cognition & Self Regulated Learning (2017) tells us ‘self-regulated learners are aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and can motivate themselves to engage in, and improve, their learning’.

There are three aspects to self-regulation; cognition, meta-cognition and motivation (EEF 2017). All three are important, inter-dependent aspects of the learning process and you will need to consider each one carefully when thinking about how to help pupils monitor and regulate their own learning.

<h3>Key terms</h3>
<b>Cognition</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  : the mental processes involved in knowing, understanding and learning.
  Cognitive strategies include memorisation techniques or subject-specific
  strategies like how to solve an equation.
</span>

<b>Metacognition</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  : the ways learners monitor and purposefully direct their learning.
  Meta-cognitive strategies include planning what technique to use, monitoring
  if it is working and choosing to adapt if it is not.
</span>

<b>Motivation</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  : our willingness to engage in meta-cognitive or cognitive strategies. For
  example, convincing ourselves to revise for a test we have tomorrow.
</span>
<p style="text-align: right;">

When giving feedback to pupils, you should make specific reference to the cognitive strategies which they used or could have used. Be aware that because we cannot _see_ cognitive strategies, we are commenting on surface level evidence. Therefore, feedback might include:

- Restructuring understanding
- Confirming to students that they are correct or incorrect
- Indicating that more information is available or needed
- Pointing to directions students could pursue, and/or
- Indicating alternative strategies to understand particular information.

(Hattie & Timperley, 2007)

Giving feedback on cognitive processes will help expand pupil awareness of which cognitive strategies worked and what they could try next time.

Teacher: “Yasin, can you tell me how you solved the problem?”

Yasin: “First, I read all of the information and I noticed that the alarm is going off every 12 minutes and the light flashing every 8 minutes so to find out when they must both go at the same time I know I can multiply 12 and 8 to find a common multiple.”

Teacher: “So, you identified the key information from the problem, 12 minutes and 8 minutes, and you recognised that you would need to find a common multiple of 12 and 8. You used a good strategy to multiply 12x8 to calculate a time when both 12 and 8 would be going off. This has worked, but I wonder whether you considered if this would be the <em>first</em> time that the alarm and light would go off at the same time? Is there another possible answer which comes before 96?”

Yasin: “Hmm. I guess so. I didn’t really think about it.”
Teacher: “You have already identified that there needs to be a common multiple for 12 and 8 so why don’t you start listing all of your multiples of 12 and 8 to try and spot a lower common multiple”.

In Block 3, you learnt about the importance of explicit instruction on metacognitive strategies for pupils so they could more effectively plan, monitor and evaluate their own learning. Knowing how they learn and awareness of their learning through meta-cognition is the first step to being a self-regulated learner. After you have explicitly taught pupils the metacognitive strategies which they should use for a task, you can give specific feedback in relation to them.

For example:

- “You have clearly **planned** this essay, demonstrated through your coherent structure and the sequencing of key points. You need to **monitor** your time more effectively as you can see that the earlier paragraphs are longer and more detailed, but towards the end of the essay your points become less convincing as they are less developed with quotes and evidence.”
- “From your working out, I can see that you **evaluated** that you had made a mis-calculation by checking whether your answer worked. This is an excellent strategy and allowed you to go back and make the correction.”
- “Next time, you should **plan** how you will explain the characteristics by listing them out first. This means you will be less likely to forget one!”

Over time, as pupils have opportunities to respond to your feedback on their metacognitive strategies, they will develop the skills for themselves. As they get older, they will naturally begin to do this more, but with effective feedback this will happen sooner.

As Wiliam & Christadoulou (2017) tell us, ‘students will only act on feedback if they believe they can get better and so motivating students to believe in improvement itself becomes a key part of the challenge’. Not all types of feedback are equally effective in promoting learning (Hattie & Timperley, (2007) so it makes sense to start with those for which we have good evidence of effectiveness. Related to each, there are specific things you can do to support pupils in monitoring their own responses:

## Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.

We have spoken a great deal about scaffolding over the last year. Working with and learning from more experienced colleagues is the single most useful thing you can do to scaffold your progress as a teacher. As you will no doubt be aware, assessment can take up a considerable amount of your time and this in turn can have a significant impact on your workload. Gibson (2015) tells us that the most commonly reported ‘burdensome’ task is recording, inputting, monitoring and analysing data.

Colleagues will be able to provide ideas they have found work well with your pupils, especially in terms of how they manage to gather evidence from _all_ pupils in the class and then use this to adapt how they respond with their teaching. If you teach the same phase or subject, you may even be able to directly adapt their assessment materials for your pupils. You spent some time during the Block 5 Mentor Sessions engaging with colleagues on this topic: it would be valuable to continue this now that you are in your second year and looking to refine your practice.

$I

<h3>Working with colleagues</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  These are some questions you could ask colleagues about assessment and
  feedback: 
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      What steps do you take to make assessment efficient?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      How do you get the information needed?
    </span>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      How do you provide effective feedback?
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Try and expand the network of colleagues who you look to for support in this
  area. For example, it can be useful to talk to colleagues from outside your
  phase / department as it can help give you a different perspective. Your
  school may well have teachers who are identified as excellent practitioners.
  It would be worthwhile seeking these individuals out.{" "}
</span>
$I

Efficiency is not just about tackling the bottom-line issue of workload. Effective time management is about prioritisation and trade-offs. You should seek to spend the largest amount of your time on activities which directly and indirectly improve pupils' learning; and to minimise time where the benefit is less clear. Ideally, you will do all tasks – beneficial or not – in an efficient way, without compromising the quality and impact of what you do. Marking and whole-class feedback is an area where there is a lot of benefit to be gained and a lot of time to be saved. Techniques that increase the efficiency of assessment should therefore become integral to your teaching. Consider the following examples:

For example:Ο = circle any incorrect or missing punctuation﹏ = squiggly line underneath a part of writing that doesn’t make sense// = new paragraph needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Use group targets. | Sometimes, when you mark a class’s work, you will notice that pupils are making similar mistakes and you are having to write the same feedback each time. In this case, you could create a single feedback sheet with numbered points which you (a) write up on a PowerPoint slide and (b) note the corresponding number in each pupils’ book when they make this error. At the start of the lesson, pupils need to note down their specific feedback (e.g. numbers 1,4 and 5) from the slide and are given time to act on it.For example:1. You need to revisit the section on the effects of the earthquake and ensure that you have described at least 3 effects. 2. You need to ensure that you justify your reasons. For example, “I think the most significant effect was because...Doing this can free up time for you to write an effective model answer, produce a worked example or plan to reteach an element. Pupils seeing what good looks like is very important to their improvement. |
| Use highlighters.  | When you are marking work, you will tend to pick out the parts of the work that have been completed well and show the pupil the areas that need to be improved. A more efficient way of doing this could be to use different colour highlighters to indicate these. This will also mean that pupils have to do the detective work to identify what specifically needs to be improved.For example,Green – what has been done well Orange- spelling mistakes Pink – grammatical errorsAs with all effective marking, you will need to pick a couple of things for each. Avoid highlighting large sections of the pupils’ work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Supporting effective self- and peer-assessment

Self- and peer-assessment are often touted as a way of increasing the efficiency of assessment. This is where you ask pupils to either mark their own work or mark the work of a peer. The trouble is, unless pupils are good at this, the marking they do will be ineffective, or potentially even damaging to learning. Rather than avoiding these practices – for which there is good evidence of effectiveness when done well – you should guide and support your pupils to do them well. Typically, this will be done by providing examples of the standard you are looking for and providing clear, accurate and explicit guidance on the features of these good pieces of work.

Consider the following strategies for supporting pupils to do self- and peer-assessment well:

### Supporting self and peer assessment

| Strategy                                                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Exemplification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Use models - sometimes known as WAGOLL (What a Good One Looks Like). | By providing models of work at different standards, pupils learn what good looks like. Pupils can use the models to compare the work of their peers or themselves to identify similarities, and note differences to help them develop their learning in the future.Key details should be highlighted and the characteristics of work at each level should be made clear.Pupil feedback should focus on these objective points. | **History**- Following a series of lessons, pupils complete a piece of extended writing about the Black Death. - Pupils work in pairs and swap their work. - They are then provided with a WAGOLL that explains each of the following ideas, and demonstrates how they link together:- The **real causes** of the Black Death - The **causes that were believed** at the time - The **symptoms** of the Black Death - **Steps** people took to **avoid** catching it - The impact of the Black Death.- Pupils then compare and contrast their peers' work and provide feedback on specific aspects they have included and note points that were not covered, explaining or linking as improvement points. |
| Use success criteria.                                                | Pupils need to understand the requirements of the piece of work in order to be able to assess it.These could be provided by the teacher or – in the case of external assessment materials – adapted from the accompanying guidance to be appropriate for pupils.It is also possible to do this with the class and work together to generate shared success criteria.                                                           | **PE**- Pupils have previous experience of discus. The teacher asks pupils what needs to be done to ensure a discus is thrown effectively. - The teacher writes those points up as success criteria. - Pupils then work in groups of three, taking it in turns to throw the discus. - Each time one pupil does the activity, another pupil provides encouragement about what has been done well against the criteria, and one provides advice on how they can improve. - They then switch around so they all have a go at throwing the discus, offering praise and constructive feedback.                                                                                                                 |
| Create ‘how to’ guides.                                              | These are produced to explain how ideas/skills/processes related to a concept can be applied to different situations irrespective of the context. Pupils can use these themselves during self-assessment to identify actions they need to take if they are having difficulties.                                                                                                                                                | **Maths**- Pupils are working on questions related to 2D projectiles and identify that they are having difficulties. - They are provided with a ‘How to Guide’, which they use to check the process they have undertaken to answer the question. - By checking their working against the ‘How to Guide’ they should be able to spot what they are doing correctly and where they may have gone wrong. They can then write a note to themselves about what they need to ensure they do with future questions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

15 minutes

## **Instructions**

- There are suggested activities below for you to develop your classroom practice.
- Select **one** of the ideas for practice to try out in your classroom.
- This will require some additional planning either individually or in collaboration with a colleague.
- You should also evaluate the effectiveness and impact of this in discussion with your mentor.

## **Provide high-quality feedback**

- Adjust feedback to consider social factors.
- Use model work to scaffold self-assessment.
- Strengthen peer-assessment activities.

### By trying this activity, you will...

**Learn How To** - **Provide high-quality feedback, by:**

- 6i. Appreciating that pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains or the age of the child).
- 6j Scaffolding self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.
- 6k. Thinking carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or self-assessment.

### If this is successful, you will see...

- Pupils providing more elaborate and sophisticated responses to questions.
- Pupils are able to respond to questions well as they are appropriately pitched.

## Practise...

<h3>
  <b>Adjust feedback to consider social factors</b>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For a class you teach, consider how you should adjust your feedback to account
  for a range of social factors. For example:
</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      If you are using subject specific vocabulary, are you sure that the
      individual pupil receiving the feedback has a secure understanding of the
      vocabulary? If not, use the term and paraphrase/use an example to
      illustrate. For example,
    </span>
    <i>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
        {" "}
        “Can you re-do questions 1, 2 and 3 to show you have understood what a
        prime number is? Remember, a prime number is a number that can only be
        divided by itself and 1.”
      </span>
    </i>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Feedback should be kind, specific and helpful. Have a look at your recent
      written feedback – is it kind? Is it specific? Is it helpful?
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>

  <b>Use model work to scaffold self-assessment</b>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Developing pupils’ self-assessment skills
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can help them become more self-regulated and effective learners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For a lesson you have coming up, think about an activity for which you could
  provide an example which does and does not meet the assessment criteria. You
  could use work from previous pupils or develop your own. You should highlight
  the important features (strengths or weaknesses).
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Looking at different responses can support pupils to understand what the
  approaches are that they can take to the task. It is very important that there
  are success criteria attached to the model so that pupils are able to judge it
  (with your support).
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
  You could also do this activity in ‘real time’ using a visualiser, using it as
  a way to model your thinking as you work.{" "}
