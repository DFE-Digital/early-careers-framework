# Logging utilities for Google Cloud

Utility classes for logging to Google Cloud Logging.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 3.0+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or in
security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 3.0 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

## Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See the {file:CONTRIBUTING.md CONTRIBUTING} documentation for more information on how to get started.

## Versioning

This library is currently a **preview** with no guarantees of stability or support. Please get
involved and let us know if you find it useful and we'll work towards a stable version.
