  # NOTE: this is currently considered experimental, it's likely to change based on feedback.

  # BuilderHelper contains methods that expose the form builder's functionality
  # externally. The objectives are to allow:
  #
  # * rendering the error summary outside of the form
  #
  # * setting the id of custom form elements (rich text editors, date pickers,
  #   sliders, etc) using the formbuilder's internal logic, allowing them to be
  #   linked from the error summary
  module BuilderHelper
    # Returns the form builder generated id for an object's attribute, allowing
    # users to force their custom element ids to match those that'll be generated
    # by the error summary.
    # @param object [ActiveRecord::Base,ActiveModel::Model,Object] the object that we want to
    #   generate an id for
    # @param object_name [Symbol] the object's name, the singular version of the object's class
    #   name, e.g., +Person+ is +:person+.
    # @param attribute_name [Symbol] the attribute we're generating an id for
    # @param value [Object] the value of the attribute. Only necessary for fields with
    #   multiple form elements like radio buttons and checkboxes
    # @param link_errors [Boolean] toggles whether or not to override the field id with the
    #   error id when there are errors on the +object+. Only relevant for radio buttons
    #   and check boxes.
