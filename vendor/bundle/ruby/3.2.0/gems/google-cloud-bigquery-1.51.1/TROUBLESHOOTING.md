# Troubleshooting

## Where can I get more help?

### Ask the Community

If you have a question about how to use a Google Cloud client library in your
project or are stuck in the Developer's console and don't know where to turn,
it's possible your questions have already been addressed by the community.

First, check out the appropriate tags on StackOverflow:
  - [`google-cloud-platform+ruby+bigquery`][so-ruby]

Next, try searching through the issues on GitHub:

  - [`api:bigquery` issues][gh-search-ruby]

Still nothing?

### Ask the Developers

If you're experiencing a bug with the code, or have an idea for how it can be
improved, *please* create a new issue on GitHub so we can talk about it.
