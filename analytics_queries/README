These queries select the data used for analysis by TAD/IES/BMG. They can be used as follows:

cf conduit ecf-postgres-sandbox -- psql -c "\copy (SELECT pd.id, pd.user_id, pd.declaration_type, pd.declaration_date, (pd.state = 'voided') as voided, pd.evidence_held FROM participant_declarations pd WHERE course_identifier in ('ecf-induction', 'ecf-mentor')) to 'declarations.csv' csv header"

Substitute the database name and query as appropriate. Nathan Easey is the point of contact for questions around this.
