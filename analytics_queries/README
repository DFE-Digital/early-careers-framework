These queries select the data used for analysis by TAD/IES/BMG. They can be used as follows:

konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=some-file.sql

Konduit can be found in the scripts directory in DFE-Digital/teacher-services-cloud, it does what
`cf conduit` used to but it works with Azure. You need to authenticate and get PIM access before
running it.

Substitute the database name and query as appropriate. Nathan Easey is the point of contact for questions around this.

Note, the above process has been streamlined by moving the `\copy` command into the SQL files. Now we can run the `Makefile` to build the queries and run them one by one:
 * change to `$APP/analytics_queries`
 * run `make`
 * it creates a directory in /tmp/exports
 * then copies each of the queries into /tmp/exports and removes any \n characters

Now we can `cd /tmp/exports` and run the ones we need:

konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=declarations.sql
konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=induction_records.sql
konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=participants.sql
konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=partnerships.sql
konduit cpd-ecf-production-web -- psql --file=schools.sql

The CSV files will be deposited in our `/tmp/exports` folder. We can zip, password and upload them as normal.
